LiDAR is a remote sensing technology carried on a plane or helicopter, where a light beam is aimed at the ground, mapping everything in 3D \u2013 whether it be the tops of trees to the ground.,The mapping process would reveal the form of the ground surface under the dense forest cover, and is crucial for surveying central Angkor and the densely-forested Kulen hills.,\u201cThe LiDAR survey has now also shown that central Angkor was arranged around a road grid and that the Kulen Hills to the north of Angkor were the location of an extensive low-density urban area in the early ninth century, just as Angkor was beginning to expand,\u201d Fletcher said.,Fletcher also noted that the 15-year project was significant because the results had \"global relevance\" and \"relate to contemporary issues such as low-density urbanism and the risks of climate change.\",The team\u2019s discovery of roads, canals and urban landscape \u2013 which would rewrite Angkor's story \u2013 will be detailed in a two-part SBS One documentary titled ,Angkor Wat\u2019s Hidden Megacity,. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/83147-archaeologists-map-cambodia-angkor-lidar", "title": "Archaeologists map Cambodia's Angkor with airborne lasers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/133877-two-pronged-ofw-husband-wife,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective"},

Dovann Arrabis said his family inspired him to study hard and make the top 10 list of the civil engineering licensure exams. Photo by Dale Israel    ,CEBU CITY, Philippines \u2013 It was the crucial last semester of his 5-year civil engineering course when Super Typhoon Yolanda left his family homeless.,Dovann Arrabis was studying in Cebu City at the time 120 kilometers away from his hometown of Daanbantayan where his family was still living at the time. It was difficult for him to be far from his family, knowing that the eye of the typhoon was nearing his town.  ,But his hard work and perseverance prevailed in spite of the devastation Yolanda caused him and his family., ,Arrabis placed 10th among all board passers nationwide who took the May 2014 Civil Engineering Licensure Examination and was one of the two students from Cebu Technological University (CTU) who made it to the top 10.,Early afternoon on February 6, the new civil engineer was among those recognized at the capitol for being a successful scholar of the Cebu provincial government. For more than 10 years, the capitol has been providing financial assistance and scholarships for the province's top high school students who want to pursue higher education.,Arrabis, who was receiving a monthly allowance of only P2,000 ($45), recalled how difficult it was to study while his family was living in tents at home.   ,\u201cPagka ugma adtong Yolanda, niuli dayun ko sa amoa kay nabalaka kaayo ko sa akong pamilya, (A day after Yolanda struck, I went home worried to check on my family),\u201d said Arrabis, who \u2013 at the time \u2013 was working on finishing his college degree in the evening, while studying for his licensure exam in the morning.,Overcoming odds, ,The eye of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) was near Daanbantayan when it made landfall in northern Cebu in November 2013. The town lost communication and many of its roads became impassable. Hundreds of families lost their homes because of the record-breaking strong winds.,Arrabis said that because of the typhoon, he stopped going to school and stopped reviewing for about two months to help his family recover.,\u201c,Naguol kaayo ko ato niuli, after duha ka buwan naka-recover rapud ko,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I was shocked when I went home. After two months, I was able to recover.) He explained that the will to improve his family's living conditions inspired him to stay focused. ,When he returned to school, Arrabis did not waste time and hit the books immediately. \u201c,Mao to nga sige lang gyud ko ug tuon, tig kadlawn na ko makatulog, kung daot ko ron, mas daot pa ko sauna,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I would study until dawn and was even skinnier before.) ,\u201c,Syempre ang pamilya gyud akong inspirasyon ,(Of course, my family is my inspiration),\u201d said Arrabis, whose father is a carpenter and fisherman. His mother stays at home to look after his other siblings, the youngest of whom is 10 years old. ,Inspiration,Arrabis remembered the first time he got to the city as he entered the CTU-main campus. He saw tarpaulins of achievers and topnotchers being displayed at the gates and around the school.,\u201c,Nakapangutana ko ug kung ako naa diha pud unya, unsa kahay feeling,?\u201d (If my face appears on that tarpaulin, how would that feel like?) That was the question, he said, that guided him all throughout college.,After passing the licensure and making it to the Top 10, he said he was so happy and proud when he walked around the campus with everybody smiling and knowing him. More than that, he said his parents were proud of him.,Magna cum laude,Now working with the Department of Social Welfare and Development regional office for infrastructure projects, Arrabis is earning a basic pay of P29,000 ($654) a month since October, his first job offer. ,He now uses his earnings to continue to support his family. He also graduated magna cum laude at the CTU.,At the capitol, Arrabis got a medal, a plaque and cash incentives totaling about P50,000 ($1,127.89) in a ceremony attended by Governor Hilario Davide III and Vice Governor Agnes Magpale., ,Each college scholar of the capitol, chosen among the marginalized families in the towns, got cash incentives between P5,000-P50,000 ($112-$1,127.89) for finishing school. The amount received varies depending on the student's achievement and for passing licensure exams.,At the time, he must have felt truly proud. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/83189-cebuano-yolanda-survivor-engineers", "title": "Cebuano Yolanda survivor among top 10 civil engineers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial"},
{"content": "\nThere is only one way a perceived good leader can succeed in a bad system, situation, or institution: he must reform it first, if not transform it    ,Recalling a few years back the botched Luneta hostage rescue, we remember it precipitated angry calls demanding that President Aquino quit office for failing to avert the crisis that cost the lives of several Hong Kong tourists. ,That unfortunate event would later strain for a time the relations between Hong Kong and Manila. But going further back Luneta, calls for the President\u2018s resignation were already regular column fodders. In fact, even before Aquino could clock in a hundred days in office, some quarters had already demanded his resignation.,But why such a national \"penchant\"?,Many argue that our president exercises more powers, or that he is more powerful, than US president Barack Obama, as the former virtually controls the entire bureaucracy and has a vast influence that extends to Congress and the Supreme Court.,In comparison, we know how Obama was power-checked, others say check-mated, by the Republican-dominated and largely uncooperative Lower House, when majority of its members refused to fund the federal budget which resulted in a government shutdown in late 2013. The US Lower House, in effect, not only held hostage federal funding but more glaringly handed Obama an in-your-face \u201cwe are as powerful as you are, dude\u201d statement.,To better appreciate the vast powers and influence of our president, we refer to the impeachment of former chief justice Renato Corona as its almost perfect manifestation. I say almost, because public outrage, the political interests of senator-judges (vis-\u00e0-vis the upcoming midterm elections at that time), and Corona\u2019s own undoing via his \"unguarded\" testimony, among others, were in play.,The not-so-secret presidential push and inspiration, aside from \"clear instructions\" to allies in both houses of Congress, added up to the pressure for expedited proceedings.,Yet the vast powers of the president are held together by a delicate mantle of public trust, the maintenance or erosion of which can be as fickle as the weather gets, if we go by the latest round of trust survey ratings.,Regardless of the changing public mood, however, one thing remains constant: that the power enjoyed by the incumbent is contingent on the trust the public continually bestows on the office and its occupant, but really more so on the latter. This is, at least, in theory. And this is where the problem lies.,RESIGN. Filipino students hold placards calling for the resignation of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III after he delivers his second televised address on February 6, 2015.  ,We reckon that the election of Benigno Aquino III in 2010, while phenomenal on so many levels, has not much to do with his vision for the Philippines or how his program of action could register growth beyond his term. Rather, it has more to do with sentiments of people betrayed and shortchanged by his predecessor \u2013 a people desperate in their search for a leader who personified the complete opposite of the one they were about to replace.,In sum, the people placed their trust on the one man they believe would, could, and should cure the inherited ills from the Arroyo administration. This is hardly surprising at all under our patronage-driven and personality-based politics. Thus began the reign of Aquino as superman and president.,We cannot avoid discussing presidential resignation by not examining the failures of our political institutions, as well as open the conversation on the numerous attempts by various sectors to strengthen them. The institutional failures provide perfect havens to patronage and corruption, and until we do something fundamentally difficult to destroy these lairs, we will spend the rest of our productive lives digging deeper holes than plugging the leak, so to speak.,But to say that we preserve the status quo in the absence of a leader who is of the same mold as President Aquino is utterly irresponsible, if not downright stupid, and tantamount to insulting the millions, okay the thousands, among us who are better qualified to run the affairs of State.,Our aversion and resistance to presidential resignation is not without basis. For one, our unsteady political institutions still remain prone to subjugation by power wielders who come and go every 6 years or so, and whose combined tenures, so far, have only served to undermine rather than strengthen these supposedly impersonal democratic and therefore accessible institutions.,Understandably, there are many among us whose aversion is influenced by the character of the beneficial successor. (Being an institutionalist, this is the least of my fears.) What feeds more aversion is the uncertainty of the readiness of our institutions \u2013 unsteady many of them are \u2013 to once again be subjected to another round of changes before they could find traction as they undergo rehabilitation after a long period of \"maltreatment\" by previous administrations.,To be fair to the second Aquino administration, efforts were undertaken to flesh out results of its strategy, ,Daang Matuwid,. It may be devoid of vision, but ,Daang Matuwid, rallies people around one common cause and that is reforming public institutions. Whether these efforts have degraded patronage and minimized corruption is a different story altogether.,When Pope Francis came to visit the Philippines, Facebook was flooded with posters bearing the \u201cPope Francis for President\u201d slogan, maybe simply for being such an inspiring and unifying figure to a divided people.,Well, I have a bad news for them: even if Pope Francis succeeded President Aquino by some anomaly, chances are he will also fail just the same under our system as it stands, right as you read this. There is only one way a perceived good leader can succeed in a bad system, situation, or institution: he must reform it first, if not transform it.,So while no one holds the exclusive franchise to good governance, is there someone who can or would guarantee its continuity? That was a trap question actually.,Let me rephrase that by asking rather objectively, impersonally: Can our institutions afford to absorb, adjust, and manage (with relative ease?) the constant shifting of directions and priorities from one administration to the next in such a short period without losing focus on the core deliverables?,I hope each of us can muster our own answers and find our priorities of engagement. I have found mine in the last five words in the preceding paragraph that I believe can last me well beyond 2016. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Tony D.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande arrive in Moscow on February 6 to discuss with President Vladimir Putin a last minute peace initiative for Ukraine. Photo by Sergei Ilnitsky EPA MOSCOW Russia The leaders of Russia Germany and France agreed during late night talks in Moscow to draw up a plan to end fighting in Ukraine as rebels wage a deadly offensive in the country s east officials said Saturday February 7.A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than four hours of talks that wrapped up early Saturday saw the leaders agree on the drafting of a blueprint that would also include proposals from Ukraine s Petro Poroshenko. They were substantial and constructive Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters of the talks adding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande left swiftly afterward. Work is under way to prepare the text of a possible joint document to implement the Minsk agreements said Peskov referring to a widely flouted truce from September.A French official also called the talks constructive and substantial and said work was being done to pull together a document aimed at implementing the September truce.The three leaders who did not address the media after the meeting are to discuss the effort with Ukrainian President Poroshenko by telephone on Sunday February 8.The European pair s talks with the Kremlin strongman were seen an attempt to prevent the 10 month conflict in east Ukraine from spilling out of control as Washington considers whether to supply weapons to Kiev.The visit was Merkel s first to Moscow since the start of the Ukraine crisis while Hollande had made a brief stopover in December.Ahead of the talks Merkel played down hopes of a rapid end to the fighting that has claimed more than 5 300 lives since April.Merkel and Hollande first flew to Kiev on Thursday February 5 for discussions when US Secretary of State John Kerry also visited the Ukrainian capital.Kerry is set to meet Russia s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov at a security conference in Munich this weekend with the high level diplomacy seeking to resolve the worst East West crisis since the end of the Cold War.

READ xa0US urges Russia to commit to ceasefire in Ukraine We the US and Europe as a whole have to stand with Ukraine at this moment Biden said in Brussels. Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe. President Putin continues to call for new peace plans as his troops roll through the Ukrainian countryside and he absolutely ignores every agreement his country has signed in the past Biden said.The West and Kiev accuse the Kremlin of sending troops and sophisticated weapons across the border to bolster separatists in Ukraine. Moscow has insisted it is not a party to the conflict.Observers have warned that if the United States gets involved militarily the regional conflict could reach a dangerous new stage and become a proxy war between Russia and the West.Russia is already under heavy Western sanctions over its alleged actions in Ukraine and European Union officials said Thursday that the bloc would blacklist more Russian individuals.The sanctions already in place along with low oil prices have dealt a blow to Russia s economy but have failed to force Putin to change tack over Ukraine.Ahead of the talks Hollande said a ceasefire should be the first step on the path to a comprehensive settlement. Kerry voiced support for what he called a helpful Franco German plan. READ xa0Putin Merkel Hollande urge Ukraine ceasefire President Putin can make the choices that could end this war he said.Evacuating civiliansRebel and Ukrainian forces on the ground agreed a ceasefire for several hours Friday around the battleground town of Debaltseve to allow civilians to leave both sides said.An Agence France Presse journalist in Debaltseve said some 25 city buses sent by both the rebels and the Kiev government left the shattered town to take civilians out although only one separatist bus was full.The sound of sporadic shelling could be heard in the distance but mortar bombardments in the town itself had halted after days of fierce fighting.Hundreds of civilians have been killed over recent weeks in east Ukraine as fighting spiralled after insurgents ignored the earlier truce deal and pushed into government held territory.One civilian and two soldiers were killed Friday and 25 wounded in fighting over the past 24 hours a government official said.

{"content": "\nThis, of course, does not mean we let go of our responsibility to question    ,  ,Being non-Catholic, I was not as thrilled spirituality-wise with the Pope's visit last January.,Many Filipinos braved crowds and waited hours just to get a glimpse of the man they call Holy Father. I still find it interesting that back then people said they were overwhelmed and moved to tears when he passed by. ,One believer said on social media that it felt like \",nilukuban ka ng Ispirtu Santo, (you were filled with the Holy Spirit),\" as the Argentine pontiff whizzed by in his jeepney-styled popemobile.,But when I think about the many devout Catholics of this country who cling to their faith to make things better, the thousands of typhoon victims surpassing their struggles because they believe in and draw strength from their religious beliefs, suddenly Pope Francis, his presence in Tacloban, and his many stops in Manila become more important for me. ,Apparently, regardless of my personal beliefs, his visit did matter to a lot of people. Their truth is theirs to believe in. ,The oddity of it all,It seemed odd to me when my superiors instructed us to treat our respective assignments for Pope Francis' state and pastoral visit like it was our own beat, i.e. the issues, sectors, and/or institutions we cover on a daily basis.,That meant churning out stories containing usable information to minimize foreseeable harm for the millions who would troop to the venues of his talks and sermons.,It also meant listening as much as I could to people who didn't think the way I did.,These are people whose lives circled around \u2013 and whose actions were driven by \u2013 their Catholic faith.  ,Assigned to cover ,the Pope's encounter with the youth at the University of Santo Tomas,, I talked to ,young Thomasians, about what they thought about ,this rockstar of a Pope,. ,Most of them, saw him as a symbol of hope, of love, of the brand of Catholicism their church should aspire to. ,Their truth is theirs to believe in. (READ: ,The irresponsibility of rabbits,),Global influencer,Influencers like Pope Francis generate a great deal of news. Whether they like it or not, their actions matter.,There is no doubt about Francis' tremendous reach. He has a following of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. His words are given much weight by many, and his appeal transcends religious boundaries. ,With millions heeding his call, each move he makes and word he utters could translate to the world becoming a better or alternatively a worse place. ,While I personally detest the kind of influence Pope Francis wields (seemingly coming from a system that homogenizes people's beliefs), I have no control over those who genuinely choose to believe him and the Catholic Church. ,Again, their truth is theirs to believe in. After all, such beliefs were honed mostly due to structures I and many others were born into.,This, of course, does not mean we let go of our responsibility to question. (READ: ,3 in 5 priests live in a material world,),It just means that we understand that global influence matters in a world where people's actions and daily choices are shaped by the men, women, and institutions that influence them.,Influencers are newsmakers whether they like it or not, and perhaps more importantly, whether I like it or not.,\"Be healthy,\" our editor told us when we were preparing for the papal visit. ,\"Welcome the Pope,\" she said. \"Your belief or non-belief should not get in the way of a good coverage.\" ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/buena-bernal/82375-pope-francis-coverage-non-catholic-reporter", "title": "Their truth is theirs to believe in", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/150044-star-magic-ball-2016-kim-chiu-xian-lim-kimxi,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/video/reports/81246-pope-francis-to-youth-on-loving-and-receiving-love?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=referral&utm_medium=share_bar,http://www.rappler.com/specials/pope-francis-ph/81176-ust-youth-testimony-pope-francis"},

What was supposed to be a two-week visit for them has since turned into almost two years together    ,Back in 2005 and for about 10 years before, I was living in the UK, studying architecture and working 9-to-5s in different architectural practices.  I had great employers and colleagues and although I enjoyed my work, I couldn\u2019t help but feel there was something missing. There had to be more to life than walking into the same building every day, seeing the same people and doing pretty much the same things over and over again.,MEMORY. The day we met.

All photos provided by Kach Medina or Jon Howe,I decided it was time for a serious change in my life, so I saved for a year, sold my car and anything else that could be sold, bought a one-way ticket and left the UK with nothing but my backpack. It was whilst travelling through Laos by motorbike with my best friend that I stumbled across this young Filipino backpacker. ,I instantly felt she was different from all of the girls I met while backpacking, and we hit it off straight away. Although we went our separate ways shortly after, we kept in touch. After two months, Kach came to visit me in Hanoi for two weeks, where I had set myself up as an English teacher. Well, two weeks has since turned into almost two years, 7 countries, many random jobs and countless stories to tell!,Whilst I traveled quite a bit as a child, with my parents working in Africa, when you travel as an adult you see things differently and it changes you \u2013 sometimes in very subtle ways, sometimes more obviously.

Having left Britain some time ago and having now been with Kach for over a year, I thought I\u2019d reflect on some of the things I\u2019ve learned being in a relationship with a Filipina and how I may have changed in the process.,Open arms. Open doors . ,In the UK, if a person, known or unknown, were to arrive at your door, for what we\u2019ll assume is some good and honest reason, then you would at first be a little suspicious. \u2018They must want something from me,\u2019 you would think, or even more sadly, \u2018What? A person? At my door? How strange!\u2019,Reunion with friends and family in Singapore ,Now, in stark contrast, if you find yourself at the front door of a Filipino and are invited inside, then you\u2019ll discover that they are some of the warmest, most welcoming people on the planet.

I\u2019ve always been accustomed to one or two pieces of bacon or a juicy Cumberland sausage in the morning, but now I get mood swings if I haven\u2019t eaten half a pig and a kilo of rice by 9am! ,Ah, karaoke.,I\u2019ve always been a little partial to loudly and drunkenly screaming out Bon Jovi\u2019s \u201cLivin\u2019 on a Prayer,\u201d but since being with Kach I\u2019ve developed a sixth sense, which I have decided to call, \u2018Microphonia.\u2019 I can sense a Karaoke machine within a 20-mile radius and I\u2019m quite prepared to kill for a can of Red Horse beer and the chance to sing Pusong Bato in a bar full of random strangers!,I will never haggle like a Filipino,Growing up in Africa, I had plenty of opportunities to observe my parents negotiating down the price of everything from fruit and vegetables, to decorative woodcarvings and even (ahem) speeding tickets. So obviously some of this bargaining power must have rubbed off on me, right?,Sure, I can get a few dollars off the price of some tourist souvenirs in the market and maybe even bargain down my overnight bus ticket a little, but I\u2019m no match for Kach.,Bargain smile (and exhausted vendor!),For Kach, everything is a potential discount, matter how small. She will quite happily spend half an hour trying to negotiate 5 cents off the price of an apple and then perform a victory dance on upon completion of the deal! She never even wanted the apple. ,(READ: ,5 tips for your budget trips,),The mysterious truth,It\u2019s a well-trodden stereotype in the West that Asian women are exceptionally loving, loyal and generous to their men and this is certainly true of Filipino women (though I\u2019ve only known one!). ,However, let it be crystal clear that this is not the same as subservient; personally I want a relationship, an equal partner. It\u2019s the little things that count, like lovingly prepared home-cooked meals every day and random head massages \u2013 not because you asked or she feels she has to, but because she wants to.,Be sure not to take her for granted though. She may be extremely loving, caring and loyal, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll let you get away with being a shit boyfriend or husband. \u2018Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\u2019 does not even begin to describe an angry Filipina \u2013 You have been warned!,Kach often tells me that although many Filipinos are very patient, if you push them too far, they could really hurt you. Of course, I think she\u2019s probably just trying to scare me, but would you take that risk with the woman who watches you sleep?!,So there you have it: 5 things I\u2019ve learned after almost two incredible years together.

Photo from Rikki Macolor,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 When Pope Francis addressed young people during the 2013 World Youth Day, he challenged them to be \"revolutionaries, to swim against the tide.\", , \"I am asking you to rebel against this culture that sees everything as temporary and that ultimately believes that you are incapable of responsibility, that you are incapable of love,\" he said., , It is this responsibility and the capacity for love which Thomasian electronics engineer Rikki Macolor took upon himself when he invented a light night that runs on solar power, prototypes of which were eventually deployed to Yolanda-hit areas in the Visayas., , Macolor is set to testify Sunday, January 18, before the Pope who called on the faithful to go against the prevailing culture of indifference among this generation's young.,His invention, the solar night light, came through a partnership with a non-governmental organization and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority.,The partnership offer was sent to different schools, and his college's dean at UST shared it to students like him. \"They saw our drive to help,\" said Macolor on why they were chosen.,UST eventually funded his group to create their own portable version which takes about two to 3 hours to assemble.,When Yolanda made landfall, Macolor was in Davao City conducting a workshop to community members on how to assemble a unit on their own.,Family troubles, , It was not always a smooth ride for Macolor's faith who had questioned why troubles kept coming his way \u2013 from his family's lack of resources to finance his college education to the painful state of his mother struggling to overcome various health issues., , His mother, who he says is \"like a very dear friend,\" suffered a kidney and liver disease 3 years ago. \",Sumasama din yung loob ko, (I also harbor resentment sometimes),\" he said, questioning God why he is beset with problems left and right despite what he has done for the community., ,But he said his Catholic faith is \"something that keeps me sane.\" , , \"Despite everything I've been through, it's something that I can really hold on to,\" he added., , Macolor believes the Pope's arrival in the Philippines is such a \"fulfillment\" for him and the roughly 80 million Catholics of the country.,Pope Francis' presence in Macolor's alma matter makes the Argentine pontiff's visit even more special. ,The University of Santo Tomas (UST), the second university in the world to be given pontifical status, has been visited by the previous popes thrice in the past. (READ: ,What you need to know: Pope Francis' UST visit,),Pope Francis is the third pope to visit UST, and his visit is the fourth time by a current leader of the world's Catholics.

Photo from Rikki Macolor,Setting an example,In 2002, Macolor was forced to drop out of school due to strained finances., , During his 6 years of working even without a college degree, he was able to help send his younger sister to college. Also a Thomasian with a degree on interior design, his sister now works as a web developer., , In his more than half a decade of working, he kept thinking about how his dad has \"reached a certain age and it was not a time to give up.\", , \"My dad didn't even know I dropped out of school, filed a leave of absence. He talked to me very intimately. He was in tears when he found out,\" Macolor shared., , But after his sister's graduation, Macolor went back to school and enrolled at UST., , He said he wanted to set an example for kids who he can encourage to finish their studies. \"That they should not take for granted what they have\u2026 I see a lot of kids ,di masyado concern yung pagaaral ,(who are not too concerned about their schooling). But it's more than the degree. It's about the discipline you instill to yourself.\",TEACHING. Rikki Macolor teaches a villager how to assemble a small solar panel for his invention. Photo from Rikki Macolor,Giving back,For Macolor, his invention is his way of giving back. The invention is also his offering to the Lord, a prayer of sorts for the healing of his mother.,\",Hindi naman ako doctor... I know that I can not really do anything for my mother na may sakit. Ito yung kaya kong gawin. Ito yung connection ko with the Lord by doing what I can in my own profession,,\" he explained., , (I am not a doctor... I know that I can not really do anything for my mother who is sick. This is what I can do.

There is a smile in the face of Macolor's mother when she sees in television shows how her son has helped communities in far-flung areas, and this in turn gives Macolor greater drive to pursue his advocacy. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/specials/pope-francis-ph/81176-ust-youth-testimony-pope-francis", "title": "Pope, a young Thomasian and going vs the tide", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/specials/pope-francis-ph/80426-pope-francis-ust-visit,http://www.rappler.com/specials/pope-francis-ph/80795-ust-pope-francis-youth-encounter"},

Mejias at the barangays,\" he said.,The shooting incident happened when the convoy of Mejias was at the vicinity of the market.,On the late response, Guerrero explained that it is the standard operating procedure of authorities not to immediately respond to violent incidents because they first have to ensure their own safety before coming in.,During the confrontation between Guerrero and APP leaders after the incident, a man in military uniform was seen nearby.
