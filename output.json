A young child waves the national flag as crowds gather in front of the Greek parliament in Athens. Photo by Louisa Gouliamaki AFP ATHENS Greece Greece s anti austerity leaders were back in Athens Friday vowing to keep their promise to renegotiate the country s huge loans despite having little to show after a European tour aimed at winning allies to their cause. We are a sovereign country we have democracy we have a contract with our people we will honour this agreement Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told his hard left Syriza party in their first meeting Thursday since the January 25 elections.In a remarkable show of support thousands of people then gathered outside parliament standing silently in Syntagma Square the scene of violent anti austerity protests in recent years. We have nothing to lose said Stavroula Drakopoulou a 55 year old teacher. An estimated 500 people also gathered in Greece s second city Thessaloniki.Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis visited Paris London Rome Frankfurt Brussels and Berlin in the past six days to try to win over EU leaders to their plan to ease the crushing burden of Greece s debts.The tour began well but ended with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble restating his country s opposition to debt relief and expressing deep scepticism over the Greek government s proposals to restructure its EU IMF loans. We even didn t agree to disagree a downbeat Varoufakis told reporters after talks with Schaeuble in Berlin Thursday.The Greek minister will hope for a more sympathetic ear when he hosts a meeting with US Treasury deputy assistant secretary Daleep Singh later Friday.US President Barack Obama gave Athens a boost last week when he warned against squeezing debt ravaged countries such as Greece whose economy has shrunk by one quarter since 2008.Meanwhile Tsipras must prepare for his first European summit in Brussels on February 12 which will be his first meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Finance ministers from all 19 eurozone countries will gather the day before to discuss the stand off over Greece.In a sign of the pressure Athens is under to reconcile its domestic promises with its obligations to foreign lenders the announcement of the government s legislative agenda was delayed from Saturday to Sunday evening.Blows from Berlin and FrankfurtSyriza is the first anti austerity party to take power in Europe and its opening move to halt key privatisation projects spooked the markets and raised anew fears of Greece being forced out of the eurozone.The government also said it would no longer cooperate with the hated troika of auditors from the European Union European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund who are charged with enforcing the terms of Greece s 240 billion euro 275 billion bailout.Tsipras and Varoufakis later softened their tone and their creative proposals for restructuring Greece s loans were well received by many economists.But Germany viewed by many Greeks as the main obstacle on any easing of austerity remains opposed.A debt write down was not up for discussion Schaeuble said adding that he was unable to hide my scepticism... that some of the measures do not go in the right direction .Varoufakis had earlier made a comparison between Greece and Germany in the 1930s when punitive measures imposed after World War I led to the rise of the Nazis. If you humiliate a proud nation for too long... without light at the end of the tunnel then the pressure will rise in this country at some point Varoufakis said.Athens also took a blow from the ECB which announced late Wednesday that it would no longer take up junk rated Greek government bonds from the country s struggling banks.Europe s stock markets and the euro fell on the news while Greek stocks plunged more than nine percent in early trading on Thursday before recovering to close 3.37 percent down.The Athex general index opened largely stable on Friday.While the move ratcheted up the pressure Athens insisted its banks were safe as long as they still had recourse to emergency liquidity from the Frankfurt based central bank.The ECB has given the green light to make up to 60 billion euros 68.5 billion in emergency liquidity available to Greek lenders.

The player takes control of Grayson a.k.a Sir Galahad as he does The Order's will and completes his missions with either stealth or brute force.,The game's visuals are impressive. At first glance, it is hard to tell whether you are looking at a high budget animated movie or a video game. The texture and lighting are amazing and effective that we often find ourselves immersed at the game's environment and atmosphere. The Order: 1886 redefines the concept of story delivery in video games.,The transition between cinematic storytelling and actual gameplay is seamless and players will find it natural to move Grayson into action while a story event is being played out. This really helps in immersing players into the story. The game runs at 30 frames per second, ideal for achieving a cinematic feel.,The game's third-person-shooter mechanics are standard and easy to get into. The Order: 1886 favors shoot and cover gameplay similar to The Last Of Us and Uncharted.,There are other mechanics thrown in such as bullet time and quick time events. While in cover, you can initiate an attack in slow motion for better control and accuracy. This slow motion attack or bullet time event is breath taking to look at as Grayson switches stance after stance as he guns down each enemy that he sets his sights on.,There are also cinematic quick time events that require the player to press a series of buttons in succession as they are displayed while an event is unfolding in order for Grayson to successfully perform his maneuvers. In some missions, Grayson is required to move stealthily and employ his knife and hand to hand combat expertise for stealth kills.,The game unfortunately does not have a cooperative or multiplayer feature. The lack of this feature is rare for modern shooting games.,It would have been fun to play against other players using the game's armory of steampunk style guns.,The Order: 1886 is set to come out on February 20, 2015., ,Bloodborne,Along with The Order: 1886, we also got to play Bloodborne.,Bloodborne is a third-person action RPG developed by the acclaimed Japanese game developer FROM Software (Armored Core Series, Demons' Souls, Dark Souls 1 and 2). The game was made exclusively for the PS4.,The game takes place on Yharnam, a ruined city cursed with a plague that turns its citizens into monsters. The player takes on the role of the Hunter, a lone adventurer who seeks the rumored medical remedy within the city.,The city of Yharnam is breathtaking. Its design is inspired by victorian architecture and the atmosphere is dark and gothic. The houses and streets lie in a state of ruined beauty, giving these places an eerie and abandoned look. Houses have broken floorboards, cobwebs, tattered piles of books and papers, frayed tapestries, and shattered mirrors. The rooms give off a feeling of history and loneliness, as if decades had passed without any living soul setting foot in their halls. The streets are littered with piles of bricks, broken barrels, abandoned coaches, and rotting corpses.,The environment somewhat evokes scenes from Lovecraftian lore, as if HP Lovecraft himself helped in the level design. The graphics are beautiful and effective in immersing the player in the atmosphere. It's definitely a huge step forward from FROM Software's previous game, Dark Souls II.,We encountered several enemies in the game such as infected city folk and rabid monster dogs. Enemy movement is convincing and unpredictable. Encounters tend to become dangerous when you fight mobs of enemies, often resulting in the death of the player character.,This intense difficulty appears to be the selling point of the game as it rewards players who learn from their mistakes and take the time to learn the game's combat system.,Throwing pebbles at enemies to lure them one by one was a strategy we came up with after suffering several defeats.,The Hunter can equip two weapons, one in each hand. In our case, the character we used had an axe for the right hand weapon and an old firearm on the left. The firearm resembled an old flintlock pistol, just like the ones you would see on pirate movies.,Combat is challenging since it requires you to read your opponent's moves and strike when they are vulnerable. There are no shields in this game so you will need to dodge and roll to evade enemy attacks. This kind of mechanic teaches the player to be careful and avoid being over zealous when attacking.,DEMO. Sony's Arata Naito (L) talks with Rappler's Michan Lorenzo (R) as she tries out the two new games. ,We asked Naito Arata, Sony Asia Region Marketing Manager, a few questions about Bloodborne during the demo:,Rappler:, Is this game related to the Dark Souls series?,Arata:, Well it's being created by the famed company, FROM Software, but we see this game as some sort of spiritual successor to PS3's Demons' Souls.,Rappler:, Is this going to have the same brand of difficulty as the other FROM software game like Demons' Souls and Dark Souls?,Arata:, It's difficult but we don't want to describe it as a difficult game. Again, it's a challenging game but by observing the environment and the enemies you can always find out how to survive. I'm not a super gamer and my reflexes is not super good but I can survive and beat the enemies because I can understand how enemies will move.,Overall, Bloodborne promises to be a rewarding game to beat. It is set to be initially released on March 24, 2015. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/83149-the-order-1886-bloodborne-ps4-impressions", "title": "First impressions: The Order: 1886 and Bloodborne", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating"},

Dovann Arrabis said his family inspired him to study hard and make the top 10 list of the civil engineering licensure exams. Photo by Dale Israel    ,CEBU CITY, Philippines \u2013 It was the crucial last semester of his 5-year civil engineering course when Super Typhoon Yolanda left his family homeless.,Dovann Arrabis was studying in Cebu City at the time 120 kilometers away from his hometown of Daanbantayan where his family was still living at the time. It was difficult for him to be far from his family, knowing that the eye of the typhoon was nearing his town.  ,But his hard work and perseverance prevailed in spite of the devastation Yolanda caused him and his family., ,Arrabis placed 10th among all board passers nationwide who took the May 2014 Civil Engineering Licensure Examination and was one of the two students from Cebu Technological University (CTU) who made it to the top 10.,Early afternoon on February 6, the new civil engineer was among those recognized at the capitol for being a successful scholar of the Cebu provincial government. For more than 10 years, the capitol has been providing financial assistance and scholarships for the province's top high school students who want to pursue higher education.,Arrabis, who was receiving a monthly allowance of only P2,000 ($45), recalled how difficult it was to study while his family was living in tents at home.   ,\u201cPagka ugma adtong Yolanda, niuli dayun ko sa amoa kay nabalaka kaayo ko sa akong pamilya, (A day after Yolanda struck, I went home worried to check on my family),\u201d said Arrabis, who \u2013 at the time \u2013 was working on finishing his college degree in the evening, while studying for his licensure exam in the morning.,Overcoming odds, ,The eye of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) was near Daanbantayan when it made landfall in northern Cebu in November 2013. The town lost communication and many of its roads became impassable. Hundreds of families lost their homes because of the record-breaking strong winds.,Arrabis said that because of the typhoon, he stopped going to school and stopped reviewing for about two months to help his family recover.,\u201c,Naguol kaayo ko ato niuli, after duha ka buwan naka-recover rapud ko,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I was shocked when I went home. After two months, I was able to recover.) He explained that the will to improve his family's living conditions inspired him to stay focused. ,When he returned to school, Arrabis did not waste time and hit the books immediately. \u201c,Mao to nga sige lang gyud ko ug tuon, tig kadlawn na ko makatulog, kung daot ko ron, mas daot pa ko sauna,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I would study until dawn and was even skinnier before.) ,\u201c,Syempre ang pamilya gyud akong inspirasyon ,(Of course, my family is my inspiration),\u201d said Arrabis, whose father is a carpenter and fisherman. His mother stays at home to look after his other siblings, the youngest of whom is 10 years old. ,Inspiration,Arrabis remembered the first time he got to the city as he entered the CTU-main campus. He saw tarpaulins of achievers and topnotchers being displayed at the gates and around the school.,\u201c,Nakapangutana ko ug kung ako naa diha pud unya, unsa kahay feeling,?\u201d (If my face appears on that tarpaulin, how would that feel like?) That was the question, he said, that guided him all throughout college.,After passing the licensure and making it to the Top 10, he said he was so happy and proud when he walked around the campus with everybody smiling and knowing him. More than that, he said his parents were proud of him.,Magna cum laude,Now working with the Department of Social Welfare and Development regional office for infrastructure projects, Arrabis is earning a basic pay of P29,000 ($654) a month since October, his first job offer. ,He now uses his earnings to continue to support his family. He also graduated magna cum laude at the CTU.,At the capitol, Arrabis got a medal, a plaque and cash incentives totaling about P50,000 ($1,127.89) in a ceremony attended by Governor Hilario Davide III and Vice Governor Agnes Magpale., ,Each college scholar of the capitol, chosen among the marginalized families in the towns, got cash incentives between P5,000-P50,000 ($112-$1,127.89) for finishing school. The amount received varies depending on the student's achievement and for passing licensure exams.,At the time, he must have felt truly proud. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/83189-cebuano-yolanda-survivor-engineers", "title": "Cebuano Yolanda survivor among top 10 civil engineers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/139042-robredo-federalism-questions,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation"},

But going further back Luneta, calls for the President\u2018s resignation were already regular column fodders. In fact, even before Aquino could clock in a hundred days in office, some quarters had already demanded his resignation.,But why such a national \"penchant\"?,Many argue that our president exercises more powers, or that he is more powerful, than US president Barack Obama, as the former virtually controls the entire bureaucracy and has a vast influence that extends to Congress and the Supreme Court.,In comparison, we know how Obama was power-checked, others say check-mated, by the Republican-dominated and largely uncooperative Lower House, when majority of its members refused to fund the federal budget which resulted in a government shutdown in late 2013. The US Lower House, in effect, not only held hostage federal funding but more glaringly handed Obama an in-your-face \u201cwe are as powerful as you are, dude\u201d statement.,To better appreciate the vast powers and influence of our president, we refer to the impeachment of former chief justice Renato Corona as its almost perfect manifestation. I say almost, because public outrage, the political interests of senator-judges (vis-\u00e0-vis the upcoming midterm elections at that time), and Corona\u2019s own undoing via his \"unguarded\" testimony, among others, were in play.,The not-so-secret presidential push and inspiration, aside from \"clear instructions\" to allies in both houses of Congress, added up to the pressure for expedited proceedings.,Yet the vast powers of the president are held together by a delicate mantle of public trust, the maintenance or erosion of which can be as fickle as the weather gets, if we go by the latest round of trust survey ratings.,Regardless of the changing public mood, however, one thing remains constant: that the power enjoyed by the incumbent is contingent on the trust the public continually bestows on the office and its occupant, but really more so on the latter. This is, at least, in theory. And this is where the problem lies.,RESIGN. Filipino students hold placards calling for the resignation of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III after he delivers his second televised address on February 6, 2015.  ,We reckon that the election of Benigno Aquino III in 2010, while phenomenal on so many levels, has not much to do with his vision for the Philippines or how his program of action could register growth beyond his term. Rather, it has more to do with sentiments of people betrayed and shortchanged by his predecessor \u2013 a people desperate in their search for a leader who personified the complete opposite of the one they were about to replace.,In sum, the people placed their trust on the one man they believe would, could, and should cure the inherited ills from the Arroyo administration. This is hardly surprising at all under our patronage-driven and personality-based politics. Thus began the reign of Aquino as superman and president.,We cannot avoid discussing presidential resignation by not examining the failures of our political institutions, as well as open the conversation on the numerous attempts by various sectors to strengthen them. The institutional failures provide perfect havens to patronage and corruption, and until we do something fundamentally difficult to destroy these lairs, we will spend the rest of our productive lives digging deeper holes than plugging the leak, so to speak.,But to say that we preserve the status quo in the absence of a leader who is of the same mold as President Aquino is utterly irresponsible, if not downright stupid, and tantamount to insulting the millions, okay the thousands, among us who are better qualified to run the affairs of State.,Our aversion and resistance to presidential resignation is not without basis. For one, our unsteady political institutions still remain prone to subjugation by power wielders who come and go every 6 years or so, and whose combined tenures, so far, have only served to undermine rather than strengthen these supposedly impersonal democratic and therefore accessible institutions.,Understandably, there are many among us whose aversion is influenced by the character of the beneficial successor. (Being an institutionalist, this is the least of my fears.) What feeds more aversion is the uncertainty of the readiness of our institutions \u2013 unsteady many of them are \u2013 to once again be subjected to another round of changes before they could find traction as they undergo rehabilitation after a long period of \"maltreatment\" by previous administrations.,To be fair to the second Aquino administration, efforts were undertaken to flesh out results of its strategy, ,Daang Matuwid,. It may be devoid of vision, but ,Daang Matuwid, rallies people around one common cause and that is reforming public institutions. Whether these efforts have degraded patronage and minimized corruption is a different story altogether.,When Pope Francis came to visit the Philippines, Facebook was flooded with posters bearing the \u201cPope Francis for President\u201d slogan, maybe simply for being such an inspiring and unifying figure to a divided people.,Well, I have a bad news for them: even if Pope Francis succeeded President Aquino by some anomaly, chances are he will also fail just the same under our system as it stands, right as you read this. There is only one way a perceived good leader can succeed in a bad system, situation, or institution: he must reform it first, if not transform it.,So while no one holds the exclusive franchise to good governance, is there someone who can or would guarantee its continuity? That was a trap question actually.,Let me rephrase that by asking rather objectively, impersonally: Can our institutions afford to absorb, adjust, and manage (with relative ease?) the constant shifting of directions and priorities from one administration to the next in such a short period without losing focus on the core deliverables?,I hope each of us can muster our own answers and find our priorities of engagement. I have found mine in the last five words in the preceding paragraph that I believe can last me well beyond 2016. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Tony D.

That is why I started up Zenith Soccer Tours, to give young kids an experience they will never forget.\u201d,Gier\u2019s program will be running football camps that will give participants a chance to stay at the world-class Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre where high caliber coaches from professional clubs in the UK will coach them.,Zenith Soccer will also take them to a tour of the different football stadiums in London to watch how top English clubs train and play., ,The culminating activity of the whole expedition will be a four-team mini tournament, one team of which will be from a professional football academy,According to the Azkals skipper, he believes the activities his program will provide will not just assist aspiring football players in improving their game but also help them become better individuals.,\u201cI want to give these youngsters some memories they will never forget.  I am a firm believer that experiences like our camp and exposure to different environments and cultures at a young age will help develop and shape these children to become more well-rounded individuals, helping to give them confidence to really express who they want to be.\u201d,The 34-year old Philippine international explained although he is still not keen on retiring, he established Zenith Soccer as a way of planning ahead for his life after football.,\u201cI am not ready to hang my boots up just yet but I am getting to the stage in my career where I need to think about life after playing.  I firmly believe in this program and it is not only a way of me staying connected with football but also a way for me to help develop the grassroots potential that our Filipino based kids have.  ,\u201cThey [kids] will ultimately be the generation on which the success of football in the Philippines depends, and if I can help in some way to make sure that football continues to grow then I will be happy.\u201d,Gier noted he is currently in contact with football academies in the Philippines with the hopes of having future partnerships with Filipino clubs to help boost the local grassroots program. ,To find out more about ,Zenith Soccer Tours, you may log onto their webite at ,www.zenith-soccertours.co.uk, or email Rob Gier at ,info@zenith-soccertours.co.uk,. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/football/83193-rob-gier-zenith-soccer-tours", "title": "Azkals' Gier launches football program in UK", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding"},

I still find it interesting that back then people said they were overwhelmed and moved to tears when he passed by. ,One believer said on social media that it felt like \",nilukuban ka ng Ispirtu Santo, (you were filled with the Holy Spirit),\" as the Argentine pontiff whizzed by in his jeepney-styled popemobile.,But when I think about the many devout Catholics of this country who cling to their faith to make things better, the thousands of typhoon victims surpassing their struggles because they believe in and draw strength from their religious beliefs, suddenly Pope Francis, his presence in Tacloban, and his many stops in Manila become more important for me. ,Apparently, regardless of my personal beliefs, his visit did matter to a lot of people. Their truth is theirs to believe in. ,The oddity of it all,It seemed odd to me when my superiors instructed us to treat our respective assignments for Pope Francis' state and pastoral visit like it was our own beat, i.e. the issues, sectors, and/or institutions we cover on a daily basis.,That meant churning out stories containing usable information to minimize foreseeable harm for the millions who would troop to the venues of his talks and sermons.,It also meant listening as much as I could to people who didn't think the way I did.,These are people whose lives circled around \u2013 and whose actions were driven by \u2013 their Catholic faith.  ,Assigned to cover ,the Pope's encounter with the youth at the University of Santo Tomas,, I talked to ,young Thomasians, about what they thought about ,this rockstar of a Pope,. ,Most of them, saw him as a symbol of hope, of love, of the brand of Catholicism their church should aspire to. ,Their truth is theirs to believe in. (READ: ,The irresponsibility of rabbits,),Global influencer,Influencers like Pope Francis generate a great deal of news. Whether they like it or not, their actions matter.,There is no doubt about Francis' tremendous reach. He has a following of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. His words are given much weight by many, and his appeal transcends religious boundaries. ,With millions heeding his call, each move he makes and word he utters could translate to the world becoming a better or alternatively a worse place. ,While I personally detest the kind of influence Pope Francis wields (seemingly coming from a system that homogenizes people's beliefs), I have no control over those who genuinely choose to believe him and the Catholic Church. ,Again, their truth is theirs to believe in. After all, such beliefs were honed mostly due to structures I and many others were born into.,This, of course, does not mean we let go of our responsibility to question. (READ: ,3 in 5 priests live in a material world,),It just means that we understand that global influence matters in a world where people's actions and daily choices are shaped by the men, women, and institutions that influence them.,Influencers are newsmakers whether they like it or not, and perhaps more importantly, whether I like it or not.,\"Be healthy,\" our editor told us when we were preparing for the papal visit. ,\"Welcome the Pope,\" she said. \"Your belief or non-belief should not get in the way of a good coverage.\" ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/buena-bernal/82375-pope-francis-coverage-non-catholic-reporter", "title": "Their truth is theirs to believe in", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/171463-nadine-lustre-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/video/reports/81246-pope-francis-to-youth-on-loving-and-receiving-love?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=referral&utm_medium=share_bar,http://www.rappler.com/specials/pope-francis-ph/81176-ust-youth-testimony-pope-francis"},

It's hard not to notice the 20-floor towers of SM Wind Residences in Tagaytay City. All photos by Pia Ranada/Rappler  ,TAGAYTAY CITY, Philippines \u2013 Back in the 1990s, Berniemack Arellano and his family would rent a bamboo and nipa cottage for around P100 ($2.3) for a view of Taal Volcano.,The Tagaytay City he remembers was like a ,probinsya, (province) \u2013 cool, relaxing, no traffic, and laid-back.,It was the perfect vacation spot for a grade one student like him from Imus, Cavite, just an hour's drive from Tagaytay. ,\"Another thing that I remember about Tagaytay was the ,bulalo, stores in Mendez Junction. I can still remember Tagaytay with its marigold blooms and wide spaces. We would head on to Palace in the Sky to get a 360-degree view of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, and, on a clear day, the glimmering skyline of Metro Manila,\" Arellano recalls.,- Professor Noel Sedigo, Cavite State University, ,Back then, the top tourist draws in the \"summer capital\" were the Picnic Grove and Taal Vista Lodge, where you could lay your ,banig, (bamboo mat) on the grass and enjoy the breeze.,But today, Arellano and his family no longer frequent Tagaytay.,He says the city \"lost its magic\" after being victimized by \"runaway tourism.\" What was once a haven for urbanites is fast resembling an urban jungle.,\"The most evident change was the rise of high-rise condominiums, buildings, and theme parks in Tagaytay. Although I am for development, this seems to be runaway tourism and lacking urban planning,\" Arellano told Rappler.,A visit to Tagaytay now yields not only a view of majestic Taal Volcano down in Batangas province but of several new high-rise buildings, including the 10 towers of SM Wind Residences, each 20 floors high; the 21-story condominium Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland; and the 9-story Robinson's Summit Ridge Hotel. There are other major commercial projects on the way. ,The Tagaytay City Planning and Development Office told Rappler there are at least two more: The District Tagaytay of AyalaLand Corporation that will open this year and Tagaytay Fora by Filinvest Corporation set to open by 2016. ,'GET AWAY.' The 21-storey Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland is being marketed as the 'perfect refuge' for urbanites ,Tagaytay Fora will be a \"mixed use\" project composed of a 10-story condotel; a commercial block with a Metro Gaisano Supermarket, department store, 4 digital cinemas, and around 300 dining and retail shops; and a forest-like garden that can be used for events. ,The District Tagaytay meanwhile will feature two 14-floor condominium buildings.,Six new condominium buildings were approved last year and will begin construction this year.,It seems development is finally coming to the ,probinsya, of Arellano's memory. But a look at scientific studies commissioned by the Cavite provincial government and a talk with scientists show that Tagaytay's vertical and urban development may spell crisis for the rest of the province.,Know your neighbors,Water is often an overlooked resource, especially for a city rising so near a lake. But water is one of Tagaytay's looming problems.,\"Tagaytay may have water today, but it will be an issue in the long run,\" Professor Noel Sedigo, chairman of Cavite State University's environment studies department, told Rappler. ,Sedigo has been tapped by the province to analyze its water situation. After looking at various studies and making some of his own, he said the picture does not look good.,MORE CONCRETE. Summer homes and concrete getaways continue to be built all over Tagaytay City  ,While Tagaytay has just enough water for its households at the moment, its current trend of vertical development and urbanization is likely to cause a water shortage in the near future.,Water is a problem for the rest of Cavite too. In fact, a 2012 study commissioned by the province shows that the province as a whole is already experiencing water shortage.,The study, conducted by energy and bulk water supply group SUWECO, concluded that the province is already short of water by around ,1,200, million liters/day (MLD). ,This is because total water demand for 2015 was pegged at 1,777 MLD while the total amount of water the province can recover from under the ground and from its springs and rivers is only 618 MLD, according to a summary of the report obtained by Rappler.,How will the province manage in 2040 when it is expected to have a water demand of 2,845 MLD?,If nothing is done, Cavite's supply of groundwater (water stored underground for thousands of years) will run out by 2019, said Sedigo.,The SUWECO study showed that the agriculture-intense towns of General Trias, Tanza, Naic, and Imus drink up most of the water for irrigating crops. This is apart from the industrial, recreational, commercial, and residential usage of water.,Thirsty Tagaytay,The shortage is already being felt. According to a 1991 study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), intense groundwater extraction (the process of pumping groundwater to water pipes) is causing groundwater levels to decrease by one meter annually. ,The province estimates that its groundwater is now 15 to 50 meters below its level in 1990. Thus, to reach the groundwater and be able to deliver it to faucets all over the province, longer and longer pipes have had to be used.,In places as elevated as Tagaytay, 3 pipes, each 25 feet long, are now used instead of just one, adding to the cost of water. Data from the province and Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) showed that water rates have been rising steadily, from P125 ($2.8) in 2000 to P233 ($5.3) in 2012. ,And what about its new high-rise buildings? Sedigo said lower groundwater means contractors will need more powerful water pumps to bring the water all the way to the highest floors. ,NEW TAGAYTAY. The Sky Ranch has become a major tourist attraction ,The TCWD, a government-owned and controlled corporation in charge of water distribution, has felt the burn.,That's why it ,entered into a contract ,with a water company in 2012 to extract water from other parts of Cavite.,In the contract, TCWD admitted the city's \"dire need of additional water resources\" due to increasing urbanization.,\"Water demand is expected to increase tremendously, even as high as double the normal demand, and upon completion and full operation of all the ongoing establishment and hotels currently being built,\" it said in the contract.,But after a petition by Cavite residents who claim the water project will deprive ,them, of water, the Court of Appeals ,ordered the water project stopped, until issues were resolved. ,Cavite's 're-charge station',Tagaytay City plays an important role in this water crisis. Though it may not be the most heavily water-consumptive of Cavite provinces, its path of development determines whether or not Cavite can survive its water woes.,The city makes up the province's upland area, an area that, due to its geographic location and elevation, functions as a re-charge station for Cavite's water supply.,\"The monsoon winds bring rain clouds to Tagaytay. Because of the high elevation, the rainwater is able to flow down slowly, giving it time to infiltrate the ground and gather beneath as groundwater,\" said Sedigo.,Because groundwater comes in trickles, it took thousands of years for the aquifer below Cavite to form and become one of its major sources of water.,VITAL WATER. This is an image of how the hydrological cycle works. Image courtesy of Noel Sedigo  ,With Tagaytay now becoming more concretized, it may take even longer to replenish that aquifer, if at all. The city is developing fast at the cost of trees which help bring rainwater underground.,The more concretized Tagaytay becomes, the less water goes to Cavite's aquifer. ,\"If I had my way, I'd keep Tagaytay forested,\" said Sedigo.,Only around 7% of Cavite is forested. Almost half, 48%, is under concrete, while the rest is agricultural land.,But at the rate Tagaytay is going, Sedigo may be hoping in vain.,Since 2011, the city's number of commercial establishments has increased by an average of 33 establishments a year, said City Planning and Development Officer IV Carlos Zuniga.,Its number of residential units, mostly constructed in existing subdivisions, has been increasing by an average of 205 units a year. The past 4 years alone have seen the rise of 20 new condominiums of various heights (1 story to 11 stories), he added.,More worrisome is Tagaytay's expansion of areas for urbanization. ,In 2009, the city amended its Zoning Ordinance to classify 4 areas as new Primary Urban Core (PUC) zones. These areas are where buildings of up to 20 stories high can be built.,URBANIZATION. The red areas are the new primary urban core zones declared by Tagaytay in 2009. (Note: This map is an edited version of a 1998 map. The map was edited by Tagaytay to reflect the 2009 zoning ordinance.) ,City Ordinance 2009-054 identifies the construction of tall buildings as its strategy for prosperity: ,Today, 3 PUC zones are occupied by the new condominiums and commercial establishments, including the Sky Ranch, a recreational area with rides and restaurants. The 4th PUC zone is yet to be developed. Tagaytay visitors know it well: it's the Picnic Grove.,Define 'sustainable' ,City planning officials defend Tagaytay's path of development.,\"We don't see yet at present that the city's urban growth threatens our environment because we provide our own measures to protect the environment and we strictly enforce the zoning ordinance,\" said Zuniga.,The amended ordinance does control what type of structures can rise in specific parts of Tagaytay. For instance, only one to two-story buildings can be constructed on the Ridge, the highest part of Tagaytay facing the Taal Volcano. ,MEMORIES. A remnant of the old Tagaytay, the Picnic Grove is managed by the city government ,To ease traffic, buildings inside a PUC zone are required to provide their own parking space and set back their building at least 5 meters from the road.,The current administration has also stopped the construction of additional subdivisions on the ridge area of the city, Planning Officer Lambert Manalo told Rappler.,To keep its water supply free from contamination, households are required to have multi-chamber septic tanks. Establishments like malls, stores, and restaurants must have their own sewerage treatment plant.,But only time will tell if these measures are enough to keep Tagaytay's development sustainable. ,Arellano and Sedigo have a different idea of sustainable. ,Arellano said, if he was in charge, he would \"promote proper zoning measures and limited urban vertical development, in order for Tagaytay to sustain its tourism and charm.\",Sedigo suggested a shift to ecotourism and \"backpacker\" tourism to keep most of the city forested. He regrets the trend of building residential units and summer houses that will lead to increased use of the limited water supply.,\"Tagaytay should be kept transient. Tourists come, take photos, and then go home.\" \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/82916-tagaytay-development-water-shortage", "title": "Tagaytay's tall buildings spell a water crisis", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61027-tagaytay-cavite-indang-water-supply,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61584-court-water-company-cavite"},
{"author": "Natashya Gutierrez", "date": "2016-02-13T09:58:29.000Z", "content": " WIDELY PRACTICED. Unicef says 200 million women and girls living today have undergone female genital mutilation. JAKARTA Indonesia When Mary was in elementary school a male classmate was circumcised. xa0 xa0He received gifts from friends as a form of congratulations prompting Mary to tell her mother when she got home I should get circumcised Mom. I can get a lot of money. Her mother s response was not what she expected. xa0 You re already circumcised her mother said. I didn t know that. When When you were a newborn. Mary recalls walking away from that conversation thinking everyone got the procedure done females at birth males perhaps when they were a little older.But it wasn t until later that Mary understood the meaning of the conversation she had with her mother.Mary is one of 200 million women worldwide who have undergone female genital mutilation FGM . The number according to a new report from UNICEF is 70 million higher than what was reported in 2014.While the top 10 countries with the highest prevalence of FGM from 2004 2015 is in Africa the data shows that the increase is partly due to population growth and new data collected in Indonesia.Indonesia with its population of 250 million people is one of 3 countries that account for half of all FGM victims in the world along with Egypt and Ethiopia.Cutting the clitorisIt was in junior high school when Mary first realized that female circumcision was not a regular practice.In conversation with her girl friends Mary learned that not everyone had undergone the procedure as a baby even if all of them were Muslim. xa0First she started to argue about how it was an obligation in their religion as she had always thought it was but becoming more curious decided to read more on the matter.She started reading books on sexual and reproductive health studying photos of vaginas. She learned about the clitoris and realized she didn t have one.Soon after she read a book about female circumcision in Arab culture including books by Moroccan feminist Fatima Mernissi which thoroughly addressed and denounced female circumcision. xa0 I read the book and learned that the practice was one of many ways to control women. One way was through circumcision she told Rappler. xa0According to UNICEF FGM includes all procedures that involve altering or injuring the female genitalia for non medical reasons. It is a practice recognized internationally as a violation of human rights of girls and women with February 6 being the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation.Even within Indonesia the practice differs in various regions. xa0Secretary General of the Women s Coalition Dian Kartika Sari said the culture of female circumcision in each region is different. xa0 xa0 There is not just one cut she told Rappler on Friday January 8.In the island of Madura for example the clitoris is cut. In other regions the feeling on the clitoris is killed by slicing off a small part but it is not completely cut off. He also said it is still practiced in some urban areas.In 2010 the Ministry of Health released a regulation that authorized certain medical professionals such as doctors midwives and nurses to perform circumcision on female patients. xa0The technical details of circumcision was even mentioned in the regulations Make a scratch on the skin that covers the front of the clitoris by using the tip of a disposable sterile needle measuring 20G 22G of the mucosa toward the skin without injuring the clitoris said article 4 paragraph 2. xa0The regulation was repealed by the Deputy Minister of Health Ali Ghufron Mukti soon after. xa0Because while FGM is widely practiced in Indonesia many others in the country do denounce FGM as a violation of rights. According to UNICEF FGM violates women s and girls right to health security and physical integrity their right to be free from torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment and their right to life when the procedure results in death. What orgasm For Mary one of the rights taken from her was her sexual rights at 33 Mary has never experienced an orgasm in her life.She was first sexually active in college and is now married. But without a clitoris Mary said she has never experienced an orgasm a feeling her friends describe as much like flying. I can never relate when they talk about it she said. It makes me sad. xa0Mary said the books she read said women find it difficult to enjoy sex without a clitoris admitting that she is unsure if her problem is psychological or physical. xa0Mary said the problem has caused stress for not just herself but for her husband who for 5 years tried various ways to help her orgasm but to no avail. She said she views sex now as just a waste of time describing her sex as mediocre. There are two main reasons parents have their daughters undergo FGM in Indonesia the first is religious as many Muslims here believe that female circumcision is an Islamic requirement or at the very least is highly recommended in Islam. This is despite the fact that no formal links between Islam and FGM exist and that no Islamic laws or Quranic verses speak of FGM let alone make it a requirement.Even Fatayat NU the women s division of Nahdlatul Ulama Indonesia s largest Islamic organization have xa0acknowledged xa0that FGM is not mentioned in the Quran and is simply a cultural product.The second reason FGM is popular in Indonesia is because it is believed to reduce women s sexual desire and libido. xa0This belief is widely held. All parents obviously want their children to live the best lives possible and for most Indonesian parents this includes no sex before marriage. In today s hypersexualized world Indonesian parents would do all they could to ensure their children are safe from the risks of seks bebas xa0or premarital sex. xa0Female genital cutting is believed by some to be one way of achieving this. Without it it is thought girls will become sexually aggressive and will actively pursue undesirable sexual relationships. Never again Previously furious at her parents who asked that doctors circumcise her and her sister upon birth Mary has since accepted her fate and the fact that the effects of FGM is something she will have to live with for the rest of her life.Mary said her parents were apologetic when she first confronted them about it saying she was born in an Islamic hospital where it was common practice. Her parents she told Rappler didn t know better.UNICEF data shows Mary s experience is not that unique. Data shows that parents are the ones who ask for circumcision for their children the most followed by religious leaders relatives and community leaders.Even today many in Indonesia think FGM is still a necessity. Sari said many community leaders still preach FGM which is one reason why the practice still exists in Indonesia. It is also still a widespread myth that FGM has health benefits.However there is no evidence that FGM affects cleanliness or vaginal health. xa0Claims that urine and genital secretions accumulate and fester in the vulva vagina or urethra have no medical backing. FGM does not reduce chances of urinary tract infections or infections of the reproductive system. Instead data shows FGM causes risks to health.Research reveals that FGM is carried out mostly on young girls between infancy and age 15.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande arrive in Moscow on February 6 to discuss with President Vladimir Putin a last minute peace initiative for Ukraine. Photo by Sergei Ilnitsky EPA MOSCOW Russia The leaders of Russia Germany and France agreed during late night talks in Moscow to draw up a plan to end fighting in Ukraine as rebels wage a deadly offensive in the country s east officials said Saturday February 7.A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than four hours of talks that wrapped up early Saturday saw the leaders agree on the drafting of a blueprint that would also include proposals from Ukraine s Petro Poroshenko. They were substantial and constructive Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters of the talks adding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande left swiftly afterward. Work is under way to prepare the text of a possible joint document to implement the Minsk agreements said Peskov referring to a widely flouted truce from September.A French official also called the talks constructive and substantial and said work was being done to pull together a document aimed at implementing the September truce.The three leaders who did not address the media after the meeting are to discuss the effort with Ukrainian President Poroshenko by telephone on Sunday February 8.The European pair s talks with the Kremlin strongman were seen an attempt to prevent the 10 month conflict in east Ukraine from spilling out of control as Washington considers whether to supply weapons to Kiev.The visit was Merkel s first to Moscow since the start of the Ukraine crisis while Hollande had made a brief stopover in December.Ahead of the talks Merkel played down hopes of a rapid end to the fighting that has claimed more than 5 300 lives since April.Merkel and Hollande first flew to Kiev on Thursday February 5 for discussions when US Secretary of State John Kerry also visited the Ukrainian capital.Kerry is set to meet Russia s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov at a security conference in Munich this weekend with the high level diplomacy seeking to resolve the worst East West crisis since the end of the Cold War. Russia cannot redraw map On Friday US Vice President Joe Biden said Ukraine was battling for survival in the face of escalating Russian military involvement. READ xa0US urges Russia to commit to ceasefire in Ukraine We the US and Europe as a whole have to stand with Ukraine at this moment Biden said in Brussels. Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe. President Putin continues to call for new peace plans as his troops roll through the Ukrainian countryside and he absolutely ignores every agreement his country has signed in the past Biden said.The West and Kiev accuse the Kremlin of sending troops and sophisticated weapons across the border to bolster separatists in Ukraine. Moscow has insisted it is not a party to the conflict.Observers have warned that if the United States gets involved militarily the regional conflict could reach a dangerous new stage and become a proxy war between Russia and the West.Russia is already under heavy Western sanctions over its alleged actions in Ukraine and European Union officials said Thursday that the bloc would blacklist more Russian individuals.The sanctions already in place along with low oil prices have dealt a blow to Russia s economy but have failed to force Putin to change tack over Ukraine.Ahead of the talks Hollande said a ceasefire should be the first step on the path to a comprehensive settlement. Kerry voiced support for what he called a helpful Franco German plan. READ xa0Putin Merkel Hollande urge Ukraine ceasefire President Putin can make the choices that could end this war he said.Evacuating civiliansRebel and Ukrainian forces on the ground agreed a ceasefire for several hours Friday around the battleground town of Debaltseve to allow civilians to leave both sides said.An Agence France Presse journalist in Debaltseve said some 25 city buses sent by both the rebels and the Kiev government left the shattered town to take civilians out although only one separatist bus was full.The sound of sporadic shelling could be heard in the distance but mortar bombardments in the town itself had halted after days of fierce fighting.Hundreds of civilians have been killed over recent weeks in east Ukraine as fighting spiralled after insurgents ignored the earlier truce deal and pushed into government held territory.One civilian and two soldiers were killed Friday and 25 wounded in fighting over the past 24 hours a government official said.
