A young child waves the national flag as crowds gather in front of the Greek parliament in Athens. Photo by Louisa Gouliamaki AFP ATHENS Greece Greece s anti austerity leaders were back in Athens Friday vowing to keep their promise to renegotiate the country s huge loans despite having little to show after a European tour aimed at winning allies to their cause. We are a sovereign country we have democracy we have a contract with our people we will honour this agreement Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told his hard left Syriza party in their first meeting Thursday since the January 25 elections.In a remarkable show of support thousands of people then gathered outside parliament standing silently in Syntagma Square the scene of violent anti austerity protests in recent years. We have nothing to lose said Stavroula Drakopoulou a 55 year old teacher. An estimated 500 people also gathered in Greece s second city Thessaloniki.Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis visited Paris London Rome Frankfurt Brussels and Berlin in the past six days to try to win over EU leaders to their plan to ease the crushing burden of Greece s debts.The tour began well but ended with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble restating his country s opposition to debt relief and expressing deep scepticism over the Greek government s proposals to restructure its EU IMF loans. We even didn t agree to disagree a downbeat Varoufakis told reporters after talks with Schaeuble in Berlin Thursday.The Greek minister will hope for a more sympathetic ear when he hosts a meeting with US Treasury deputy assistant secretary Daleep Singh later Friday.US President Barack Obama gave Athens a boost last week when he warned against squeezing debt ravaged countries such as Greece whose economy has shrunk by one quarter since 2008.Meanwhile Tsipras must prepare for his first European summit in Brussels on February 12 which will be his first meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Finance ministers from all 19 eurozone countries will gather the day before to discuss the stand off over Greece.In a sign of the pressure Athens is under to reconcile its domestic promises with its obligations to foreign lenders the announcement of the government s legislative agenda was delayed from Saturday to Sunday evening.Blows from Berlin and FrankfurtSyriza is the first anti austerity party to take power in Europe and its opening move to halt key privatisation projects spooked the markets and raised anew fears of Greece being forced out of the eurozone.The government also said it would no longer cooperate with the hated troika of auditors from the European Union European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund who are charged with enforcing the terms of Greece s 240 billion euro 275 billion bailout.Tsipras and Varoufakis later softened their tone and their creative proposals for restructuring Greece s loans were well received by many economists.But Germany viewed by many Greeks as the main obstacle on any easing of austerity remains opposed.A debt write down was not up for discussion Schaeuble said adding that he was unable to hide my scepticism... that some of the measures do not go in the right direction .Varoufakis had earlier made a comparison between Greece and Germany in the 1930s when punitive measures imposed after World War I led to the rise of the Nazis. If you humiliate a proud nation for too long... without light at the end of the tunnel then the pressure will rise in this country at some point Varoufakis said.Athens also took a blow from the ECB which announced late Wednesday that it would no longer take up junk rated Greek government bonds from the country s struggling banks.Europe s stock markets and the euro fell on the news while Greek stocks plunged more than nine percent in early trading on Thursday before recovering to close 3.37 percent down.The Athex general index opened largely stable on Friday.While the move ratcheted up the pressure Athens insisted its banks were safe as long as they still had recourse to emergency liquidity from the Frankfurt based central bank.The ECB has given the green light to make up to 60 billion euros 68.5 billion in emergency liquidity available to Greek lenders.

The player takes control of Grayson a.k.a Sir Galahad as he does The Order's will and completes his missions with either stealth or brute force.,The game's visuals are impressive. At first glance, it is hard to tell whether you are looking at a high budget animated movie or a video game. The texture and lighting are amazing and effective that we often find ourselves immersed at the game's environment and atmosphere. The Order: 1886 redefines the concept of story delivery in video games.,The transition between cinematic storytelling and actual gameplay is seamless and players will find it natural to move Grayson into action while a story event is being played out. This really helps in immersing players into the story. The game runs at 30 frames per second, ideal for achieving a cinematic feel.,The game's third-person-shooter mechanics are standard and easy to get into. The Order: 1886 favors shoot and cover gameplay similar to The Last Of Us and Uncharted.,There are other mechanics thrown in such as bullet time and quick time events. While in cover, you can initiate an attack in slow motion for better control and accuracy. This slow motion attack or bullet time event is breath taking to look at as Grayson switches stance after stance as he guns down each enemy that he sets his sights on.,There are also cinematic quick time events that require the player to press a series of buttons in succession as they are displayed while an event is unfolding in order for Grayson to successfully perform his maneuvers. In some missions, Grayson is required to move stealthily and employ his knife and hand to hand combat expertise for stealth kills.,The game unfortunately does not have a cooperative or multiplayer feature. The lack of this feature is rare for modern shooting games.,It would have been fun to play against other players using the game's armory of steampunk style guns.,The Order: 1886 is set to come out on February 20, 2015., ,Bloodborne,Along with The Order: 1886, we also got to play Bloodborne.,Bloodborne is a third-person action RPG developed by the acclaimed Japanese game developer FROM Software (Armored Core Series, Demons' Souls, Dark Souls 1 and 2). The game was made exclusively for the PS4.,The game takes place on Yharnam, a ruined city cursed with a plague that turns its citizens into monsters. The player takes on the role of the Hunter, a lone adventurer who seeks the rumored medical remedy within the city.,The city of Yharnam is breathtaking. Its design is inspired by victorian architecture and the atmosphere is dark and gothic. The houses and streets lie in a state of ruined beauty, giving these places an eerie and abandoned look. Houses have broken floorboards, cobwebs, tattered piles of books and papers, frayed tapestries, and shattered mirrors. The rooms give off a feeling of history and loneliness, as if decades had passed without any living soul setting foot in their halls. The streets are littered with piles of bricks, broken barrels, abandoned coaches, and rotting corpses.,The environment somewhat evokes scenes from Lovecraftian lore, as if HP Lovecraft himself helped in the level design. The graphics are beautiful and effective in immersing the player in the atmosphere. It's definitely a huge step forward from FROM Software's previous game, Dark Souls II.,We encountered several enemies in the game such as infected city folk and rabid monster dogs. Enemy movement is convincing and unpredictable. Encounters tend to become dangerous when you fight mobs of enemies, often resulting in the death of the player character.,This intense difficulty appears to be the selling point of the game as it rewards players who learn from their mistakes and take the time to learn the game's combat system.,Throwing pebbles at enemies to lure them one by one was a strategy we came up with after suffering several defeats.,The Hunter can equip two weapons, one in each hand. In our case, the character we used had an axe for the right hand weapon and an old firearm on the left. The firearm resembled an old flintlock pistol, just like the ones you would see on pirate movies.,Combat is challenging since it requires you to read your opponent's moves and strike when they are vulnerable. There are no shields in this game so you will need to dodge and roll to evade enemy attacks. This kind of mechanic teaches the player to be careful and avoid being over zealous when attacking.,DEMO. Sony's Arata Naito (L) talks with Rappler's Michan Lorenzo (R) as she tries out the two new games. ,We asked Naito Arata, Sony Asia Region Marketing Manager, a few questions about Bloodborne during the demo:,Rappler:, Is this game related to the Dark Souls series?,Arata:, Well it's being created by the famed company, FROM Software, but we see this game as some sort of spiritual successor to PS3's Demons' Souls.,Rappler:, Is this going to have the same brand of difficulty as the other FROM software game like Demons' Souls and Dark Souls?,Arata:, It's difficult but we don't want to describe it as a difficult game. Again, it's a challenging game but by observing the environment and the enemies you can always find out how to survive. I'm not a super gamer and my reflexes is not super good but I can survive and beat the enemies because I can understand how enemies will move.,Overall, Bloodborne promises to be a rewarding game to beat. It is set to be initially released on March 24, 2015. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/83149-the-order-1886-bloodborne-ps4-impressions", "title": "First impressions: The Order: 1886 and Bloodborne", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating"},

Dovann Arrabis said his family inspired him to study hard and make the top 10 list of the civil engineering licensure exams. Photo by Dale Israel    ,CEBU CITY, Philippines \u2013 It was the crucial last semester of his 5-year civil engineering course when Super Typhoon Yolanda left his family homeless.,Dovann Arrabis was studying in Cebu City at the time 120 kilometers away from his hometown of Daanbantayan where his family was still living at the time. It was difficult for him to be far from his family, knowing that the eye of the typhoon was nearing his town.  ,But his hard work and perseverance prevailed in spite of the devastation Yolanda caused him and his family., ,Arrabis placed 10th among all board passers nationwide who took the May 2014 Civil Engineering Licensure Examination and was one of the two students from Cebu Technological University (CTU) who made it to the top 10.,Early afternoon on February 6, the new civil engineer was among those recognized at the capitol for being a successful scholar of the Cebu provincial government. For more than 10 years, the capitol has been providing financial assistance and scholarships for the province's top high school students who want to pursue higher education.,Arrabis, who was receiving a monthly allowance of only P2,000 ($45), recalled how difficult it was to study while his family was living in tents at home.   ,\u201cPagka ugma adtong Yolanda, niuli dayun ko sa amoa kay nabalaka kaayo ko sa akong pamilya, (A day after Yolanda struck, I went home worried to check on my family),\u201d said Arrabis, who \u2013 at the time \u2013 was working on finishing his college degree in the evening, while studying for his licensure exam in the morning.,Overcoming odds, ,The eye of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) was near Daanbantayan when it made landfall in northern Cebu in November 2013. The town lost communication and many of its roads became impassable. Hundreds of families lost their homes because of the record-breaking strong winds.,Arrabis said that because of the typhoon, he stopped going to school and stopped reviewing for about two months to help his family recover.,\u201c,Naguol kaayo ko ato niuli, after duha ka buwan naka-recover rapud ko,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I was shocked when I went home. After two months, I was able to recover.) He explained that the will to improve his family's living conditions inspired him to stay focused. ,When he returned to school, Arrabis did not waste time and hit the books immediately. \u201c,Mao to nga sige lang gyud ko ug tuon, tig kadlawn na ko makatulog, kung daot ko ron, mas daot pa ko sauna,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I would study until dawn and was even skinnier before.) ,\u201c,Syempre ang pamilya gyud akong inspirasyon ,(Of course, my family is my inspiration),\u201d said Arrabis, whose father is a carpenter and fisherman. His mother stays at home to look after his other siblings, the youngest of whom is 10 years old. ,Inspiration,Arrabis remembered the first time he got to the city as he entered the CTU-main campus. He saw tarpaulins of achievers and topnotchers being displayed at the gates and around the school.,\u201c,Nakapangutana ko ug kung ako naa diha pud unya, unsa kahay feeling,?\u201d (If my face appears on that tarpaulin, how would that feel like?) That was the question, he said, that guided him all throughout college.,After passing the licensure and making it to the Top 10, he said he was so happy and proud when he walked around the campus with everybody smiling and knowing him. More than that, he said his parents were proud of him.,Magna cum laude,Now working with the Department of Social Welfare and Development regional office for infrastructure projects, Arrabis is earning a basic pay of P29,000 ($654) a month since October, his first job offer. ,He now uses his earnings to continue to support his family. He also graduated magna cum laude at the CTU.,At the capitol, Arrabis got a medal, a plaque and cash incentives totaling about P50,000 ($1,127.89) in a ceremony attended by Governor Hilario Davide III and Vice Governor Agnes Magpale., ,Each college scholar of the capitol, chosen among the marginalized families in the towns, got cash incentives between P5,000-P50,000 ($112-$1,127.89) for finishing school. The amount received varies depending on the student's achievement and for passing licensure exams.,At the time, he must have felt truly proud. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/83189-cebuano-yolanda-survivor-engineers", "title": "Cebuano Yolanda survivor among top 10 civil engineers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/139042-robredo-federalism-questions,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation"},

But going further back Luneta, calls for the President\u2018s resignation were already regular column fodders. In fact, even before Aquino could clock in a hundred days in office, some quarters had already demanded his resignation.,But why such a national \"penchant\"?,Many argue that our president exercises more powers, or that he is more powerful, than US president Barack Obama, as the former virtually controls the entire bureaucracy and has a vast influence that extends to Congress and the Supreme Court.,In comparison, we know how Obama was power-checked, others say check-mated, by the Republican-dominated and largely uncooperative Lower House, when majority of its members refused to fund the federal budget which resulted in a government shutdown in late 2013. The US Lower House, in effect, not only held hostage federal funding but more glaringly handed Obama an in-your-face \u201cwe are as powerful as you are, dude\u201d statement.,To better appreciate the vast powers and influence of our president, we refer to the impeachment of former chief justice Renato Corona as its almost perfect manifestation. I say almost, because public outrage, the political interests of senator-judges (vis-\u00e0-vis the upcoming midterm elections at that time), and Corona\u2019s own undoing via his \"unguarded\" testimony, among others, were in play.,The not-so-secret presidential push and inspiration, aside from \"clear instructions\" to allies in both houses of Congress, added up to the pressure for expedited proceedings.,Yet the vast powers of the president are held together by a delicate mantle of public trust, the maintenance or erosion of which can be as fickle as the weather gets, if we go by the latest round of trust survey ratings.,Regardless of the changing public mood, however, one thing remains constant: that the power enjoyed by the incumbent is contingent on the trust the public continually bestows on the office and its occupant, but really more so on the latter. This is, at least, in theory. And this is where the problem lies.,RESIGN. Filipino students hold placards calling for the resignation of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III after he delivers his second televised address on February 6, 2015.  ,We reckon that the election of Benigno Aquino III in 2010, while phenomenal on so many levels, has not much to do with his vision for the Philippines or how his program of action could register growth beyond his term. Rather, it has more to do with sentiments of people betrayed and shortchanged by his predecessor \u2013 a people desperate in their search for a leader who personified the complete opposite of the one they were about to replace.,In sum, the people placed their trust on the one man they believe would, could, and should cure the inherited ills from the Arroyo administration. This is hardly surprising at all under our patronage-driven and personality-based politics. Thus began the reign of Aquino as superman and president.,We cannot avoid discussing presidential resignation by not examining the failures of our political institutions, as well as open the conversation on the numerous attempts by various sectors to strengthen them. The institutional failures provide perfect havens to patronage and corruption, and until we do something fundamentally difficult to destroy these lairs, we will spend the rest of our productive lives digging deeper holes than plugging the leak, so to speak.,But to say that we preserve the status quo in the absence of a leader who is of the same mold as President Aquino is utterly irresponsible, if not downright stupid, and tantamount to insulting the millions, okay the thousands, among us who are better qualified to run the affairs of State.,Our aversion and resistance to presidential resignation is not without basis. For one, our unsteady political institutions still remain prone to subjugation by power wielders who come and go every 6 years or so, and whose combined tenures, so far, have only served to undermine rather than strengthen these supposedly impersonal democratic and therefore accessible institutions.,Understandably, there are many among us whose aversion is influenced by the character of the beneficial successor. (Being an institutionalist, this is the least of my fears.) What feeds more aversion is the uncertainty of the readiness of our institutions \u2013 unsteady many of them are \u2013 to once again be subjected to another round of changes before they could find traction as they undergo rehabilitation after a long period of \"maltreatment\" by previous administrations.,To be fair to the second Aquino administration, efforts were undertaken to flesh out results of its strategy, ,Daang Matuwid,. It may be devoid of vision, but ,Daang Matuwid, rallies people around one common cause and that is reforming public institutions. Whether these efforts have degraded patronage and minimized corruption is a different story altogether.,When Pope Francis came to visit the Philippines, Facebook was flooded with posters bearing the \u201cPope Francis for President\u201d slogan, maybe simply for being such an inspiring and unifying figure to a divided people.,Well, I have a bad news for them: even if Pope Francis succeeded President Aquino by some anomaly, chances are he will also fail just the same under our system as it stands, right as you read this. There is only one way a perceived good leader can succeed in a bad system, situation, or institution: he must reform it first, if not transform it.,So while no one holds the exclusive franchise to good governance, is there someone who can or would guarantee its continuity? That was a trap question actually.,Let me rephrase that by asking rather objectively, impersonally: Can our institutions afford to absorb, adjust, and manage (with relative ease?) the constant shifting of directions and priorities from one administration to the next in such a short period without losing focus on the core deliverables?,I hope each of us can muster our own answers and find our priorities of engagement. I have found mine in the last five words in the preceding paragraph that I believe can last me well beyond 2016. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Tony D.

That is why I started up Zenith Soccer Tours, to give young kids an experience they will never forget.\u201d,Gier\u2019s program will be running football camps that will give participants a chance to stay at the world-class Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre where high caliber coaches from professional clubs in the UK will coach them.,Zenith Soccer will also take them to a tour of the different football stadiums in London to watch how top English clubs train and play., ,The culminating activity of the whole expedition will be a four-team mini tournament, one team of which will be from a professional football academy,According to the Azkals skipper, he believes the activities his program will provide will not just assist aspiring football players in improving their game but also help them become better individuals.,\u201cI want to give these youngsters some memories they will never forget.  I am a firm believer that experiences like our camp and exposure to different environments and cultures at a young age will help develop and shape these children to become more well-rounded individuals, helping to give them confidence to really express who they want to be.\u201d,The 34-year old Philippine international explained although he is still not keen on retiring, he established Zenith Soccer as a way of planning ahead for his life after football.,\u201cI am not ready to hang my boots up just yet but I am getting to the stage in my career where I need to think about life after playing.  I firmly believe in this program and it is not only a way of me staying connected with football but also a way for me to help develop the grassroots potential that our Filipino based kids have.  ,\u201cThey [kids] will ultimately be the generation on which the success of football in the Philippines depends, and if I can help in some way to make sure that football continues to grow then I will be happy.\u201d,Gier noted he is currently in contact with football academies in the Philippines with the hopes of having future partnerships with Filipino clubs to help boost the local grassroots program. ,To find out more about ,Zenith Soccer Tours, you may log onto their webite at ,www.zenith-soccertours.co.uk, or email Rob Gier at ,info@zenith-soccertours.co.uk,. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/football/83193-rob-gier-zenith-soccer-tours", "title": "Azkals' Gier launches football program in UK", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding"},

I still find it interesting that back then people said they were overwhelmed and moved to tears when he passed by. ,One believer said on social media that it felt like \",nilukuban ka ng Ispirtu Santo, (you were filled with the Holy Spirit),\" as the Argentine pontiff whizzed by in his jeepney-styled popemobile.,But when I think about the many devout Catholics of this country who cling to their faith to make things better, the thousands of typhoon victims surpassing their struggles because they believe in and draw strength from their religious beliefs, suddenly Pope Francis, his presence in Tacloban, and his many stops in Manila become more important for me. ,Apparently, regardless of my personal beliefs, his visit did matter to a lot of people. Their truth is theirs to believe in. ,The oddity of it all,It seemed odd to me when my superiors instructed us to treat our respective assignments for Pope Francis' state and pastoral visit like it was our own beat, i.e. the issues, sectors, and/or institutions we cover on a daily basis.,That meant churning out stories containing usable information to minimize foreseeable harm for the millions who would troop to the venues of his talks and sermons.,It also meant listening as much as I could to people who didn't think the way I did.,These are people whose lives circled around \u2013 and whose actions were driven by \u2013 their Catholic faith.  ,Assigned to cover ,the Pope's encounter with the youth at the University of Santo Tomas,, I talked to ,young Thomasians, about what they thought about ,this rockstar of a Pope,. ,Most of them, saw him as a symbol of hope, of love, of the brand of Catholicism their church should aspire to. ,Their truth is theirs to believe in. (READ: ,The irresponsibility of rabbits,),Global influencer,Influencers like Pope Francis generate a great deal of news. Whether they like it or not, their actions matter.,There is no doubt about Francis' tremendous reach. He has a following of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. His words are given much weight by many, and his appeal transcends religious boundaries. ,With millions heeding his call, each move he makes and word he utters could translate to the world becoming a better or alternatively a worse place. ,While I personally detest the kind of influence Pope Francis wields (seemingly coming from a system that homogenizes people's beliefs), I have no control over those who genuinely choose to believe him and the Catholic Church. ,Again, their truth is theirs to believe in. After all, such beliefs were honed mostly due to structures I and many others were born into.,This, of course, does not mean we let go of our responsibility to question. (READ: ,3 in 5 priests live in a material world,),It just means that we understand that global influence matters in a world where people's actions and daily choices are shaped by the men, women, and institutions that influence them.,Influencers are newsmakers whether they like it or not, and perhaps more importantly, whether I like it or not.,\"Be healthy,\" our editor told us when we were preparing for the papal visit. ,\"Welcome the Pope,\" she said. \"Your belief or non-belief should not get in the way of a good coverage.\" ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/buena-bernal/82375-pope-francis-coverage-non-catholic-reporter", "title": "Their truth is theirs to believe in", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/171463-nadine-lustre-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/video/reports/81246-pope-francis-to-youth-on-loving-and-receiving-love?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=referral&utm_medium=share_bar,http://www.rappler.com/specials/pope-francis-ph/81176-ust-youth-testimony-pope-francis"},

It's hard not to notice the 20-floor towers of SM Wind Residences in Tagaytay City. All photos by Pia Ranada/Rappler  ,TAGAYTAY CITY, Philippines \u2013 Back in the 1990s, Berniemack Arellano and his family would rent a bamboo and nipa cottage for around P100 ($2.3) for a view of Taal Volcano.,The Tagaytay City he remembers was like a ,probinsya, (province) \u2013 cool, relaxing, no traffic, and laid-back.,It was the perfect vacation spot for a grade one student like him from Imus, Cavite, just an hour's drive from Tagaytay. ,\"Another thing that I remember about Tagaytay was the ,bulalo, stores in Mendez Junction. I can still remember Tagaytay with its marigold blooms and wide spaces. We would head on to Palace in the Sky to get a 360-degree view of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, and, on a clear day, the glimmering skyline of Metro Manila,\" Arellano recalls.,- Professor Noel Sedigo, Cavite State University, ,Back then, the top tourist draws in the \"summer capital\" were the Picnic Grove and Taal Vista Lodge, where you could lay your ,banig, (bamboo mat) on the grass and enjoy the breeze.,But today, Arellano and his family no longer frequent Tagaytay.,He says the city \"lost its magic\" after being victimized by \"runaway tourism.\" What was once a haven for urbanites is fast resembling an urban jungle.,\"The most evident change was the rise of high-rise condominiums, buildings, and theme parks in Tagaytay. Although I am for development, this seems to be runaway tourism and lacking urban planning,\" Arellano told Rappler.,A visit to Tagaytay now yields not only a view of majestic Taal Volcano down in Batangas province but of several new high-rise buildings, including the 10 towers of SM Wind Residences, each 20 floors high; the 21-story condominium Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland; and the 9-story Robinson's Summit Ridge Hotel. There are other major commercial projects on the way. ,The Tagaytay City Planning and Development Office told Rappler there are at least two more: The District Tagaytay of AyalaLand Corporation that will open this year and Tagaytay Fora by Filinvest Corporation set to open by 2016. ,'GET AWAY.' The 21-storey Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland is being marketed as the 'perfect refuge' for urbanites ,Tagaytay Fora will be a \"mixed use\" project composed of a 10-story condotel; a commercial block with a Metro Gaisano Supermarket, department store, 4 digital cinemas, and around 300 dining and retail shops; and a forest-like garden that can be used for events. ,The District Tagaytay meanwhile will feature two 14-floor condominium buildings.,Six new condominium buildings were approved last year and will begin construction this year.,It seems development is finally coming to the ,probinsya, of Arellano's memory. But a look at scientific studies commissioned by the Cavite provincial government and a talk with scientists show that Tagaytay's vertical and urban development may spell crisis for the rest of the province.,Know your neighbors,Water is often an overlooked resource, especially for a city rising so near a lake. But water is one of Tagaytay's looming problems.,\"Tagaytay may have water today, but it will be an issue in the long run,\" Professor Noel Sedigo, chairman of Cavite State University's environment studies department, told Rappler. ,Sedigo has been tapped by the province to analyze its water situation. After looking at various studies and making some of his own, he said the picture does not look good.,MORE CONCRETE. Summer homes and concrete getaways continue to be built all over Tagaytay City  ,While Tagaytay has just enough water for its households at the moment, its current trend of vertical development and urbanization is likely to cause a water shortage in the near future.,Water is a problem for the rest of Cavite too. In fact, a 2012 study commissioned by the province shows that the province as a whole is already experiencing water shortage.,The study, conducted by energy and bulk water supply group SUWECO, concluded that the province is already short of water by around ,1,200, million liters/day (MLD). ,This is because total water demand for 2015 was pegged at 1,777 MLD while the total amount of water the province can recover from under the ground and from its springs and rivers is only 618 MLD, according to a summary of the report obtained by Rappler.,How will the province manage in 2040 when it is expected to have a water demand of 2,845 MLD?,If nothing is done, Cavite's supply of groundwater (water stored underground for thousands of years) will run out by 2019, said Sedigo.,The SUWECO study showed that the agriculture-intense towns of General Trias, Tanza, Naic, and Imus drink up most of the water for irrigating crops. This is apart from the industrial, recreational, commercial, and residential usage of water.,Thirsty Tagaytay,The shortage is already being felt. According to a 1991 study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), intense groundwater extraction (the process of pumping groundwater to water pipes) is causing groundwater levels to decrease by one meter annually. ,The province estimates that its groundwater is now 15 to 50 meters below its level in 1990. Thus, to reach the groundwater and be able to deliver it to faucets all over the province, longer and longer pipes have had to be used.,In places as elevated as Tagaytay, 3 pipes, each 25 feet long, are now used instead of just one, adding to the cost of water. Data from the province and Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) showed that water rates have been rising steadily, from P125 ($2.8) in 2000 to P233 ($5.3) in 2012. ,And what about its new high-rise buildings? Sedigo said lower groundwater means contractors will need more powerful water pumps to bring the water all the way to the highest floors. ,NEW TAGAYTAY. The Sky Ranch has become a major tourist attraction ,The TCWD, a government-owned and controlled corporation in charge of water distribution, has felt the burn.,That's why it ,entered into a contract ,with a water company in 2012 to extract water from other parts of Cavite.,In the contract, TCWD admitted the city's \"dire need of additional water resources\" due to increasing urbanization.,\"Water demand is expected to increase tremendously, even as high as double the normal demand, and upon completion and full operation of all the ongoing establishment and hotels currently being built,\" it said in the contract.,But after a petition by Cavite residents who claim the water project will deprive ,them, of water, the Court of Appeals ,ordered the water project stopped, until issues were resolved. ,Cavite's 're-charge station',Tagaytay City plays an important role in this water crisis. Though it may not be the most heavily water-consumptive of Cavite provinces, its path of development determines whether or not Cavite can survive its water woes.,The city makes up the province's upland area, an area that, due to its geographic location and elevation, functions as a re-charge station for Cavite's water supply.,\"The monsoon winds bring rain clouds to Tagaytay. Because of the high elevation, the rainwater is able to flow down slowly, giving it time to infiltrate the ground and gather beneath as groundwater,\" said Sedigo.,Because groundwater comes in trickles, it took thousands of years for the aquifer below Cavite to form and become one of its major sources of water.,VITAL WATER. This is an image of how the hydrological cycle works. Image courtesy of Noel Sedigo  ,With Tagaytay now becoming more concretized, it may take even longer to replenish that aquifer, if at all. The city is developing fast at the cost of trees which help bring rainwater underground.,The more concretized Tagaytay becomes, the less water goes to Cavite's aquifer. ,\"If I had my way, I'd keep Tagaytay forested,\" said Sedigo.,Only around 7% of Cavite is forested. Almost half, 48%, is under concrete, while the rest is agricultural land.,But at the rate Tagaytay is going, Sedigo may be hoping in vain.,Since 2011, the city's number of commercial establishments has increased by an average of 33 establishments a year, said City Planning and Development Officer IV Carlos Zuniga.,Its number of residential units, mostly constructed in existing subdivisions, has been increasing by an average of 205 units a year. The past 4 years alone have seen the rise of 20 new condominiums of various heights (1 story to 11 stories), he added.,More worrisome is Tagaytay's expansion of areas for urbanization. ,In 2009, the city amended its Zoning Ordinance to classify 4 areas as new Primary Urban Core (PUC) zones. These areas are where buildings of up to 20 stories high can be built.,URBANIZATION. The red areas are the new primary urban core zones declared by Tagaytay in 2009. (Note: This map is an edited version of a 1998 map. The map was edited by Tagaytay to reflect the 2009 zoning ordinance.) ,City Ordinance 2009-054 identifies the construction of tall buildings as its strategy for prosperity: ,Today, 3 PUC zones are occupied by the new condominiums and commercial establishments, including the Sky Ranch, a recreational area with rides and restaurants. The 4th PUC zone is yet to be developed. Tagaytay visitors know it well: it's the Picnic Grove.,Define 'sustainable' ,City planning officials defend Tagaytay's path of development.,\"We don't see yet at present that the city's urban growth threatens our environment because we provide our own measures to protect the environment and we strictly enforce the zoning ordinance,\" said Zuniga.,The amended ordinance does control what type of structures can rise in specific parts of Tagaytay. For instance, only one to two-story buildings can be constructed on the Ridge, the highest part of Tagaytay facing the Taal Volcano. ,MEMORIES. A remnant of the old Tagaytay, the Picnic Grove is managed by the city government ,To ease traffic, buildings inside a PUC zone are required to provide their own parking space and set back their building at least 5 meters from the road.,The current administration has also stopped the construction of additional subdivisions on the ridge area of the city, Planning Officer Lambert Manalo told Rappler.,To keep its water supply free from contamination, households are required to have multi-chamber septic tanks. Establishments like malls, stores, and restaurants must have their own sewerage treatment plant.,But only time will tell if these measures are enough to keep Tagaytay's development sustainable. ,Arellano and Sedigo have a different idea of sustainable. ,Arellano said, if he was in charge, he would \"promote proper zoning measures and limited urban vertical development, in order for Tagaytay to sustain its tourism and charm.\",Sedigo suggested a shift to ecotourism and \"backpacker\" tourism to keep most of the city forested. He regrets the trend of building residential units and summer houses that will lead to increased use of the limited water supply.,\"Tagaytay should be kept transient. Tourists come, take photos, and then go home.\" \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/82916-tagaytay-development-water-shortage", "title": "Tagaytay's tall buildings spell a water crisis", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61027-tagaytay-cavite-indang-water-supply,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61584-court-water-company-cavite"},
{"author": "Natashya Gutierrez", "date": "2016-02-13T09:58:29.000Z", "content": " WIDELY PRACTICED. Unicef says 200 million women and girls living today have undergone female genital mutilation. JAKARTA Indonesia When Mary was in elementary school a male classmate was circumcised. xa0 xa0He received gifts from friends as a form of congratulations prompting Mary to tell her mother when she got home I should get circumcised Mom. I can get a lot of money. Her mother s response was not what she expected. xa0 You re already circumcised her mother said. I didn t know that. When When you were a newborn. Mary recalls walking away from that conversation thinking everyone got the procedure done females at birth males perhaps when they were a little older.But it wasn t until later that Mary understood the meaning of the conversation she had with her mother.Mary is one of 200 million women worldwide who have undergone female genital mutilation FGM . The number according to a new report from UNICEF is 70 million higher than what was reported in 2014.While the top 10 countries with the highest prevalence of FGM from 2004 2015 is in Africa the data shows that the increase is partly due to population growth and new data collected in Indonesia.Indonesia with its population of 250 million people is one of 3 countries that account for half of all FGM victims in the world along with Egypt and Ethiopia.Cutting the clitorisIt was in junior high school when Mary first realized that female circumcision was not a regular practice.In conversation with her girl friends Mary learned that not everyone had undergone the procedure as a baby even if all of them were Muslim. xa0First she started to argue about how it was an obligation in their religion as she had always thought it was but becoming more curious decided to read more on the matter.She started reading books on sexual and reproductive health studying photos of vaginas. She learned about the clitoris and realized she didn t have one.Soon after she read a book about female circumcision in Arab culture including books by Moroccan feminist Fatima Mernissi which thoroughly addressed and denounced female circumcision. xa0 I read the book and learned that the practice was one of many ways to control women. One way was through circumcision she told Rappler. xa0According to UNICEF FGM includes all procedures that involve altering or injuring the female genitalia for non medical reasons. It is a practice recognized internationally as a violation of human rights of girls and women with February 6 being the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation.Even within Indonesia the practice differs in various regions. xa0Secretary General of the Women s Coalition Dian Kartika Sari said the culture of female circumcision in each region is different. xa0 xa0 There is not just one cut she told Rappler on Friday January 8.In the island of Madura for example the clitoris is cut. In other regions the feeling on the clitoris is killed by slicing off a small part but it is not completely cut off. He also said it is still practiced in some urban areas.In 2010 the Ministry of Health released a regulation that authorized certain medical professionals such as doctors midwives and nurses to perform circumcision on female patients. xa0The technical details of circumcision was even mentioned in the regulations Make a scratch on the skin that covers the front of the clitoris by using the tip of a disposable sterile needle measuring 20G 22G of the mucosa toward the skin without injuring the clitoris said article 4 paragraph 2. xa0The regulation was repealed by the Deputy Minister of Health Ali Ghufron Mukti soon after. xa0Because while FGM is widely practiced in Indonesia many others in the country do denounce FGM as a violation of rights. According to UNICEF FGM violates women s and girls right to health security and physical integrity their right to be free from torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment and their right to life when the procedure results in death. What orgasm For Mary one of the rights taken from her was her sexual rights at 33 Mary has never experienced an orgasm in her life.She was first sexually active in college and is now married. But without a clitoris Mary said she has never experienced an orgasm a feeling her friends describe as much like flying. I can never relate when they talk about it she said. It makes me sad. xa0Mary said the books she read said women find it difficult to enjoy sex without a clitoris admitting that she is unsure if her problem is psychological or physical. xa0Mary said the problem has caused stress for not just herself but for her husband who for 5 years tried various ways to help her orgasm but to no avail. She said she views sex now as just a waste of time describing her sex as mediocre. There are two main reasons parents have their daughters undergo FGM in Indonesia the first is religious as many Muslims here believe that female circumcision is an Islamic requirement or at the very least is highly recommended in Islam. This is despite the fact that no formal links between Islam and FGM exist and that no Islamic laws or Quranic verses speak of FGM let alone make it a requirement.Even Fatayat NU the women s division of Nahdlatul Ulama Indonesia s largest Islamic organization have xa0acknowledged xa0that FGM is not mentioned in the Quran and is simply a cultural product.The second reason FGM is popular in Indonesia is because it is believed to reduce women s sexual desire and libido. xa0This belief is widely held. All parents obviously want their children to live the best lives possible and for most Indonesian parents this includes no sex before marriage. In today s hypersexualized world Indonesian parents would do all they could to ensure their children are safe from the risks of seks bebas xa0or premarital sex. xa0Female genital cutting is believed by some to be one way of achieving this. Without it it is thought girls will become sexually aggressive and will actively pursue undesirable sexual relationships. Never again Previously furious at her parents who asked that doctors circumcise her and her sister upon birth Mary has since accepted her fate and the fact that the effects of FGM is something she will have to live with for the rest of her life.Mary said her parents were apologetic when she first confronted them about it saying she was born in an Islamic hospital where it was common practice. Her parents she told Rappler didn t know better.UNICEF data shows Mary s experience is not that unique. Data shows that parents are the ones who ask for circumcision for their children the most followed by religious leaders relatives and community leaders.Even today many in Indonesia think FGM is still a necessity. Sari said many community leaders still preach FGM which is one reason why the practice still exists in Indonesia. It is also still a widespread myth that FGM has health benefits.However there is no evidence that FGM affects cleanliness or vaginal health. xa0Claims that urine and genital secretions accumulate and fester in the vulva vagina or urethra have no medical backing. FGM does not reduce chances of urinary tract infections or infections of the reproductive system. Instead data shows FGM causes risks to health.Research reveals that FGM is carried out mostly on young girls between infancy and age 15.

They were substantial and constructive Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters of the talks adding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande left swiftly afterward. Work is under way to prepare the text of a possible joint document to implement the Minsk agreements said Peskov referring to a widely flouted truce from September.A French official also called the talks constructive and substantial and said work was being done to pull together a document aimed at implementing the September truce.The three leaders who did not address the media after the meeting are to discuss the effort with Ukrainian President Poroshenko by telephone on Sunday February 8.The European pair s talks with the Kremlin strongman were seen an attempt to prevent the 10 month conflict in east Ukraine from spilling out of control as Washington considers whether to supply weapons to Kiev.The visit was Merkel s first to Moscow since the start of the Ukraine crisis while Hollande had made a brief stopover in December.Ahead of the talks Merkel played down hopes of a rapid end to the fighting that has claimed more than 5 300 lives since April.Merkel and Hollande first flew to Kiev on Thursday February 5 for discussions when US Secretary of State John Kerry also visited the Ukrainian capital.Kerry is set to meet Russia s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov at a security conference in Munich this weekend with the high level diplomacy seeking to resolve the worst East West crisis since the end of the Cold War.

Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe. President Putin continues to call for new peace plans as his troops roll through the Ukrainian countryside and he absolutely ignores every agreement his country has signed in the past Biden said.The West and Kiev accuse the Kremlin of sending troops and sophisticated weapons across the border to bolster separatists in Ukraine. Moscow has insisted it is not a party to the conflict.Observers have warned that if the United States gets involved militarily the regional conflict could reach a dangerous new stage and become a proxy war between Russia and the West.Russia is already under heavy Western sanctions over its alleged actions in Ukraine and European Union officials said Thursday that the bloc would blacklist more Russian individuals.The sanctions already in place along with low oil prices have dealt a blow to Russia s economy but have failed to force Putin to change tack over Ukraine.Ahead of the talks Hollande said a ceasefire should be the first step on the path to a comprehensive settlement. Kerry voiced support for what he called a helpful Franco German plan.

Part 3 looks at Marwan's regional and global ties to terrorism.,The information comes from classified intelligence documents obtained over a decade of research from nearly half a dozen nations and verified by at least two independent sources. ,A US-educated engineer, Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: his brother was arrested in the United States in 2007 while another brother was arrested in Indonesia in 2001. ,Marwan is wanted in Malaysia for the killing of a Christian member of Parliament in 2000, the only successful al-Qaeda linked attack in Malaysia. Marwan was also a leader of Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM, which carried out those attacks. ,A senior leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, once al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia, Marwan fled to the Philippines in 2003, according to the US, to evade a regional crackdown and is one of the last surviving members of his group. One by one, his compatriots were tracked down and neutralized by authorities: Azahari Husin, the expert Malaysian bomb maker who allegedly trained Marwan; Dulmatin, who fled to the Philippines around the same time as Marwan, killed by Indonesian authorities when he returned home; and Umar Patek, who left the Philippines and was captured in Abbottabad, Pakistan (shortly before Osama bin Laden was killed in the same city) before being extradited to prison in Indonesia.,Marwan managed to evade ,the first-ever US smart bomb attack, in the Philippines against him in 2012 in Sulu. That operation did kill his long-time host, Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail Gumbahali, better known as Doc Abu.,He also evaded a second secret special operations attempt in July 2012, after he fled to ,the marshy swamplands in Butig, Lanao del Sur,, near the Moro Islamic Liberation Front\u2019s Camp Bushra.,Another operation had been planned as early as September 2014 \u2013 perhaps the reason why suspended Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Alan Purisima remained on top in the ,January 25 Mamasapano, attack that killed 44 elite cops. Planned under his watch, these operations are extremely sensitive. (Authorities claimed the January 25 operation killed Marwan but they are awaiting confirmation through DNA tests.),Weaknesses,Many are asking why the Armed Forces of the Philippines or AFP wasn\u2019t notified earlier. ,\u201cAnyone who actually has that question fundamentally doesn\u2019t understand the inability of the AFP and the PNP to protect sensitive information,\u201d a former US Special Forces officer told me a day after news of the 44 dead operatives came out.  \u201cIf they notify anybody, that operation is done. It\u2019ll leak out, and Marwan will be gone,\u201d said the American familiar with the territory.,Anyone familiar with special forces operations knows of the often dangerous rivalry between the Philippine military and the police \u2013 a rivalry that has killed those caught in the middle and foiled numerous operations. This is part of the reason these operations are kept on a tight need-to-know basis. ,Multiply that by the organizational rivalries of their US counterparts \u2013 the CIA working with Filipino special forces operatives and the FBI working with law enforcement. Then add conflicting vested interests of local and national Filipino politicians, and you begin to get a sense of the complex brew on the side of the authorities. ,Now add the societal landscape they need to navigate: an area where law and order is weak at best \u2013 full of clan rivalries, private armed groups and overlapping family ties in the middle of a splintering Muslim insurgency, with a significant group pushing for peace and a minority spoiling for war. ,Over the last 20 years, numerous Filipino and US officials have told me there is no choice but peace because the reality is that the Philippine military and police cannot win a war. ,Now you can begin to appreciate how difficult the situation is.,3 women and an in-law,Marwan\u2019s first weapon wasn\u2019t his ideology nor the bombs he made. It was his women: at least 3 Filipino wives who cemented him into the landscape.,Although he never admitted it when he was interrogated by authorities in December 2010, his police interrogators suspected Aljebir Adzhar, alias Embel, was one of Marwan\u2019s brothers-in-law.,Embel's father was a trusted aide of Abu Sayyaf leader Doc Abu: he and his men often stayed at Embel\u2019s family home in Parang, Sulu, where Embel said Doc Abu \u201chad mass support.\u201d Over time, Embel and his brother began helping Doc Abu, first by running errands as young boys then graduating to scouting government troop movements to alert the Abu Sayyaf. This is the extended social network that made it so dangerous for the police and military to enter communities unarmed.,Embel talked about how Doc Abu gave him P70,000 to buy a brand new black Honda motorcycle with yellow stripes. That was what he used to do the weekly shopping for Marwan, who gave him P1,500 a week to buy a sack of rice, coffee and bread at Love Life Bakery in Jolo. Embel said Marwan would give him extra money to buy chicken siopao, which Marwan loved.,Embel was also the conduit for Marwan\u2019s conjugal visits, which began with Embel picking up Marwan\u2019s wife from the Jolo market. Then 17 years old, Jaida is a Yakan from Basilan.  Embel said she normally wore slacks and a shirt with long, black sleeves and carried two suitcases. She also \u201ccovered her face.\u201d ,Embel would bring her to the house of the barangay captain, where he stayed behind. Then she would walk another 30 minutes alone to the house of Embel's family, where Marwan would meet her. She would normally stay with Marwan there for about a month unless a military operation happens, in which case she\u2019d go back to the barangay captain\u2019s house.,His family didn\u2019t just support the Abu Sayyaf. Embel\u2019s sister, Kasma, is married to a member of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 1996. Over the years, though, internal fighting has often spilled out into streets in Zamboanga, most recently in 2013. Embel said his sister and her family lived in the MNLF camp in Indanan, Sulu.,At least two of the men trained by Marwan during this time were from Cotabato and \u201chad a strong alliance with the MILF (the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 2014) in central Mindanao.\u201d,Collusion,Finally, there is collusion between those who hunt and the hunted.  ,In 2009, Embel said he became close to Italian Eugenio Vagni, one of 3 members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf under Albader Parad. Embel told authorities he and his brother helped feed Parad and his men, whom Embel claimed received a ransom of P60 million for the release of their hostages, although ICRC denied it paid ransom.,That ransom, according to Embel, was negotiated and given to the Abu Sayyaf by Parad's relative, then Vice Governor Lady Ann Sahidula, who later ran for \u2013 and won \u2013 a seat in Congress.,Here's where it turns into quicksand: Embel said the kidnapping was masterminded by a jail guard whose father is a regional police intelligence officer. Part of the ransom, Embel said, was given to members of the police.,Now you begin to see how the lines blur, and why there are often many shades of truth in this land.,In part 2, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the February 2012 US smart bomb attack through the eyes of another of Marwan\u2019s brother-in-law, Ren-Ren Dongon, whose family\u2019s interwoven marriages cemented alliances between the Abu Sayyaf, the Rajah Solaiman Movement and Jemaah Islamiyah. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Part 2: ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: Ren-Ren Dongon,Part 3:  ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: From family to global terrorism,Maria A.

If you can cut through Digong\u2019s populist bluster, you will find a number of, actually not policies, more like policy thrusts.    ,Leni Robredo is the perfect antithesis of Duterte\u2019s misogyny, his hatred of women. Where Duterte is a loud braggart, Leni is ,tranquilo, \u2013 a few words, a shy smile and she gets her point across. Her victory is as amazing as Duterte\u2019s. It\u2019s hard to imagine that they both come out of the same pit of resentment and anger where many of our people live their lives day in, day out.,This was more than an election that picked our leaders. It is a warning to all our leaders, winners and losers alike, that things cannot remain as they are. Mar Roxas is the best president we never had. He had the misfortune of being perceived as representing the way things are, more than ,daang matuwid,, the kind of society where the more the economy grows, the more frustrated the poor become.,To be fair, more has been done for the poor under the Aquino administration than at any time under any one regime, even the last 4 of them taken together. The problem is that PNoy\u2019s personality, Mar\u2019s for that matter \u2013 their way of doing things, made it difficult for them to ,reach, the poor even as they accumulated projects and programs for them. They resisted, would not even know the first thing about, ,populism,.,I do not know if Duterte is a conscious populist. His oversized personality, his self-absorption makes him a perfect populist. On one side of his macho personality, his preoccupation with women, on the other, not unrelated, with violence. It is the people\u2019s fear for their personal safety that Digong is responding to. A populist is not accountable. All he has to do is (re)present in his words and actions the people\u2019s fears, anger, and hopes. A President Rodrigo Duterte, however, is accountable.,Unsaon pod lamang,In Siquijor, we say ,unsaon pod lamang,, accept what we cannot reverse, make the best of it. If you can cut through Digong\u2019s populist bluster, you will find a number of, actually not policies, more like policy thrusts. These are not necessarily implementable, but could set things into motion. Take his constant refrain, drug lords and police who protect them, beware. It would be nice if drug lords actually got scared and stopped operating. More likely, small time dealers and their teenage runners will get targeted.,It\u2019s not as if police are new to extrajudicial killings. They cannot be blamed if they believe that the statements of Duterte have given them ,carte blanche, to kill as many drug lords as they can. Outside of police killings, vigilante groups, often out of uniform police, will have even less restrictions. The problem for Duterte is that he does not have the kind of control over the national situation as he had in Davao City.,There are more doable things in police reform. Because police were ill-equipped and poorly paid, the Philippine National Police (PNP) for many became a platform for sharing profits with criminals. But much has already been done in police reform. The PNP is a more professional agency. Its image has moved beyond the potbellied policeman. Digong can consolidate these gains by following through on raising police salaries, and identifying those 3 corrupt police generals he talked about.,INCOMING PRESIDENT. Rodrigo Duterte in 'Malaca\u00f1ang of the South', DPWH Depot Compound, Panacan, Davao City. File photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler ,If the Duterte administration achieves nothing else except conclude a political settlement with the National Democratic Front (NDF), it will have made a major contribution. Duterte\u2019s experience in crafting a \u201cworking arrangement\u201d with the Davao City NPA, and his appointment of NDF nominees to Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions, have created better political conditions for peace talks than in the preceding administrations. All indications are that Joma Sison is anxious to conclude talks that will enable him to return from exile.,Whether Sison can get the local NPA to agree is another matter. If Benny and Wilma Tiamzon, who are not as enthusiastic about peace talks as Sison, are released, will they go along at the pace that Sison wants? A ceasefire should be relatively easy, but what \u201ccantonment\u201d means, will local NPA agree to remain in identified camps, is going to be difficult. The situation in Caraga, where Duterte wants an end to illegal mining, provides an example of difficulties. Can Duterte and Sison persuade the military and the NPA who protect illegal mining to forego their millions in protection money?,I do not understand what considerations underlie Duterte and his people\u2019s seeming hesitation on finalizing political settlement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front by pushing for the passage of the BBL. Waiting for constitutional amendments shifting the government from unitary to federal will take many years, and will not address the historical injustices to the Moro people. It\u2019s also curious that neither Digong nor his people have said much about Mindanao development. Surely it\u2019s not enough to stick a dirty finger at Imperial Manila.,While waiting for constitutional reform, there are many things that the Duterte administration can do to transfer more power and resources to local governments. They can retain Bottom-up Budgeting (BuB) for a start. Cutting it as Cabinet designate Ben Diokno reportedly suggests would risk the opposition of mayors. Poverty can be added to the formula for Internal Revenue Allotments (IRA). The long delayed review of the Local Government Code can be organized even as the more radical federalism proposal is being discussed.,There are many reforms that Digong and his people have supported, from FOI to mining to K+12. His economic team \u2013 Sonny Dominguez, Ernie Pernia and Ben Diokno \u2013 is strong and will likely continue the economic reforms of the PNoy administration. What people worry about is the volatility of Duterte\u2019s rhetoric. It\u2019s not just his cussing, it\u2019s also how Duterte will navigate the demands of his allies on the Left and the Right. We can always hope for the best. In Siquijor, we go from ,unsaon pod lamang, to hope, ,bason pod lamang.,Leni can help. With characteristic generosity, she says Duterte can expect 100% support. It may be best that she will not be in the Cabinet where she will be expected to provide undifferentiated support. From outside the Cabinet, but with the authority of her mandate as number two, she can provide critical collaboration, or if necessary, an alternative. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Joel Rocamora is a political analyst and a seasoned civil society leader who has been working on issues of democracy, governance, and social movements for several decades.

So he really had no choice but to make a play, and he did.\",Smith finished with 21 points off the bench once more to go with 9 rebounds and two assists.,The import's last play does not, however, overshadow ,Pogoy's statement game in his first finals appearance. The rookie buried 5 3-pointers, including one that gave TNT a 10-point cushion halfway through the fourth. He was a huge problem for the Beermen, who came out flat to start the series and failed to find a rhythm amid the KaTropa's pesky defense.,Castro also had his own big moment, coming up with a clutch 3-pointer that put the KaTropa up 102-99 with 44.2 seconds left. Castro was a rebound shy of a triple-double with 14 points, 10 assists, and 9 rebounds., ,Troy Rosario was another finals first-timer who did not balk under the all-new atmosphere and pressure on his way to scoring 10 points and grabbing 6 rebounds, plus plenty of hustle plays.,TNT capitalized on the cold-shooting San Miguel, who shot 6-of-29 from deep, and let its defense dictate the game from the start. They forced the Beermen to 13 first half turnovers and picked up 19 big points off of that, while San Miguel had only 6 points off of TNT's 8 turnovers.,SMB's total turnovers rose to 23 and they gave up 27 points by the end of it.,Charles Rhodes had a highlight 21-point opening quarter but was scoreless for the next two quarters before finishing up with 31 on top of 13 rebounds, and 4 assists. He battled foul trouble and turned the ball over 6 times.,June Mar Fajardo put up 18 points and 13 rebounds, while Alex Cabagnot added 16 points. Chris Ross and Arwind Santos combined for 22 markers as the Beermen's shallow bench came back to haunt them in Game 1.,TNT's deep bench, which is the team's edge against the championship-tested San Miguel, outscored the Beermen's by 46-18. Although Smith accounted for 21 of those.,Game 2 of this series is on Friday, June 23. ,Scores,: ,TNT (104),: Pogoy 27, Smith 21, Castro 14, Garcia 13, Rosario 10, Tautuaa 7, Semerad 5, Williams 5, Rosales 2, Golla 0, Carey 0, Nuyles 0. ,San Miguel (102),: Rhodes 31, Fajardo 18, Cabagnot 16, Ross 11, Santos 11, Lassiter 8, De Ocampo 6, Espinas 1, Tubid 0. ,Quarter scores,: 24-31, 56-51, 75-73, 104-102.,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/173625-josh-smith-rr-pogoy-tnt-seizes-game-1-smb", "title": "Smith hits winner, rookie Pogoy shines as TNT seizes Game 1 vs SMB", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/174317-rumors-pacquiao-decline-greatly-exaggerated,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked"},

The Court of Appeals issues a Writ of Kalikasan against a water company accused of building a dam that will deliver water from 4 rivers to Tagaytay City alone to the prejudice of other Cavite local governments. Photo from Drumlanrig from Wikimedia Commons,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Court of Appeals, through a Writ of Kalikasan, has ordered water company PTK2 H2O to stop extracting water from 4 rivers in Cavite. It also instructs the company to stop its construction of a dam and water delivery pipes in Indang town. (READ: ,Tagaytay tourism taking water away from Cavite residents?,),The Writ, issued on June 23, was sent to respondents PTK2 H2O, National Water and Resources Board (NWRB), Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) and Department of Environment and Natural Resources Region (DENR) Region IV.,The Writ, obtained by Rappler, orders them to \"cease and desist, pending resolution of this petition, from extracting water from the Ikloy, Indang, Lambak and Saluysoy rivers, from excavating, cutting trees and/or undertaking related construction works, and from implementing and/or executing any and all acts in furtherance of the alleged contracts and activities.\",The respondents were also ordered  to respond to the Writ within a \"non-extendible\" period of 10 days after receiving the document.,A Writ of Kalikasan is a legal remedy designed to protect a Filipino citizen's right to environmental protection. It may be used by any individual or group as protection from environmental damage that threatens the life, health and property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.,The order, issued by Presiding Justice Andres Reyes and Justices Manuel Barrios and Pedro Corales, was in response to a petition for Writ of Kalikasan with Prayer for Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) by Save the Water in Indang (SWIM), a group of concerned Cavite residents and environmental advocates.,The judges found the petition, submitted on June 18, \"sufficient in form and substance.\",Threatened water supply,SWIM accused PTK2 H2O of beginning a construction project that could threaten the water supply of Cavite province.,Documents showed that the water company had signed a deal with the TCWD to provide 50,000 cubic meters of water a day from the rivers. To fulfill their end of the bargain, PTK2 H2O has begun constructing water extraction facilities like a mini dam and pumping stations.,But scientific papers cited by the petition showed how this amount of water would bleed the rivers dry in a few years time. This could lead to water shortage for the 12 cities and municipalities who depend on the rivers.,The NWRB and DENR Region IV are blamed for greenlighting the project despite such studies and despite the lack of a proper environmental impact assessment.,But NWRB Executive Director Sevillo David Jr told Rappler that an Environmental Compliance Certificate is unnecessary for this type of project. He also gave assurances that the NWRB conducted their own study on Cavite's water supply and concluded that the PTK2 H2O project would not endanger it.,According to TCWD, they sought the services of PTK2 H2O because of the water crisis facing Tagaytay City once the commercial establishments and hotels currently being built are completed in a few years.,Tagaytay City is one of the most popular tourism destinations in Luzon because of its cool climate, proximity to Metro Manila and view of the majestic Taal Volcano. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61584-court-water-company-cavite", "title": "Court to water company: Stop extracting from Cavite rivers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/business/168878-roberto-lim-dotr-undersecretary-aviation-resigns,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61027-tagaytay-cavite-indang-water-supply"},

But the people behind the movie, including director Sam Taylor-Johnson and writer EL James, have said that they've taken great care to preserve the book's appeal \u2013 and meet fans' expectations. , ,Here are what some of the critics are saying. In general, reviews praised the glossy look and performances from the leads, while commenting on how the movie holds back when it comes to the more explicit scenes.,Sheri Linden, ,The Hollywood Reporter, ,Writing for ,The Hollywood Reporter,, Sheri Linden said that the movie's strength over the book is how the movie isn't hampered by the book's long descriptions, though the review does say that the screenplay does retain many of the book's memorable lines. ,Linden also praises the performances from both leads, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson.,Screengrab from YouTube ,Commenting on the sexually charged scenes, she said: \", The penultimate scene, where Christian punishes Anastasia with a belt \u2014 and thrills to it, as Dornan communicates with exquisite subtlety \u2014 is by far the film\u2019s most extreme.\",Lisa Schwarzbaum, ,Entertainment Weekly,EW ,also praised the stars' performances, particularly Dakota as Ana Steele, while pointing out that the film employs a sort of \"look-but-don't-pant\" tone throughout the film. ,\"...,the movie version appears to be aimed at a younger consumer crowd than -the readers (albeit a crowd qualified for R-rated entertainment). In any event, the result is confounding, leaving both those coming to the ,Fifty Shades, phenomenon for the first time as well as those who have read the book to wonder, for different reasons, Where\u2019s the beef?\",Screengrab from YouTube ,Elizabeth Weitzman, ,New York Daily News,Dakota is getting much acclaim for her role \u2013 she's consistently praised over several critics' reviews. ,\"[Jaime] Dornan, unfortunately, never evolves into anything more than a pretty face. But Johnson is a true find: She's so committed, she makes Ana's every discovery \u2014 in or out of the bedroom \u2014 convincing...,She's smarter and sassier than her literary counterpart, while Christian, thank goodness, is less creepy-stalkerish.\" ,Screengrab from YouTube ,This review also points out one thing which many readers might be happy about: the film does away with Ana's references to her \"inner goddess,\" which delights whenever Christian does something she finds particularly arousing, or whenever her character wants to convey a sudden turn in emotion. ,Justin Chang, ,Variety,Almost across the board, most of the critics remarked that the film gets a chance to do away with some elements that didn't work as well in the book, including its dialogues.,Photo courtesy of Columbia Pictures/United International Pictures , ,\"If the problem with too many literary adaptations is a failure to capture the author\u2019s voice, then that shortcoming turns out to be the single greatest virtue of ,Fifty Shades of Grey...\",\"In that respect, there\u2019s something at once underwhelming and almost heartening about the sleek, professional softcore spectacle of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d which substitutes a genteel visual shorthand for James\u2019 hot-and-heavy descriptions, duly cushioned by the rhythmic thrusts and heaves of Danny Elfman\u2019s score,\" continues the review. , ,Finally, here's a bonus from one celebrity who's seen the film: ,Kim Kardashian-West,, reality TV star, ,Will you be watching?

This poses a new challenge to the peace process.    ,MANILA, Philippines - Classified documents and maps obtained by Rappler show the terrorist targets of ,the first smart bomb attack, in the Philippines early this year are still alive and have now found sanctuary in central Mindanao, in a territory controlled by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). ,This poses a new challenge to the peace process between the government and the MILF. Both sides resumed their talks Tuesday, July 17.,The two most senior Jemaah Islamiyah or JI leaders in the Philippines are Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, who carries a US$5-M reward on his head, and Singaporean Mohammad Abdullah Ali, known as Muawiyah, who has a $500,000 reward for his capture or kill. ,Civilian and military intelligence sources from the Phiippines, Malaysia and the United States confirmed to Rappler that the two escaped the joint Phiippine-US smart bomb operation on Feb 2, 2012, which killed their long-time host, Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail Gumbahali, better known as Doc Abu. ,They are now in Butig, Lanao del Sur, near the MILF's Camp Bushra, seen clearly in satellite maps obtained by Rappler and verified by Philippine and US intelligence sources. ,Despite this, the Philippine military continues to insist that the two were killed in the February attack.,When asked by Rappler about the alleged presence of the two JI leaders in MILF territory, Mohagher Iqbal, head of the MILF panel holding peace talks with the government, said: \"The MILF also received that report... but our AHJAG is validating this on the ground.\",TALKING PEACE. MILF chief peace negotiator Mohaguer Iqbal. File photo,From Sulu to Lanao,According to classified Philippine intelligence reports, Marwan and Muawiyah were sheltered in Sulu for nearly two weeks by an Abu Sayyaf member belonging to the group of Radullan Sahiron, the most senior leader of the Abu Sayyaf today. Sahiron allegedly blamed the two for the death of Doc Abu, Sahiron\u2019s close friend. Their two groups often worked together against the military and in kidnap-for-ransom cases. ,\u201cThese two men were not in the kill zone,\u201d said Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore. \u201cIn the battlefield, such confusions can always take place, but today, the Philippine military is much more capable than what it was.  It\u2019s only a question of time that Muawiyah and Marwan will be either captured or killed.\u201d,The documents say Marwan and Muawiyah fled Patikul, Sulu, as early as February 27 after Sahiron and his cousin, MNLF commander Tahil Sali, pushed them out of the area. They were allegedly picked up by another Abu Sayyaf leader, Isnilon Hapilon, and travelled by boat to an area in Butig, Lanao del Sur, near the MILF\u2019s Camp Bushra.,Intelligence sources in Singapore and the Philippines told Rappler Muawiyah has called family members in Singapore since then. ,Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: one brother was arrested in Indonesia for a failed bomb plot; the other brother was arrested in the United States. Marwan is also wanted in Malaysia for the killing of a Christian member of Parliament in 2000, the only successful al-Qaeda linked attack in Malaysia. Marwan is also a leader of Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM, which carried out those attacks.,Filipino intelligence sources also told Rappler that the two men are travelling with pregnant Filipino women, believed to be their wives.,MILF and peace talks,Their area of refuge now becomes tricky because the MILF is in the middle of peace talks with the Philippine government. Chief government negotiator Marvic Leonen says he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the two sides will reach an agreement this year. ,\u201cIn 2006, the MILF committed actually to assist government and interdict lawless elements, and this is via an Ad Hoc Action Group (AHJAG),\u201d said Leonen in a recent interview on #TalkThursday. \u201cThe government has turned over to the MILF a list of its high-value targets (HVTs), and we hope that the MILF soon enough will keep to their commitments in 2006.\u201d,Both Leonen and Iqbal pointed out that AHJAG has helped resolve incidents of kidnapping, without ransom paid, and is part of the reason open conflict has been minimized this year.,Chief government negotiator Marvic Leonen,The difficulty is that the MILF also gave JI sanctuary from the mid-90's until 2005, when the MILF Central Command threw them out, along with the Abu Sayyaf and the Rajah Solaiman Movement. That was when JI members fled to Sulu.,\u201cIt\u2019s a reality that many of those that are lawless do have relatives within communities where MILF may be influential or dominant, and therefore, it may be natural that in some instances, they would come home and seek succor under their protection,\u201d added Leonen.,Marwan and Muawiyah pose a new challenge to the peace process. \"They are the two most important foreign terrorists currently operating in Southeast Asia,\" said Gunaratna. \"They are the two most important foreign international terrorists operating in the Philippines.\" -, Rappler.com, , , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/8719-jemaah-islamiyah-leaders-in-central-mindanao-classified-documents-amp-maps", "title": "2 JI leaders now in MILF territory - reports", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159568-isis-direct-contact-isnilon-hapilon,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/ph-travel/131325-mt-hamiguitan-unesco-world-heritage-site-philippines-natural-science-museum,http://www.rappler.com/nation/2910-us-smart-bombs-used-in-sulu-attack"},

It is equipped with high resolution, day and night camera and thermal imager. ,In the early morning hours of February 2, a ,Scan Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), showed a joint team of US and Filipino soldiers a live feed of what was happening on the ground inside the camp of a senior Abu Sayyaf leader in Parang, Sulu. ,They watched the thermal image of their \"military asset\" - a double agent - and compared what he was texting them with the images they were watching. The asset texted the location and pattern of movements of the people around him \u2013 information the soldiers verified through the thermal images they saw. When he texted that he was leaving the camp, the soldiers watched his thermal image walk away.,Scan eagles, also known as drones, have been operating in the Philippines for many years now.,Although originally flown from US navy ships and operated by civilian contractors, there are smaller drones operated by US special forces. Don\u2019t mistake these for the Predator drones and Global Hawks carrying hell fire missiles that killed Al-Qaeda and other terrorist targets in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ,In the Philippines, drones are used only for surveillance. ,This was confirmed by ,Philippine President Benigno Aquino III on Tuesday, largely because a drone strike handled by the Americans may violate the Philippine Constitution. US troops, Mr Aquino said, \u201care here as advisers. They are here as trainers. They cannot participate in combat operations.\u201d,Which is exactly what they have been doing. ,The US military arrived in the Philippines in February 2002, dubbed the second front in its \u201cwar against terrorism.\u201d At its peak, US troops reached 1,200, including 660 US special forces.,The military alliance also includes technology transfer.  ,In mid-2010, Washington pledged ,$18.4 million of precision-guided missiles, funded under a US Congressional Act, which allowed its defense department to train and equip foreign military allies.,A classified document from the Philippines is explicit: \"Fiscal year 2010 assistance for the Philippines provides a precision-guided missile capability to assist Philippine Armed Forces' counter-terrorism efforts in southern regions to combat the activities of the Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf Group.\",November arrival,The first smart bombs, PGMs or Precision-Guided Munitions kits, arrived in the Philippines on November 1, 2010. ,According to a technical timeline obtained by Rappler, Philippine Air Force pilots sat down with subject matter experts to lay out a training plan in December. ,Weapons training began the following year, on Jan 24, 2011.,Two months later, aircraft installation & training started, leading to test drops which were scheduled to begin in May of the same year. ,On June 20, 2011, the US delivered at least 22 more PGM kits to the Philippine military. ,During this period, US defense contractor Raytheon, the company which makes the PGMs, visited the Philippines 3 times, according to the documents.,Finally, on Feb 2, 2012, after nearly 8 months of training, the Philippines deployed its first smart bombs. ,Target: JI in Sulu,The targets had long been under surveillance: the 2 most senior Jemaah Islamiyah or JI leaders in the Philippines sheltered by Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail, better known as Doc Abu. ,They are Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, who carried a $5-M reward on his head from the US government, and Singaporean Mohammed Abdullah Ali, known as Muawiyah, who had a $500,000 reward for his capture or death.,\u201cThere was a target that was of high enough value with actionable intelligence and the right conditions that would warrant its use,\u201d said a military source privy to the operations. \u201cThese are expensive devices so they are used for the right targets at the right time.\u201d,There was a long, involved process to get to this point, governed by protocols set by both nations, according to documents obtained by Rappler.,The Philippines and the US followed 2 levels of clearance and parallel approval processes.,First, ground commanders from both nations identify a target. For the Americans, its Joint-Special Operations Task Force-Philippines (JSOTF-P) then coordinates with the US Embassy before getting approval from SOCPAC, the Special Operations Command, Pacific in Hawaii.  ,After SOCPAC approves, it alerts the US Pacific Command (PACOM). Then it goes back to JSOTF-P which then notifies its Philippine counterpart of concurrence for the target.  ,On the Philippine side, the commander of the Joint Task Force Comet (Sulu's military unit) coordinates with the Western Mindanao Command (WESTMINCOM) and when US concurrence happens, WESTMINCOM approves the target and authorizes execution by Filipino troops.,BLAST SITE. Sitio Lanao Bato, Sulu. Picture taken at 12:12pm on February 2, 2012,Between 2 and 3 am on February 2, Philippine Air Force OV-10 Broncos dropped the 227 kg (500 lb) bombs in the strike zone in a remote village in Parang, Sulu, demolishing much of the area. ,In the dark,The first signal that new technology was used was the choice of when to drop the bombs.,In the past, planes could only drop their payload during daylight because pilots used visual cues.  ,Now the smart bombs can strike in the dark because they are guided by GPS or a homing device.,About 45 minutes after the bombing, the military asset texted his handlers that he would check \u201cthe targets.\u201d  ,Sources said they watched a thermal image move back to the area. His text said that Doc Abu had been \u201cobliterated.\u201d  Marwan was allegedly \u201ccut in half from the waist,\u201d while Muawiyah was barely breathing with blood gushing out of a deep neck wound.,Based on that, the Philippine military ,announced, the deaths of these key leaders.,Wrong info,But it now appears that the asset was wrong about Marwan and Muawiyah. ,Civilian and military intelligence reports from at least 3 countries show, both JI leaders are still alive,. ,Last week, Malaysia's chief counterterrorism official Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said Marwan was still alive. ,Philippine military spokesman Col Arnulfo Marcelo Burgos maintained his position the JI leaders are dead and said Malaysia should provide \"conclusive proof of life.\" ,On the use of smart bombs, there are conflicting responses from the Philippines. ,Col. Burgos, based in Manila, said the military, \"neither confirms nor denies the existence of such munitions citing operational security reasons. However, its pilots have been training vigorously to further improve their proficiency particularly in the precise delivery of munitions to its identified target.\",Col Jose Cenabre, the head of Sulu's Task Force Comet, categorically denied the use of smart bombs: \"I strongly deny that. That's just talk. We did not use them.\",However, Lt Col Miguel Ernesto Okol, spokesman of the Philippine Air Force, told Rappler: \u201cOur pilots\u2019 accuracy in the past was not good. They were not adept, but now with considerable time training and through the advice of our allies, particularly the US military, we are able to increase the accuracy of our pilots to 80 to 90%.\u201d - ,with reports from David Santos/Rappler.com, ,Maria Ressa, ,is the author of ,Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of Al-Qaeda's Newest Center of Operations in Southeast Asia ,(Free Press, 2003).

Improving agriculture in the Philippines can push for inclusive growth. File photo by Fritzie Rodriguez/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 One would expect a booming agricultural sector in a country rich with vast fertile lands, but this seems to be not the case in the Philippines.,According former budget secretary Benjamin Diokno, the government should focus on the agricultural sector which employs a third of the labor force. (READ: ,PH agriculture: Why is it important?,),\"It is cheaper to create jobs in agriculture than in other sectors,\" he told Rappler.,In addition, pushing for the sector's development will lead to ,inclusive growth,, especially as agricultural workers are the poorest in the labor sector. (READ: ,The state of agriculture, fisheries under Aquino,),\"Agricultural growth in the last 5 years was anemic,\" Diokno stressed. \"If you pay attention to agriculture in the rural area, that's growth inclusive.\",Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority show that there is no significant change in poverty incidence among farmers.,What can be done,In a forum organized by Greenpeace Philippines, Nheden Sarne of the Agricultural Commodities Division of the National Economic and Development Authority said there are a lot more improvements needed before the country\u2019s agricultural sector achieves its full potential.,While the bulk of the programs of the Department of Agriculture (DA) are commodity-centric, Sarne suggested that it would be better if policies and projects will also focus on priority areas that can boost the stability of the sector.,1. Encourage investments in agriculture that promote area-based development,By ensuring that each area in the Philippines is prioritized through specific development programs, there will no longer be a problem of getting left behind. Each aspect will be tapped, leading to inclusive agricultural growth and eventually, economic growth.,2. Prioritize investments that can increase and sustain productivity,If the productivity of those working on the agricultural sector is developed, a lot of opportunities will open that can ensure growth. However, productivity enhancement should not only be on one or two aspects \u2013 it should cover the entire supply chain from production to marketing.,3. Ensure well-functioning irrigation systems and an efficient transport infrastructure,Irrigation systems have been a constant problem of the average Filipino farmer. If investments in a developed irrigation system is prioritized, it will make a huge difference.,Underscoring its important Sarne, noted that an improved irrigation system in any part of the Philippines can increase productivity by 15% to 20%.,4. Invest in programs that will increase resilience to climate risks and disasters, as well as pests and diseases,Farmers used to just face off with pests and diseases, and periodic typhoons, but as years passed by, climate change has contributed to the burden that hinders growth in the sector.(READ: ,How climate change harms the ASEAN food basket,),According to DA, farmers are the most affected by typhoons and other effects of climate change. Rehabilitation also takes time so developing resiliency is best.,Farmers should be taught on the various ways they can mitigate and  reduce climate risks. If possible, climate-resilient crops should be made available. (READ: ,Empowering farmers against climate change,),5. Promote greater private sector investments and support,Connection with the private sector can be made through agri-business schemes such as contract farming.,The ,Food and Agriculture Organization, (FAO) defines contract farming as \"agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between a buyer and farmers.\" Conditions then are set between the two parties regarding certain aspects such as quantity of crops to be produced.,The FAO added that both farmers and private institutions can benefit from contract farming.The farmers are guaranteed buyers of a specific quantity of their crops. Meanwhile, the private institution will then have adequate supply at agreed-upon price. ,Reforms needed,Beyond programs that aim to uplift the current situation, Sarne suggested revisiting certain agriculture-related policies revisited to test their effectiveness. If proven to be ineffective, these should be reconsidered or at least, revised.,One of these laws include Republic Act 8178, or the Agricultural Tariffication Act.,\u201c,Dapat may, close monitoring, na maayos pagdating sa, importation, ng ,agricultural products,\u201d Sarne stressed. \u201c,Hindi iyong, import, lang nang, import;, dapat maayos ang proseso rin.,\u201d,(There should be close monitoring when it comes to importation of agricultural products. there should be a proper process, not just always importing.),In addition to land and water reforms, Sarne also encouraged reforms at the National Food Authority.,He said the NFA should maximize the productivity of the local farmers by increasing domestic palay procurement. The NFA\u2019s role should also cover buffer stocking or ensuring a vast supply of rice.,Prioritize farmers,At the end of the day, the welfare of farmers should be kept in mind when implementing agriculture programs and projects. They are, after all, the country's main food producers.,\u201c,Ang mas importante siguro na sa hanay ng mga ,farmers, ay ma-diversify at increase ang kanilang sweldo,,\u201d Sarne said. \u201c,Sobrang maliit po ang sweldo para masustentuhan ang pangangailangan ng isang pamilya na pagsasaka lamang ang kabuhayan.,\u201d,(What\u2019s more important is that we increase and diversify the income of farmers. Their income is very small and definitely makes it hard for a farming family to make ends meet.),Being a country with rice as a staple, we cannot afford to lose our farmers. Their unproductivity can lead to a problem of food insecurity.,\u201c,May magugutom talaga kapag di masigla ang ,agriculture, mo, (There will really be hungry people if the agricultural sector is weak),\" Diokno stressed. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/102624-improvements-philippine-agriculture", "title": "How can the Philippines have a booming agricultural sector?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/97025-real-problem-political-families,http://www.rappler.com/brandrap/brighter-life/102988-realizations-financial-planning,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/59228-philippine-oceans-crisis-small-fisherfolk,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/52372-agriculture-hunger-food-security,http://www.rappler.com/business/economy-watch/66204-agriculture-inclusive-growth"},

Right now, martial law is implemented not in the fashion of 1972, but in accordance with the spirit of the 1987 Constitution,\" said Padilla.,The 1987 Constitution, crafted after the ouster of Marcos, ,specifies that a state of martial law cannot override the functions of the judicial and legislative branches of government.,The 1987 Constitution also does not \"authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function.\",A state of martial law does not automatically suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.,Its suspension shall only apply to \"persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with the invasion.\",During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, those arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within 3 days, or otherwise released., \u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/171522-martial-law-continue-after-marawi-siege", "title": "Martial law may continue after Marawi siege \u2013 AFP", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario"},

The Philippines can better address its food security and nutrition issues if the agriculture sector is further improved. Photo by Jay Directo/AFP,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Better nutrition begins with improving agriculture, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ,\u201cThe traditional role of agriculture in producing food and generating income is fundamental, but agriculture and the entire food system \u2013 from inputs and production, through processing, storage, transport and retailing, to consumption \u2013 can contribute much more to the eradication of malnutrition,\u201d the FAO said.,The Philippines is one of the world\u2019s \u201cmega biodiversity\u201d countries, rich in both fauna and flora.,\u201cWhile the country is abundant in natural resources, environmental assets remain unavailable to poor groups owing to exclusion, insecure land tenure, lack of access to technologies; or the resources are degraded,\u201d the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) emphasized.,Local groups like the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM), ,Unyon ng Manggagawa sa Agrikultura, (UMA), ,Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, (KMP), and, Alyansa ng Magbubukid sa Asyenda Luisita, (AMBALA) agree with the UNDP\u2019s observation.,The situation in ,Hacienda Luisita, is a prime example of such predicaments \u2013 farmworkers toiling away for several years only to receive little or nothing in return, according to farmers' organizations.,\u201cFor every one farmer in the developed world, there are 19 in the developing world. Where there is mechanization, fewer workers can produce more food,\u201d the FAO said. In response to this issue, the Department of Agriculture (DA) established the Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization.,In 2012, agriculture had a 32% share in the total employment, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). This is slightly lower than in previous years., ,However, the share of agriculture in the country's economy was only 11%, according to PSA.,In 2013, the government announced that it will focus on creating more jobs in the agriculture sector.,Distribution by sub-sector. Source: Philippine Statistics Authority, CountrySTAT,PH Crops. Source: Philippine Statistics Authority, CountrySTAT,The World Bank reported that the share of agriculture in the country's economy has been halved over the years, from 24.6% in 1985 to 12.8% in 2011.,PSA noted that in 2012, the country's earnings from agricultural exports were lower by 7.9% from the previous year, while import expenditures grew by 3.6%.,These figures may seem baffling since the Philippines is a predominantly agricultural country, yet improvement in the agriculture sector has been rather slow.,Agriculture and poverty,The FAO stressed the need for policies enhancing agricultural productivity and food availability.,\u201cAgricultural productivity growth contributes to better nutrition through raising incomes, especially in countries where the sector accounts for a large share of the economy and employment, and by reducing the cost of food for all consumers,\u201d the FAO explained.,A study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggested that agricultural growth contributes to a country's overall poverty reduction.,\u201cThe payoff from investments in agricultural research, development, extension and education comes in the form of sustained increase in agricultural productivity,\u201d the study said. This can increase the GDP/agricultural worker, positively contributing to poverty reduction. ,Fishermen and farmers have always had the highest poverty incidence among the country\u2019s basic sectors from 2003 to 2009, according to the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB).,Poverty incidence among fishermen grew in the past six years while poverty incidence among farmers remained virtually unchanged. Region IX had the highest poverty incidence among farmers at 54%. For fishermen, the highest was in CARAGA, at 59.2%.,It is quite ironic that those who are providing most of the nation's food are also among the most ,food insecure,.,\u201cAchieving food security means not just ensuring that sufficient food is produced, but also that everyone has access to it \u2013 and failures of access to food, particularly for the most marginal communities, are largely hidden from the public view,\u201d the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) stressed.,The UNESCAP advised countries to take care of its environment to achieve agricultural sustainability and food security. The FAO reported that around half of the Philippines\u2019 irrigated cropland \u201chas already been lost to urban development.\u201d,GDP growth not enough?,INCLUSIVE GROWTH? Can all sectors, including farmers and fishermen, feel the country's 7.2% GDP growth? Rappler file photo,\u201cPoverty encompasses different dimensions of deprivation that relate to human capabilities including consumption and food security, health, education, rights, voice, security, dignity and decent work,\u201d the OECD said.,Despite the country\u2019s recent strides in its economic performance \u2013 7.2% GDP growth in 2013 \u2013 more Filipinos were hungry by the end of 2013. According to the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) ,survey,, 41% of Filipino households (or 8.8 million households) claim to be food-poor.,What does this ,paradox, tell us?,According to the FAO, economic growth alone will not solve food insecurity, it must be paired with:,The FAO emphasized the importance of pro-poor policies. \u201cThe growth can raise incomes and reduce hunger, but higher economic growth may not reach everyone. It may not lead to more and better jobs for all, unless policies specifically target the poor, especially those in rural areas.\u201d,\u201cIn poor countries, hunger and poverty reduction will only be achieved with growth that is not only sustained, but also broadly shared,\u201d the FAO added.,The Philippines must also improve its calamity preparedness and recovery systems. The FAO, reported, that by the end of 2011, the Philippines lost over 600,000 tons of milled rice due to typhoons, while 6% of the country\u2019s rice farmlands were destroyed.,After Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), agricultural damages amounted to ,P31.13 billion, as of January 2014, according to DA.,Hungry tiger cub?,Rice is a staple food for most Southeast Asian countries, including the four \u201ctiger cub economies\u201d \u2013 the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.,Production of rice paddy in 2010.

Other developing nations in Southeast Asia are also trying to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of alleviating extreme hunger and poverty by 2015. , ,(Source: NSCB, FAO),The lower the level of food inadequacy, the better. Compared to other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines lies somewhere in the middle. ,From 2010-2012, the Philippines had the ,5th highest ,food inadequacy at 54%, behind Cambodia (27.1%), Myanmar (29.5%), Laos (38.3%), and Timor Leste (46.1%), according to the FAO.,Among Asia's so-called \"tiger cubs,\" the Philippines had the highest prevalence of food inadequacy. The others \u2013 Malaysia (6.9%), Thailand (15.5%), and Indonesia (15.8%) \u2013 are making leaps in reducing inadequate food access.,In 7 years, or from 2005-2012, the Philippines reduced its food inadequacy by only 1.7% compared to  Indonesia (8.8%) and Thailand (3.3%).,According to the 2013 World Food Insecurity ,Report ,of the FAO, 15.6 million Filipinos were undernourished from 2011 to 2013. This barely changed since 1990, when it was at 15.5 million.,These figures paint a picture of how serious the Philippines is in its fight against ,hunger and poverty,. ,Though we may be lagging behind in the past few years, it is never too late to pick up our pace; after all, the challenge to alleviate hunger goes beyond 2015. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/52372-agriculture-hunger-food-security", "title": "PH agriculture: Why is it important?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/business/economy-watch/84323-project-waves-toward-sustainable-development,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/117894-prediksi-seriea-liga-italia-2016,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/92207-sws-food-poverty-survey-first-quarter-2015"},

Ia menorehkan tulisannya pada secarik kertas tersebut. ,\u201cBeliau selalu mencatat semuanya,\u201d kata juru bicara wakil presiden, Husein \"Uceng\" Abdullah, pada Rappler, Selasa malam, 22 Desember. ,Malam itu berbagai pertanyaan dari Forum Pemimpin Redaksi ditujukan pada Kalla. Mulai dari kasus saham PT Freeport Indonesia hingga kesehatan pribadi. Seperti diketahui Kalla sempat dirawat di rumah sakit, September ini.,Rappler Indonesia, yang diwakili Uni Lubis dan Febriana Firdaus, juga mendapat kesempatan untuk bertanya.,Berikut adalah sebagian pertanyaan yang Rappler ajukan pada Kalla, yang diberi judul \u201cCatatan akhir tahun Wakil Presiden Jusuf Kalla\u201d. Selebihnya adalah pertanyaan peserta di forum.  ,Apakah target Anda selama jadi Wapres tahun ini tercapai? ,Tentu ukurannya macam-macam. Ukuran dari segi ekonomi pertumbuhan kita capai, pajak kita capai, tapi kita berusaha keras. Saya kira OK, banyak, keamanan stabil. ,Ada yang belum tercapai? ,Tergantung, cita-cita banyak. Tapi yang seperti saya bilang tadi (Mengulangi soal pencapaian di bidang ekonomi).,Apa yang paling mengganggu seorang Jusuf Kalla?,Hampir semuanya. Masalah bangsa keseluruhan, bagaimana sosialnya stabil, kita lebih baik, semuanya menyita perhatian. ,Soal Freeport, mungkin? Keponakan anda, Erwin Aksa, disebut-sebut pernah ketemu bos Freeport, Jim Bob? , ,Kemenakan saya yang bertemu, saya yang harus bertanggung jawab? ,Apa yang terjadi saat Sudirman melapor soal Freeport? ,Sudirman ,(Menteri Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral Sudirman Said) ,kan ada dulu di masyarakat transparansi bersama Erry Riyana, jadi dia semangatnya itu (Sambil mengepalkan tangannya di dada).,Saya bilang Maroef (Direktur Utama PT Freeport Indonesia Maroef Sjamsoedin) kok sendirian, padahal ada SOP (,Standar Operating Procedure,) di Freeport harus berdua. ,Tidak ada yang mendorong, dia sendiri. ,Apalagi (kasus Freeport) menyebut nama saya. Jokowi marah, saya juga marah. Kalau kita tidak menyetujui (Sudirman), itu dianggap kita membenarkan. ,(Lagian) 9 persen itu terlalu sedikit. (Sambil tertawa).,Jusuf Kalla kontroversial, dan selalu jadi ,bad cop,, sedangkan Joko Widodo adalah ,good cop,? ,Kadang kita harus membuat kebijakan yang tidak populer. Kita harus siap membuat kebijakan yang tidak disukai ataupun disukai. ,Tahun ini ada menteri (Menteri Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman Rizal Ramli) yang suka menyerang Kalla, kenapa ya? ,Kurang kompak lah, pandangan yang berbeda, ataupun niat yang berbeda (Sambil tersenyum lebar).,Sebenarnya tidak dibenarkan juga, saya bilang (ke menteri itu), \u201cEtika apa Anda ini?\u201d ,Tahun ini juga ada menteri (Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan) yang membuat keputusan dan mengagetkan khalayak umum juga kan? ,Soal Go-Jek, Jonan terlalu kaku. Teknologi selalu membuat perubahan dan perubahan selalu lebih cepat daripada peraturan. Peraturan harus selalu diubah. ,Dulu Jakarta, selalu naik dokar, begitu ada mobil naik omlet. Lama-lama ada bis, mati semua omlet. Lalu ada ojek, ada Go-Jek, mati lagi ojek. Besok ada ,subway,, mati semua. ,Kita harus selalu siap. (Kalla mengatakan pada Jonan) Itu motor ,dikir, tiap bulan, kasihlah dia otoritas. Kedua pengemudinya. Tinggal mengganti saja peraturan, dari 4 roda menjadi 2 roda. ,Apa beda menjadi wakil presiden zaman Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono dan Joko Widodo? ,Memang, dulu jelas, sebelum maju ada perjanjian, sesuai dengan pengetahuan masing-masing. Kalau sekarang tidak ada peraturan itu, tetap hampir semua diputuskan lewat rapat. ,Jadi sampai setahun ini rapatnya lebih dari 200 kali. Jadi hampir semua kebijakannya keputusan diambil dalam rapat. Kadang menteri lagi di daerah, besok rapat, bingung dia. ,Tapi itu artinya ada kebersamaan dalam hal pengambilan keputusan. Dulu kita sudah putusin pembagiannya, sekarang satu-dua hari bisa dua-tiga kali rapat. ,Pemberantasan korupsi tahun ini, ada keraguan dari aktivis anti-korupsi. Menurut seorang Jusuf Kalla, pemerintah telah berhasil memenuhi komitmenya dalam bidang ini? ,Soal anti-korupsi, dalam satu kelompok, seakan dia yang paling pantas mewakili gerakan anti-korupsi, nanti kita lihat. Dari ukuran orang yang ditangkap pasti hebat. ,Anda pernah dirawat di Rumah Sakit Cipto Mangunkusumo, ada resolusi kesehatan untuk tahun depan?  ,Enggak ada, ,alhamdulillah, sehat. ,\u2014Rappler.com,BACA JUGA:", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/116921-catatan-akhir-tahun-jusuf-kalla-2015", "title": "Catatan akhir tahun Wakil Presiden Jusuf Kalla", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective"},

They will also be given a posthumous promotion.,While the exact narrative of events have yet to established, officials have said the SAF commandos found themselves in a ,\u201cmisencounter\u201d, with the BIFF, a faction of the MILF.,Citing preliminary reports, Roxas said members of the BIFF attacked SAF commandos, after which government forces had a \u201cmisencounter\u201d with the MILF because they were avoiding BIFF territory. Roxas is also the chairman of the National Police Commission.,Roxas, however, said he was not privy to the operation in Maguindanao. Neither was PNP OIC Espina.

The president, however, did not categorically answer if he gave the go signal for the operation or not.,The PNP has since launched a Board of Inquiry to probe the incident. The MILF has also spearheaded its own independent review of the incident. The board will have to find out why top PNP officials were kept out of the loop.,The MILF and the Philippine government are in the final stages of a peace deal that would establish a new autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao. The development of the deal is now in limbo, following the clash.,At least two senators have withdrawn their support for the Bangsamoro Basic Law, meaning a majority is no longer in favor of the measure. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/82277-mamasapano-slain-pnp-saf-return-home", "title": "Hero\u2019s welcome: Slain PNP-SAF back home", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/174317-rumors-pacquiao-decline-greatly-exaggerated,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/fashion/133835-solenn-heussaff-wedding-dress,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/nation/81883-pnp-saf-maguindanao-terrorists,http://www.rappler.com/nation/81968-pnp-saf-zamboanga-maguindanao"},

Tim Inter Milan dalam laga Coppa Italia melawan Cagliari, 15 Desember 2015. Foto oleh EPA ,JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Inggris dan Italia adalah dua kutub liga sepak bola dunia. Masing-masing memiliki kekhasan sendiri. Secara komersial, Inggris memang masih berkuasa. Tapi soal kompleksitas taktik dan strategi, Negeri Pisa masih diakui sebagai yang paling kompleks.,Di Inggris, penggunaan taktik yang kompleks hanya didominasi klub-klub besar seperti Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, duo Manchester dan Tottenham Hotspur.,Beberapa klub kecil memang melakukannya. Tapi, itu karena pengaruh manajer asing di klub tersebut. Seperti manajer asal Spanyol Quique Sanchez Flores di Watford, Ronald Koeman (Belanda) di Southampton atau Roberto Martinez (Spanyol) di Everton dan Slaven Bilic (Kroasia) di West Ham United.,Di Italia, hampir semua klub memiliki kemampuan strategi yang mendalam. Bahkan klub yang baru promosi ke Serie A tiga musim lalu, Sassuolo, pun memiliki kemampuan taktik yang tak bisa diremehkan. ,Liga Italia bisa melakukan itu bukan karena para pelatih impor. Tapi justru karena ,allenatore ,(pelatih) domestik. Para pelatih Italia adalah pemikir sepak bola. Mereka adalah produk budaya sepak bola yang mendalam dan kompleks.,Jika di Inggris, hanya empat manajer yang berasal dari dalam negeri. Di Italia, justru hanya ada dua pelatih asing. Mereka adalah pelatih Fiorentina Paulo Sousa (Portugal) dan pelatih AS Roma Rudi Garcia (Prancis).,Kompleksitas strategi di Italia itu pernah diungkapkan asisten pelatih Jose Mourinho, Rui Faria, dalam sebuah wawancara di stasiun televisi Sky Sports.,Asisten pelatih Mourinho sejak di klub Portugal Uniao Leiria itu mengatakan, perubahan strategi di Italia terjadi hampir setiap menit pertandingan.,\u201cMenit ini mereka mengganti begini. Kami kemudian merespons juga dengan beberapa perubahan. Kemudian lawan juga menggantinya karena kami juga ikut mengganti. Begitu terus yang terjadi selama 90 menit pertandingan,\u201d kata Faria.,Faria di Italia selama dua musim pada 2008/2009 dan 2009/2010. Dia mendampingi Mourinho di Inter Milan dan ikut berkontribusi mempersembahkan ,treble winners ,(tiga gelar dalam semusim), ,untuk ,La Beneamata,\u2014julukan Inter\u2014pada musim keduanya.,\u201cDari semua negara yang pernah saya datangi, sepak bola Italia adalah yang paling sulit,\u201d ujar lelaki 40 tahun tersebut menambahkan.,Perang taktik yang ketat itupula yang membuat konstelasi di klasemen terus berubah. Hingga ,giornata ,(pekan) ke-17, pemuncak klasemen alias ,capolista ,berubah sebanyak 9 kali! Dan hingga pekan ini, belum ada yang bisa menjadi ,capolista ,lebih dari tiga ,giornata,.,Karena itu, Inter Milan yang kini menguasai singgasana Serie A pun belum tentu bakal langgeng kekuasaannya. Sebab, pasukan Roberto Mancini itu ditempel ketat Fiorentina dan Napoli yang hanya berselisih satu poin di belakang. Di posisi keempat, ada juara bertahan Juventus dengan selisih 3 angka.,Lantas, siapa yang akan keluar menjadi juara di akhir musim?,Inter Milan paling berpeluang juara,Bagaimanapun, Inter Milan adalah klub yang paling berpotensi menjuarai Serie A musim ini. Mereka sudah mulai stabil di musim kedua kembalinya Roberto Mancini di kursi kepelatihan klub tersebut.,Setelah musim lalu hanya finis di peringkat kedelapan, musim ini Inter mulai konsisten di lima besar. Sejak pekan pertama, klub berjuluk ,Nerazzurri, tak pernah keluar dari lima besar. Bahkan, sejak pekan ke-15 mereka memimpin klasemen.,Salah satu kunci sukses mereka adalah pembenahan fundamental Mancini. Mantan manajer Manchester City itu memperkuat barisan pertahanan dengan mendatangkan bek tangguh Atletico Madrid Miranda. Selain itu, bek kanan Martin Montoya dipinjam dari Barcelona.,Begitu juga gelandang bertahan Felipe Melo. Pemain Brasil itu dibawa ke Giussepe Meazza, markas Inter, dari Galatasaray demi memperkuat pertahanan.,Selain mendatangkan pemain baru, Mancini juga mulai mengubah gaya bermain Inter. Rival sekota AC Milan itu cenderung bermain konservatif dan lebih banyak bertahan. Para bek sayap pun tidak terlalu banyak ,overlapping,.,Hasilnya, Inter menjadi tim yang paling sedikit kebobolan. Total jumlah kebobolan mereka hanya 11 gol. Bandingkan dengan Napoli (13 gol), dan Fiorentina (15 gol).,Satu-satunya klub Italia yang tidak pernah terdegradasi dalam sejarah Serie A itu kini tinggal bermain konsisten. Mancini juga harus lebih adaptif dengan dengan perubahan taktik. Sebab, lawan bakal terus berusaha membongkar skema mereka.,Musim ini, sudah lima kali Inter berganti formasi. Di awal musim mereka seperti sudah menemukan stabilitas dalam 4-3-1-2. Bermain dengan tiga gelandang bertahan membuat lawan sangat sulit menerobos pertahanan mereka.,Namun, skema tersebut membuat produktivitas gol Inter minim.  Mereka lantas berubah menjadi 4-3-3, 3-5-2, 4-4-2, dan 4-2-3-1. Skema terakhir inilah yang konsisten mereka lakukan di tiga laga terakhir.,Masalah Inter saat ini tinggal menajamkan lini serang mereka. Sebab, jumlah gol mereka adalah yang paling sedikit dari lima besar klub papan atas. Mauro Icardi dan kawan-kawan hanya mencetak 23 gol.,Karena itulah, mereka berupaya untuk mendatangkan Ezequiel Lavezzi di bursa transfer Januari ini. Tapi, negosiasi dengan ,winger ,Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) itu masih terkendala gaji. Kabarnya, Inter bakal angkat tangan jika pemain Argentina itu meminta lebih dari EUR 3 juta (sekitar Rp 45 miliar) per tahun.,Jika ingin meraih gelar liga, saat inilah momen yang tepat bagi Inter. Sebab, baru kali ini persaingan gelar juara Serie A begitu terbuka. Sepanjang empat musim sebelumnya, Juventus terlalu dominan.,Dan karena dominasi Juventus mulai luntur pasca kepergian ,allenatore ,Antonio Conte dan beberapa pemain kunci (Andrea Pirlo, Carlos Tevez, dan Arturo Vidal), Inter harus mengambil kesempatan itu musim ini.,Bagaimana dengan klub lain?,Fiorentina kurang variasi, Napoli terlalu bergantung Higuain,Peluang menjuarai Serie A sejatinya masih terbuka untuk tiga klub lain, yakni Fiorentina, Napoli, dan sang juara bertahan Juventus. Namun, mereka memiliki persoalan yang harus diselesaikan jika ingin memenanginya.,Fiorentina, misalnya. ,Allenatore ,Paulo Sousa kurang adaptif dalam mengatur formasi. Sepanjang musim, tim berjuluk ,La Viola ,itu hanya memiliki dua alternatif skema, yakni 4-2-3-1 dan 3-4-2-1.,Padahal, untuk mengarungi Serie A yang ketat dengan perang strategi, skema yang monoton berpeluang kandas. Apalagi, Sousa terlalu terobsesi dengan penggunaan tiga bek.,Sementara itu, Napoli juga memiliki masalah. Klub berjuluk ,Il Partinopei ,itu terlalu bergantung pada striker Gonzalo Higuain. Bomber Argentina itu sudah menjadi ,capocannonieri ,(pencetak gol terbanyak) Serie A dengan 16 gol. Itu artinya, hampir 50 persen gol ,La Viola ,datang dari Higuain.,Bagaimana dengan Juventus?,Klub milik konglomerat keluarga Agnelli itu mengawali Serie A dengan banyak masalah hingga hanya meraih lima poin dari enam laga pertama. Akibatnya, mereka baru bisa menembus lima besar Serie A di pekan ke-14.,Namun, pasukan Massimiliano Allegri mulai menemukan konsistensinya. Dalam tujuh laga terakhir, mereka terus meraih ,streak ,alias kemenangan beruntun. Inter harus mewaspadai mereka karena sejak 28 Oktober belum ada yang bisa mengalahkan Juventus, bahkan menahan seri sekalipun.,Klub berjuluk ,La Vecchia Signora ,(Si Nyonya Tua) itu bisa kembali meraih gelar jika Inter, Fiorentina, dan Napoli terus kehilangan poin. Sebab, tidak ada yang bisa menghentikan Juventus jika mental juara mereka telah pulih.,Karena itu, kekalahan Inter 1-2 dari Lazio pada 20 Desember lalu tidak boleh lagi terjadi. Itu jika mereka ingin meraih gelar Serie A untuk kali pertama sejak enam tahun lalu. \u2014 ,Rappler.com,BACA JUGA: ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/117894-prediksi-seriea-liga-italia-2016", "title": "Prediksi paruh kedua Serie A: Inter Milan berpeluang akhiri puasa gelar", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa"},

They did not die in vain.\",Espina did not elaborate, citing \"sketchy\" information from the field. \"What we know so far is that there is an ongoing operation in the area against a high-value target believed to be behind the recent spate of bombings in Central Mindanao,\" he added.,Initial reports on Sunday noon from two Rappler sources said that the SAF teams conducted \"law enforcement operations against [a] high value target\" in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao, at 2:30 am Sunday.

Our mandate is to set minimum wages,\" the board said in a resolution.,The board asked petitioners to conform with standards prescribed by law in petitions that will be filed in the future.,Trade Union Congress of the Philippines-Nagkaisa's Alan Tanjusay, however, asked the regional wage board to \"show the formula they used as basis for the new wage order and subject it to healthy discussion.\",\"They better explain it to the workers immediately or else their lack of credibility may invite confusion, if not incite chaos, particularly among poor workers,\" he said, calling the P15 increase \"revolting.\",TUCP was among the petitioners before the RTWPB.,On the other hand, Kilusang Mayo Uno chair Elmer Labog said such, \"region-based wage hikes don\u2019t address the attacks carried out against the minimum wage in the country for decades.\",\"We are fighting for the implementation of a National Minimum Wage in the amount of P16,000 monthly to give workers some immediate relief and to turn back the attacks against the minimum wage throughout the country,\u201d Labog said.,He added that the wage hike is insufficient, considering increases in the prices of basic commodities and the fare hike in Metro Manila trains. ,'Let market forces decide',Reacting to the wage hike, lawyer Noel Balsicas of the People Management Association of the Philippines said the mandated minimum wage is an outmoded means of wage determination.,\"This will have an effect on other personnel who are not directly affected by the increase through wage compression or wage distortion,\" he said.,Employers are now forced to increase the salary of a worker with a typically higher rate than a minimum wage earner to \"restore the seniority of that individual.\",Balsicas said it is better to let market forces decide salary increases instead of the government mandating them.,\"It also backfires in a way to the workers,\" he added, explaining that manufacturers are now forced to increase the price of their products and services to sustain the higher salaries of their workers.,This creates an \"additional pressure on the cost of living,\" he said, calling it a \"chicken-and-egg situation.\",Around 40% of manufacturing cost is labor, he added. ,\u2013, Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/87217-wage-hike-approved-metro-manila-workers", "title": "P15 minimum wage hike for Metro Manila workers approved", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/specials/miss-universe/133424-pia-wurtzbach-dr-mike-relationship-status-mikhail-varshavski,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/63518-nutritional-status-filipinos,http://www.rappler.com/business/55548-exemption-filing-tax-bir,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/161229-pacquiao-next-fight-uae-horn-promoter-australia"},

Photo by Karlos Manlupig/AFP,MANILA, Philippines (Updated) \u2013 After the signing, the groundwork begins. Rebels will soon have to give up their firearms, while politicians must do their share to craft and pass a law that makes peace more acceptable than war.,The success of the peace deal signed Thursday, March 27, by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) depends largely on the a,bility of the Aquino administration to prevail upon Congress to pass the Bangsamoro law in the spirit that the panels agreed on and, equally, on the ,sincerity of the MILF to drop the armed struggle. (READ: ,'Bangsamoro deal illegal, creates substate' \u2013 Miriam,),\",Hindi komo nagpirmahan na, tapos na. Hindi. May mga ,stages, pa 'yan eh. Mga, phases,\" ,Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin told reporters in an interview in March. (They may have signed but it's not over yet. There are stages. There are phases.),The government and MILF panels envision a new order in the areas notorious for decades-long conflict. Where guns are said to be more valuable than wives, MILF fighters ,w,ill lay down their arms to a third party. ,Where the infamous ,Ampatuan massacre, happened, private armies will be disbanded. ,Military presence in the region will be reduced. Peace and order will be the responsibility of the yet-to-be-created Bangsamoro Police Force, which is civilian in character. (,Read the program for normalization in the Bangsamoro below,),This has never been done in post-war Philippines \u2013 in the scale that the agreement envisions.,The MILF claims to have 11,000 combatants, although this will now be the subject of verification. ,They are concentrated in the MILF's bailiwick, central Mindanao, although some units are also in western Mindanao. Other threat groups like the rogue Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) members and the private armies will have to be disarmed, too.,Military troops are also concentrated in Mindanao \u2013 Western Mindanao Command (Wesmincom) and Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom) \u2013 because of the threat groups there. ,The 6th Infantry Division that covers MILF bailiwick central Mindanao has 6,000 troops.,It won't be easy,Until the Bangsamoro Police Force is set up, the military and the MILF will be jointly tracking and documenting private armies and other armed groups, controlling the flow of loose firearms, and making sure ceasefire is sustained.,The MILF command has to explain to its members what is at stake and what they must do for peace, Gazmin explained.,Decommissioning is the part where the MILF is expected to exert more effort because it won't be easy.,\"Everybody is observing. The ball is with the MILF. The burden of proof is on them,\" said a military officer who spent years in central Mindanao. He refused to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the issue.,HISTORIC: President Benigno S. Aquino III huddles with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) representatives, led by chairman Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, for a group photo souvenir during a courtesy call at the President\u2019s Hall of the Malaca\u00f1an Palace. Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau,A lot hinges on what will happen to the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), the breakaway group of the MILF opposed to the deal. The officer said both panels cannot allow the BIFF to grow and become the new MILF, referring to the latter's split with the MNLF in the 1970s. The MILF would grow to become the more dominant rebel organization.,Colonel Dickson Hermoso, spokesperson of the 6th ID, is confident that BIFF has weakened. ,With the help of the MILF, the military last month overran BIFF camps and set up detachments to make sure the BIFF won't return to the area. (READ: ,Military sets up detachments in captured BIFF camps,),\"Some of them might even go back [to the MILF],\" he told Rappler.,The military officer also thinks the MILF should take the lead in future operations against BIFF, other threat grous, the private armies and even in ,rido, or clan wars that are prevalent in these areas. The members of these peace \"spoilers\" are their own relatives or friends, the officer said.,\"If the MILF fails to address this, then we are back to square one,\" he said.,Realistic expectations,Military officers interviewed by Rappler are realistic about the challenges ahead, given the peace agreement's ambitious timeline. The signing is the first step in a process that, they say, will take time. ,\"I don\u2019t think it will happen [complete decommissioning]. There will be an attempt to do it. They are all armed. We are talking about changing a culture and tradition. It won't be so easy,\" said the military officer.,\"If you can demobilize them by 50%, that will be great,\" said another officer.,The current cooperation between government forces and the MILF is already a success \"that could not have been imagined 10 years ago,\" he added.,Hermoso, who hails from Cotabato City, is celebrating. \"Being a stakeholder, I have high hopes. There are new challenges in ending the 4-decades long conflict but the confidence is high. You can feel that the communities are very supportive,\" he said.,An officer assigned in the area in the 1990s recalled how bitter the relationship was between the military and MILF commanders. ,Today, he noted, these commanders have become friends, sharing stories of their previous encounters.,This is a marked change from the conditions that gave rise to the all-out war against the MILF more than a decade ago, when Joseph Estrada was president. During that bloody campaign, the military crushed Camp Abubakar, the main headquarters of the MILF, and closed all avenues to peace.,Part of the change can be attributed to how Filipino soldiers have learned to respect Muslim culture.,\"There is a realization also that the problems of insurgency are multi-faceted. It is not the military alone that can solve the problem. There are economic issues, political, religion. It\u2019s complex that there are legislative issues that need to be answered,\" added military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Zagala.,The Ampatuan massacre in 2009 \u2013 the world's worst case of election violence that embarrassed the military \u2013 may have been the catalyst that forced the military to reflect and give the peace process a chance. ,Military men in the area were accused of enjoying cozy ties with the Ampatuan clan. The Ampatuans, on the other hand, were believed to have been used by the military to run after the MILF. ,\"It was a turnaround. It was a moment of opportunity. I cannot explain it. It changed the attitude of soldiers. Ten years ago, it was a question of who has the most guns. After the massacre, it was different,\" said the military officer. ,Warehouse,Decommissioning is the most emotional issue for the MILF.,In the words of its chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal, the MILF ceases to exist as an armed group and starts positioning itself as a \"social movement.\" (READ: ,What happens to MILF after peace deal?,),\"All the agreements are substantive and important and very, very hard, but the issue of normalization is the most sensitive, emotional...As far as I know, it entails a lot of sacrifices on the part of the MILF because to build real peace in Mindanao, we have to decommission our forces,\" Iqbal said.,The wording is carefully selected. It's not disarmament, which implies surrender. Decommissioning means MILF firearms will be put \"beyond use,\" probably stored in a warehouse, depending on the recommendation of the Independent Decommissioning Body (IDB).,In contrast, when the MNLF signed a peace agreement with the Ramos administration, there was no demobilization or disarmament plan. \",There was only the plan of integration. We cannot integrate them all,\" recalled Zagala.,MNLF fighters joined the police and the military, but not all were qualified. Those who were not integrated managed to keep their firearms. In due time, the disgruntled ex-rebels returned to fighting government.,Convinced they were left out in the peace process, MNLF rebels seized Zamboanga City in September last year, paralyzing the city and causing the worst security nightmare for the Aquino government.,The siege of Sabah by the Royal Security Force of the late Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram III was also linked to the peace process because it was mounted by former MNLF members who had complained of the MILF's silence on the Sabah issue. , ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/53994-real-peace-decommissioning-challenges", "title": "Real peace means the guns will have to go away", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/171463-nadine-lustre-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/nation/49041-maguindanao-massacre-aquino-sore-point,http://www.rappler.com/nation/49757-military-detachments-biff-camps"},

(READ: ,Marawi under siege: It's like 'looking at Aleppo,),Major General Rolando Bautista, commander of the military's 1st infantry division that has jurisdiction over the Lanao provinces, said the troops were not prepared for the sniping skills of the enemy. \u201cOne sniper can paralyze the movement of a whole company, even a battalion,\u201d he said.,Military tanks can only do so much, because the terrorists are armed with .50 caliber machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades that can pierce through metal.,Thus the tactical move to resort to airstrikes, which has caused much tension between the military and residents. ,\"Natatakot ako sa kanila dahil wala naman pinipili 'yan eh,. ,Ang mga, targets nila is, panay, guesswork ,nila 'yun eh,\" ,said Bishop Edwin dela Pe\u00f1a.

According to the military, the terrorists were acting upon the instructions of ISIS leaders in the Middle East who want a refuge in Southeast Asia for their fighters, as ISIS continues to lose territory in the Middle East.,A video of Hapilon and the Maute brothers planning an attack on the first day of Ramadan was also recovered in a safe house.

In Marawi, the enemies attacked various parts of city. And they were mostly residents themselves who grew up here.,In Zamboanga, the houses occupied by enemies were mostly made of light materials. Here, the terrorists occupied Banggolo, where the houses are made of hardened concrete. Even airstrikes could not demolish them. ,\"In the Zamboanga siege, we were clearing houses built with light materials. Here, we are clearing hardened buildings. There are even tunnels,\" said Western Mindanao Command chief Lieutenant General Carlito Galvez.,The siege of Zamboanga City lasted 3 weeks, killing 19 government forces and 208 rebels, and dislocating 24,000 families.,In Marawi, 62 government forces have been killed as of June 18. This is already 3 times more than the deaths in Zamboanga. Up to 257 terrorists have been reported killed and almost all of the city\u2019s 200,000 have been evacuated.,And it's not over yet.,PAST THE BRIDGE, DANGER LURKS. The military announced they have the bridges entering Banggolo under control. But enemy snipers continue to prevent humanitarian workers from entering the area.

It would take days of airstrikes and troop advances before the military took control and pushed the terrorists to the other side of the Agus River. ,To this day, humanitarian workers could not cross the bridge because of the threat of enemy snipers. Rescue and retrieval are practically at a standstill.,But as ,hunger becomes a problem among trapped residents,, local government officials have encouraged them to risk getting hit by the snipers. \u201cEither they die inside the house or they die trying to get out,\u201d said Zia Alonto Adiong, spokesman of the provincial Crisis Management Committee.,Stray bullets from supposed sympathizers continue to reach the capitol, the city hall, and the headquarters.,A ,14-year-old boy praying at a mosque, was killed near the brigade headquarters while an Australian journalist ,survived a bullet ,that hit his neck while taking a video from inside the provincial capitol.,HOSTAGED.

Bangsamoro implementing panel chair Irene Santiago said they are reviewing tactics to make the rescue plan more effective.,It's a tough balancing act, said Dureza. The military is hesitant to impose temporary ceasefires to allow rescuers to go because it allows the terrorists to reposition.,But Galvez said their priority is the safety of trapped civilians and hostages.,3rd week,The Marawi clashes erupted on May 23 following a military raid that attempted to arrest Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was said to have brought his forces to the Lanao area late last year to link up with the Maute Group.

But the military said it's still not safe.,Looting is also a big cause of concern, but Galvez blamed professional looters. ,\"Kukuha talaga 'yan. Naka-van pa,\", he said.  ,Vehicles packed with luggage have attempted to enter the city, but are turned away at checkpoints.,Barangay defense system,After a meeting with Dureza, Marawi City Mayor Majul Usman Gandamra announced coordination with the military is underway to allow barangays to boost the presence of security forces in already cleared areas.,\"Yesterday, we had a meeting with our barangay officials over the concerns of constituents, especially about securing their properties and house. ,Nagkaroon po tayo ng ,(We had) coordination with the military and now we are processing an organization composed of barangay officials,\" the mayor said.,\"Sila po ang magiging countepart ng ating Armed Forces sa pag-secure ng kanilang respective barangays,\", he added. (They will be the counterpart of our Armed Forces in securing their respective barangays.),Galvez called it the \"barangay defense system,\" essentially tapping private armed groups to become force multipliers. He assigned the 1st Infantry Battalion to do this. ,It serves two purposes. The volunteers will guard properties from looters while helping make sure terrorists do not penetrate the military's dragnet.,The provincial capitol, previously empty and quiet, is back in business as more and more local officials show up to assert their power over the military that has practically taken over governance in the city the past two weeks. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/172084-marawi-tension-hostages-residents-impatient", "title": "Hundreds still trapped in Marawi as crisis enters 3rd week", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/nation/171413-propaganda-shows-marawi-priest-echoing-kidnappers-demand,http://www.rappler.com/nation/171473-samira-gutoc-tomawis-bangsamoro-resignation"},

PNP chief Ronald dela Rosa admits law enforcement in Marawi City could have been better, as government troops try to flush out local terrorists. File photo by Bobby Lagsa/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) on Wednesday, June 28, admitted a \"law enforcement failure\" in Marawi even before local terror groups and their sympathizers tried to take control of the city over a month ago.,\"In other major urban centers, we were prepared. In Marawi, they were really there. You may call it a slight failure on law enforcement when it comes to Marawi, if I'm being honest,\" said Director General Ronald dela Rosa during a panel interview aired live on the News 5 Facebook page.,The failure, said Dela Rosa, was cops' inability to curb the spread of loose firearms in the city, a situation he blamed on the local \"culture.\",The PNP chief, who was born, raised, and spent most of his career in Mindanao, said it was common for local politicians and other powerful local figures to have well-armed militias of their own.,Dela Rosa was being quizzed about the government's prior intelligence on the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups' plan to take over Marawi City.

What we underestimated was the support they would get. We were gaining victory in flushing them out of Butig but they ended up moving out to Marawi. The support, we were unable to estimate,\" said Dela Rosa.,\"They had accumulated bullets, bombs were already prepared,\" he added.,Tens of thousands of families have been ,forced to flee Marawi,, as military operations \u2013 including air strikes \u2013 continue against the terrorists, who earlier pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS).,One of the solutions to the law enforcement problem in Marawi, said Dela Rosa, was to deploy cops from Luzon or the Visayas to the city. Dela Rosa explained cops who hail from Marawi are sometimes afraid to enforce the law, lest they begin rido, or feuds between families.,More soldiers and police are being ,deployed to Marawi, from all over the country. Dela Rosa said recently, troops from the PNP's Special Action Force based in Zamboanga City were tapped to reinforce police efforts in the city.,Duterte placed the entire Mindanao island ,under martial law, just hours after the Marawi clashes erupted.

Senator Risa Hontiveros reminds senators Richard Gordon and Juan Miguel Zubiri of their changing stance on the need for a joint session on martial law.  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It was a heated debate on whether or not there should be a joint congressional session to debate on martial law, with two senators being called out for their apparent flip-flopping on the issue.,Minority senator Risa Hontiveros reminded senators Richard Gordon and Juan Miguel Zubiri, known allies of President Rodrigo Duterte, on their 2009 stand favoring a joint public session.,In 2009, Zubiri and Gordon were in favor of a joint public session to deliberate on then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's martial law in Maguindanao. But 8 years after, the two had a change of heart, saying there is no need to convene Congress to discuss Duterte's proclamation. (READ: ,No joint session on martial law? Congress 'shields' Duterte,),\"If I would be allowed to refresh the memory of the good gentleman from Bukidnon. In 2009, in the discussion in our Senate on this very question, the good gentleman from Bukidnon said, I quote: ,'Ito po (joint session) ay isang constitutional duty natin. Hindi po natin puwedeng hindi bigyan ng pansin itong joint session na ito dahil it will become bad precedent. Think about the future administrations.', I am sure [he] will recall his prophetic statement at the time,\" Hontiveros said.,(This is our constitutional duty. We cannot ignore this joint session because it will become bad precedent. Think about the future administrations.),A ,transcript of Zubiri's 2009 interview, also showed that he asked the Senate to think of the future in its decision, in case there would be an \"abusive\" president.,\"Forget about this administration. It's already reaching the 6-month term and ending its 6 months of public service. But what about the next administration? ,Kung abusado ang presidente at meron po siyang numerical superior strength sa House of Representatives ang gagawin lang niya is\u2026 Those who want to undermine this process will...say hindi na tayo kailangang mag-meeting dahil marami namang pumapabor,,\" Zubiri said then, which is a mirror of the present scenario.,(If the president is abusive and he has the numerical superior strength in the House of Representatives, all he would do is... Those who want to undermine this process will just say we don't need to meet because many are in favor.),\"Hindi puwede iyon ,(It should not be). We must make it a precedent ,na ,(that) if there's a martial law declaration the Congress, meaning the Senate and the House of Representatives, should meet and get the explanation of the president,\" he added in 2009.,Zubiri, in response to Hontiveros, said he committed a mistake when he voted for the revocation of martial law in 2009. ,\"At the time I was for revocation of the martial law declaration. I erred in my decision at the time. People make mistakes. If we run after these people with the full force of the law, maybe this would not have been this grave today,\" Zubiri said in defending the change in his stand.,The 2009 martial law, however, was lifted only 8 days after, even before Congress scheduled the vote on the matter.,\"Now I realized the gravity of the situation. This is happening in my home as I mentioned,\u201d he added.,Zubiri said there is an urgent need to declare martial law in Mindanao to neutralize \"terrorists\" and that Duterte must be given leeway to fulfill his mandate.,But Hontiveros remains unconvinced: \"I understand and respect the passion of the gentleman from Bukidnon. Though his opinion may have changed, the Constitution has not.\",Zubiri, in anticipation of online attacks against him, said a joint session had to be convened in 2009 because the chamber then was for the revocation of martial law. In contrast, majority of senators now are in favor of the proclamation.,\"I can clearly recall then. I want to put this on record. ,Baka fake news na naman na ,(There might be fake news that) I was schooled by Senator Risa on my position in 2009. ,Sigurado, gano'n 'yun eh, labanan ng social media, (It's sure to happen. It's like that, the battle on social media). I want to put this on record. At the time, majority of senators were for the revocation. That was the sense of the Senate to revoke, we wanted a joint session but things have changed, and I said, now it's different. Tremendously deterioriated since 2009. ,Nagkamali tayo, nagka-grabe-grabe, nagkaleche-leche na [ang sitwasyon sa Mindanao] ,(We made a mistake, it got worse in Mindanao),\" Zubiri said.,Hontiveros denied \"schooling\" Zubiri but insisted a public official's past statements are important especially on a major issue such as martial law.,\"'Yung mga salitang sinabi noon nananatiling mahalaga sa habang panahon, (The words uttered before remain important in the long term) especially when we're faced with making a decision about similar situations later in the future. No one is schooling anyone,\" Hontiveros said.,Gordon in 2009,Hontiveros also took the time to remind Gordon of his earlier stand.,The lady senator, quoting Gordon's exact words during the joint session in 2009, said: \"To my mind Mr President, if I may be so bold, we are a co-equal branch of government and the Constitution provides that we must review. And therefore, it behooves the executive that she (Arroyo) sends the highest officials involved in the declaration of martial law. ,Lumalabas po rito sa 'di nila pagdalo, lumalabas po rito tila binabalewala ang kahalagahan ng Kongreso, ng House at Senate, sa isang napakahalagang bagay, (It appears now that with their absence, they are ignoring the importance of Congress, of the House and the Senate, on a very significant matter.),Gordon disputed Hontiveros' interpretation, saying he did not refer to any joint session in his statement. Gordon said he uttered those words to refer to the absence of high-ranking officials in the joint session.,\"'Yung sinabi ko noon, panahon na 'yun para tawagin ang mga representante ng Pangulo, 'di pinag-uusapan ang joint session noon. Dito dinadala 'nyo ang usapin sa joint session, malinaw na 'di joint session [ang topic],\", Gordon said.,(What I said then was to call the representatives of the President. The topic then was not about the joint session. Here, you are trying to bring the issue to the joint session when it is not the topic.),Gordon also said there is no point in holding a joint public session because military officials are prohibited from attending it \u2013 something that the lady senator opposed.,\"Maaalala po ninyo noong 2009 may mga AFP officials na inimbita at nagsalita doon sa joint session. Issue noon ay bakit wala si dating pangulong Macapagal-Arroyo. Naaalala ko po dahil andun po ako bilang miyembro ng House of Representatives,\", Hontiveros said.,(You may recall that in 2009, there were AFP officials invited and who spoke during the joint session. The issue then was why former president Macapagal-Arroyo was not present. I remember it because I was there as a member of the House of Representatives.),In the end, the Senate, voting 12-9, ,rejected the minority's proposal for a joint session, with the House of Representatives.,Senators Loren Legarda and Joseph Victor Ejercito both earlier said ,they were in favor of it, but changed their minds during the actual voting. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/171510-hontiveros-gordon-zubiri-martial-law-joint-session", "title": "No to joint session on martial law?

They used as front Farhana\u2019s commodity trading business in Surabaya, Indonesia.,Back in those days, Al Qaeda was the world\u2019s biggest terrorist network and JI was a member. It was notorious for the worst act of terror in the world\u2019s biggest Muslim country, the 2002 Bali bombing that killed more than 200.,The military used the Maute couple as tracers, according to a military officer privy to the operations, to detect activities of the JI operatives here. ,PATRIARCH AND MATRIARCH.

The terrorist allegedly involved in the 2005 beheading of 3 Christian schoolgirls in Indonesia was killed inside the compound of the Mindanao State University (MSU) in Marawi. (READ: ,PH military says Indonesian terrorist killed,),An intelligence report said Sanusi was found in a house there owned by Mohammad Khayyam Maute, one of the many sons of Cayamora and Farhana who would 5 years later wreak havoc in the city they grew up in. ,It seemed the military had relaxed on the Maute family after Sanusi\u2019s death in 2012. Little did they know that the sons would soon bring into the country the ideology of a terrorist group even more radical than Al Qaeda.,Omar Khayyam and Abdullah are the known leaders of the so-called \u201cMaute Brothers\u201d of the \u201cMaute Group\u201d, although they prefer the name Dawla Islamiyah. Both are believed to have been radicalized in the Middle East. Omar Khayyam completed Islamic Studies at Al-azhar University in Egypt. Abdullah also finished his Islamic Studies in Jordan, according to intelligence reports.,Omar is believed to be the brains behind the group while Abdullah serves as the commander of its military operations, athough a video shows even Mohammad contributed to this role.,We tell the story of a well-connected family behind a homegrown terrorist group that most effectively spread the ISIS ideology in the Philippines. This account is based on information from the intelligence community and multiple interviews with security officers, local officials, and residents of the two communities they sought to seize \u2013 Butig and Marawi City.,LEADERS. Omar and Abdullah Maute are the known leaders of the so-called Maute Brothers. ,It was also about the year 2012 when the Maute brothers began to display their extemist ideology and tendency for violence, according to Marawi residents interviewed by Rappler.,They were believed to be members of a violent clique that started out attacking gays in the city, warning them to \u201cstop what you are doing.\" Later, the group progressed to killing soldiers.,Samira Gutoc, back then an Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) assemblywoman and MSU regent, told Rappler how she asked the local police and military to investigate violence in the university. She said she was horrified to see pictures of \u201cyoung men in turbans\u201d responsible for attacks against victims who were all Christians., ,Residents now say that these were the beginnings of the Maute Group. But the military had relegated them to the sidelines, it appeared, as the following year would become one of the most challenging times for the country.,In between the May 2013 midterm elections, Filipinos attacked Sabah in February, followers of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) founder Nur Misuari seized villages in Zamboanga City in September, a massive earthquake hit Bohol in October, and a super typhoon hit Eastern Visayas in November.,The sons of Cayamora and Farhana regained the attention of the country\u2019s security apparatus in 2014 when they pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS), the more violent incarnate of Al Qaeda.,But it was in 2016 when they earned their now notorious name \"Maute Brothers\" after they attacked a military detachment and killed two soldiers in nearby Butig, the hometown of Farhana.,At least 4 military operations \u2013 Haribon 1, 2, 3  \u2013 were launched in Butig against the Maute Brothers in 2016. In April, they mimicked ISIS executions when they beheaded two Christian sawmill workers whom they dressed with orange clothes. In November, ,they flew the ISIS black flag at the town hall,.,The Maute Group would also be blamed for the ,September 2, 2016 Davao City bombing, that killed at least 15 people.,It was in Butig where Abu Sayyaf senior leader Isnilon Hapilon, the so-called prince of ISIS in Southeast Asia, would join the Maute Group in December 2016 to supposedly hatch a plan to establish a caliphate in Central Mindanao, according to the government.,The military demonstrated its force against their combined forces, deploying the brand new fighter jets of the air force for the first time to conduct surgical air strikes.,In the middle of military operations, President Rodrigo Duterte traveled to a town adjacent to Butig to plead to local leaders to shun the ISIS ideology. ,\"Alam ninyo \u2018yung Maute, if they are inspired doon sa ISIS, magkaleche-leche ang buhay natin ,(You know, if the Maute is inspired by ISIS, we will all be in trouble),\" Duterte said in a speech there. ,But his emissaries to the Maute Group failed to talk them out of their plans. ,When the clashes started in Marawi, Duterte immediately ,declared martial law in Mindanao,.,TROOP VISIT.

Photo by Carmela Fonbuena/Rappler ,The military thought Hapilon was severely wounded in Butig and perhaps dead. But he would show up in Marawi City on May 23. They raided the safe house in Barangay Basak Malutlut, where they found him, but failed yet again to snare him. ,What surprised them was the reaction of Marawi residents. The recruits of the Maute Brothers \u2013 supposed ISIS cells in the city \u2013 sprung out of the streets to conduct simultaneous attacks in the city. (READ: ,Marawi battle zone: Urban warfare challenges PH military,),While the military ran after the leaders, local politicians and their families took their guns to defend city hall and the capitol from the terrorists who wanted to raise the ISIS black flag there. ,A video seized from a safe house in Basak Malutlut shows Hapilon and the Maute Brothers planning an attack on Marawi. Armed Forces chief General Eduardo A\u00f1o said they wanted to seize the city and declare it an Islamic caliphate on the 1st day of Ramadan. The grand plan, he said, is to replicate how ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Bhagdadi took the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2014.,PLANNING THE ATTACK. Screenshot of a video the military recovered from a Maute safe house showing them planning an attack in Marawi City. ,The video also shows, according to A\u00f1o, that the Maute Brothers were on top of the operations even as they recognized Hapilon as the ISIS emir. ,A\u00f1o said that while the military raid failed to snag Hapilon on May 23, it succeeded in foiling their plan to seize Marawi City. ,The Marawi crisis has entered its 2nd month. On May 25, the Islamic city celebrated its saddest Eid celebration with most of its 200,000 residents away from their homes, some living in squalid evacuation centers. ,\u201cThis fighting brought by the local militant group robbed us of the chance to observe Ramadan peacefully and stole from us the opportunity to celebrate Eid\u2019l Fitr and to be with our loved ones on the religious occasion,\u201d said Zia Alonto Adiong, the spokesman of the crisis management committee.,As of Saturday, June 24, the clashes have killed at least 69 soldiers, 280 terrorists, and 26 civilians. Many houses have been bombed or burned. (READ: ,One month of Marawi clashes: Death toll now 375,),After Sanusi\u2019s death, the Maute family went into hiding in Butig because they were supposedly afraid they would be arrested for coddling the foreign terrorist, according to an intelligence report prepared after the Butig attacks.,The mountainous hometown of Farhana is where Camp Bushra is located, one of the biggest camps of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the country\u2019s dominant Muslim rebel group that has been fighting for self-rule in Mindanao.,Butig saw massive military operations in the 2000 all-out war waged by then president Joseph Estrada. It would enjoy relative quiet since the MILF began talks with the government to create a new Bangsamoro region envisioned to replace, and have more powers than, the existing ARMM.,The Maute Brothers would disturb this peace when they brought the war to Butig. The military offensives also destroyed houses, buildings, and government offices, as well as displaced thousands of residents.,The Maute family is well connected to the MILF hierarchy, but they have long opposed its leadership and the peace process it pushed.,Cayamora Maute, an engineer, previously served the MILF engineering bureau, according to an intelligence report. But it\u2019s Farhana who is practically royalty. She belongs to the distinguished political Romato clan, which intermarried with the Mimbantas who ruled the MILF for decades. ,The Maute brothers are the first cousins of Azisa Romato, the wife of the late MILF vice chairman for military affairs Abdulaziz Mimbantas. Mohammad Khayyam is also married to a Mimbantas daughter \u2013 it was in their house where Sanusi was killed, according to an intelligence report.,In Marawi, son Abdullah Maute is married to a sister of former mayor Pre Salic. Salic and his brother Omar \"Solitario\" Ali, also a former mayor, are among the politicians the government singled out for helping the Maute Brothers. They are facing charges of rebellion.,The links to influential families grew through marriages with families not only in Butig and Marawi but also in nearby Masiu, where Farhana sought refuge and was arrested at the height of the clashes.,These relations have triggered suspicions against the MILF despite the rebel group having cooperated with the military in its offensives.,But the positions are clear. The MILF has categorically opposed the ISIS ideology that the Maute Group promoted. ,The blood ties, however, have allowed the Maute Group to recruit among MILF clans, especially among the \u201csecond generation MILF\u201d or the children of its members \u201cdo not listen to their elders.\u201d,The Maute Group exploited the growing weariness of young Muslims over the continued failure of government to deliver on its promises pertaining to the peace process.,There were many of them in Butig, Marawi, and other places in Mindanao. Successive disappointments with government made them susceptible to the radical ideology of ISIS and the need to take their own territory where they could establish a caliphate in Mindanao.,TRAINING. Child soldiers are taught to kill early on. Rappler sourced photo       ,In Butig and in Marawi, Rappler interviews showed that the recruitment strategy was almost the same. They spoke with residents about their ideology. Those who appeared open to the teachings were invited to discuss the ideology further. At a certain stage they were made to swear on the Koran and vow secrecy.,\"Swearing on the Koran is sacred. You can't take your word back,\" said a Butig resident.,In Marawi, a lot of the recruitment was done on social media. In Butig, where there is no internet, it was face-to-face engagement. It was also in Butig where they brought fighters for training. ,They also recruited children based on the promise that they would allow them to study the Koran. They turned them into fighters instead. (READ: ,I met a Maute soldier. He's a child.,),Butig Mayor Jimmy Pansar said most of the fighters in Butig were not residents. ,\u201cKaramihan ng recruits from Marawi, Maguindanao, at Balik Islam.\u201d, (Most of the recruits were from Marawi, Maguindanao, and Islam converts.),In Marawi, the fighters of the Maute Group were given a boost by Abu Sayyaf fighters and foreign fighters who took advantage of a Tabligh convention of Sunni Islamic missionaries to fly to Marawi City. Tabligh Jamaat is said to be a movement that calls on Muslims to return to Sunni Islam, the world's largest religious denomination.,The military said the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and the Ansarul Khalifa Philippines of Sarangani, the two other ISIS-linked terrorist groups, planned to reinforce the fighters in Marawi. (READ: ,4 PH terror groups link up with pro-ISIS fighters in region,) ,When Pansar was elected after two Maute attacks in 2016, among the first things he did was meet with the residents of Butig to discourage them from joining the terrorist group. ,\u201cAfter my assumption, I met with religious leaders and stakeholders \u2013 in addition to municipal officials and barangay chairman \u2013 to explain to the population that what they are doing is wrong. Most of the residents understood that. It\u2019s not ,jihad,, 101% it\u2019s really wrong,\u201d Pansar told Rappler in an interview back in December.,He was 5 months into his term, in November 2016, when the Maute Group succeeded in raising the ISIS black flag in Butig. It\u2019s what the terrorist group also wanted to do in Marawi City. ,MOST WANTED. These photos of the Mautes are displayed in checkpoints in Lanao provinces. ,A common denominator between the group\u2019s biggest attack in Butig and the siege of Marawi City, according to residents, is this: the sitting mayors are not Maute allies.,\u201cFor me, this is not ,jihad,. They are after power and wealth by destroying the community,\u201d said Pansar.,The Maute has received foreign funding, mostly believed to have been coursed through Farhana. Malaysia's most wanted terrorist Mahmud Ahmad also channeled at least P30 million ($600,000) to finance the attack, according to A\u00f1o. ,Duterte himself had claimed that narco-politics helped fund the Maute Group, fitting the conflict into the narrative of his war on drugs. Residents are not dismissing this.,Here lies a truth about conflicts in Mindanao. Families join and support armed groups for various reasons \u2013 religion, pride, power, and wealth to name a few. It is dangerous to oversimplify the cause of conflict as one or another to fit a narrative that government wants to push.,Even the \"emir\" of ISIS in Southeast Asia, Isnilon Hapilon of the Abu Sayyaf Group, belongs to an organization that kidnaps foreign hostages to rake in millions of ransom money. Occasionally, it uses the ISIS black flag to up the group's international profile. But the Abu Sayyaf itself has too many factions and Hapilon is known to have kept some ideology despite the banditry of his group.,\"At the core of the Maute Group is the radical ideology supporting ISIS. They will not kill themselves for money or power alone,\" a local official told Rappler. ,Like the young Muslims tired of war, the MILF leadership itself has expressed disappointment over the slow progress of the peace talks under Duterte. But their actions showed commitment to the peace process.,In Butig, the MILF ordered its fighters to give way and not intervene with military operations. ,In Marawi, the MILF created \"peace corridors\" to assist trapped civilians trying to escape the war zone and help secure adjacent towns where the conflict could spill over.,As the battle rages in Marawi City, a new draft for a law that will create the Bangsamoro region has been submitted to Duterte. He is expected to endorse this to Congress when it resumes session in July,Peace advocates argue that the Marawi crisis underscores the need to complete the peace process with the MILF to prevent more young Muslims from taking matters into their own hands.,And while the military is confident they have defeated the terrorists in Marawi, the ISIS threat will not be obliterated even when the fighting in Marawi stops. As ISIS faces defeat and loses territory in the Middle East, the Asian fighters are expected to return and seek refuge back home.,A political solution to the Mindanao problem is urgent. There is no time to waste. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/173697-terrorism-mindanao-maute-family-marawi-city", "title": "Terror in Mindanao: The Mautes of Marawi", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/nation/16677-military-says-indonesian-militant-killed,http://www.rappler.com/nation/154262-philippine-flag-replaces-isis-banner-butig-town-hall"},

Check yourself using these 12 questions.    ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Don't know if your house will collapse during an earthquake? A new tool allows you to check for yourself.,Launched, by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \"How Safe is My House? Self-check for Earthquake Safety\" is a 12-point questionnaire homeowners can use to assess the earthquake readiness of their house.,The checklist was tailored for concrete hollow block (CHB) houses, one of the most common types of Philippine homes because of its low construction cost. See the complete document ,here,.,The features recommended by the checklist are based on the National Buiding Code and Structural Code of the Philippines. They were tested by a full-scale shaking table experiment conducted by Filipino and Japanese experts. ,Phivolcs plans to launch a version for a wooden house as well as a computer simulation program to enable enginners and architects to test the earthquake readiness of their designs using special software.,The higher the total score, the more earthquake-resistant the house:,The features,An \"earthquake-resistant\" house is a house that will not collapse even in the face of an intensity 9 earthquake, said Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum.,So what makes a house earthquake-resistant?,A house designed by a civil engineer or architect instead of a mason or carpenter has a higher chance of not collapsing because the expert is expected to follow the Building Code and Structural Code.,A house built in 1992 or after is also more earthquake-ready because it was the year after more earthquake resistance standards were introduced to the codes.,A regular-shaped house \u2013 symmetrical, rectangular, box-type \u2013 is also more stable than an irregularly-shaped house. ,\"The shape influences the behavior of the building during ground shaking. If it's irregular, the house will be twisted and various parts will move in various ways, so it's not good,\" explained Solidum., ,The building materials used also determine the strength of the house. Walls made of 6-inch (150 mm) thick concrete hollow blocks are much stronger than the cheaper but more commonly used 4-inch blocks.,The reinforcement of vertical and steel bars embedded in the walls are just as important. Vertical bars have to have a diameter of 10 mm and must be only 40 centimeters away from each other. Many substandard homes have thinner bars (6 mm) spaced farther away from each other (90 cm).,For horizontal bars, they must be 10 mm thick and spaced 60 cm from each other (or between 3 layers of concrete hollow blocks). ,Walls that are more than 3 meters wide must be supported to prevent it from falling down during a quake. ,COMMON HOUSE. Concrete hollow block (CHB) houses are common in the Philippines because they are cheap and easy to construct. Photo from PHIVOLCS,Many Filipino homes also have a gable wall, or the triangular area between the A-frame of the roof and the wall around the house. To keep the gable wall from falling (as it did in the video), materials for it must be light. If it's made of concrete hollow blocks, they must be well-anchored to the rest of the house. Houses with no gable wall are far safer. Examples of these are houses with flat roofs.,A foundation of reinforced concrete would resist the shaking of an earthquake making it the ideal foundation for a house. This much more stable than a foundation of stones or unreinforced concrete. ,The kind of soil on which the house is built is another factor. Rock or stiff soil is more stable while muddy or reclaimed soil literally puts your house on shaky ground.,The last important gauge is the overall condition of the house. A well-maintained house with damages from previous earthquakes or other calamities repaired stands a much better chance of surviving a quake than a deteriorated one. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Being situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is no stranger to earthquakes.

It was considered an active volcano since 1987 mainly because of the Carbon 14 date showing it last erupted around 600 years ago.,When Phivolcs raised an ,alert warning, for a possible eruption of Mt Pinatubo in April 1991, there were some who did not believe it because of the \u201clack of experienced eruption,\u201d Solidum said.,Active volcanoes, no matter how many years they \u201crest\u201d are still capable of  devastating eruptions.,\u201cIf a volcano is classified as active, people should be prepared for a possible activity even if the volcano has not erupted in their lifetime,\u201d Solidum explained.,Hard to predict,The Phivolcs\u2019 mandate is to mitigate disasters that may arise from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis and other related geotectonic phenomena.

Sudden gas-driven explosions may take place anytime within this area, which is within the 6-kilometer radius around the volcano.,\u201cIdeally, there should be no permanent settlement allowed. Entry inside PDZ allowed if [a volcano is] at Alert Level 0, but climbers to summit [are] at risk to steam driven explosion and should take precaution,\u201d Solidum explained.,So far, there are 4 other active volcanoes in the Philippines with PDZs: Taal (whole island), Kanlaon and Bulusan (4 km) and Hibok-Hibok (3 km). These volcanoes frequently erupt, Solidum said.,He added that those living near a volcano should be updated about its condition based on Phivolcs monitoring.

UAE would be the sixth country the 38-year-old has fought in., ,Pacquiao, the current WBO welterweight titleholder and Philippine senator, is expected to face Australian Jeff Horn, an unbeaten but relatively unknown fighter who is rated number two in the 147-pound division by the WBO.,Pacquiao had told Rappler ,it was his \"first time\" to hear Horn's name,, when asked if he was previously familiar with the Australian fighter (16-0-1, 11 knockouts). Horn would be Pacquiao's first opponent in 10 years who is not a former or current world champion.,Emails to Koncz and Pacquiao's promoter Top Rank were not answered by the time of this story's publication. An attempt to call Koncz on Sunday afternoon went straight to voicemail.,Dean Lonergan, the CEO of Horn's promoter Duco Events, contested the developments, telling ,Courier Mail, he had been discussing with Top Rank CEO Bob Arum for \"many weeks\" to bring the fight to the 52,500-capacity Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, Australia, which is Horn's hometown.,\"The only person authorized to promote Manny Pacquiao is Bob Arum,\" said Lonergan.,\"Until Bob Arum tells me differently we are continuing with that aim of having the fight at Suncorp Stadium on April 23.\",In a story on BoxingScene, Koncz apologized to the Australian government, which had lobbied strongly to host Pacquiao's next fight.,\"We have executed the agreement in the morning and 100% the fight will he here in the UAE,\" Koncz is quoted as saying.,\"It took us a while to get this deal together,\" he added. \"There was a lot of confusion whether this is going to happen here in the UAE. [But] I'm here with full authority and power.\",Horn's manager Glenn Rushton ,told Rappler weeks ago, that his side would prefer the fight take place in Australia but added, \",We'll fight on the moon if we have to.\" \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Ryan Songalia is the sports editor of Rappler, a member of the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA), and a contributor to The Ring magazine.

This is contrary to the stance taken by government at the time, under former president Benigno Aquino III: there is ,no ISIS in the Philippines.,Here are some of the other things Calida said about ISIS in his consolidated comment ,uploaded online, by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG).

On December 5, 2009, then president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared martial law in Maguindanao through Proclamation 1959, following the ,massacre of 58 people, \u2013 mostly members of the media \u2013 in the town of Ampatuan.,She lifted it 7 days later on December 12, 2009 upon the recommendation of the Cabinet.,Duterte is the 3rd president to declare martial law since after the war.,Proclamation 1081, which placed the entire Philippines under Martial Law was signed by former president Ferdinand Marcos on September 21, 1972. On September 23, at exactly 7:15 pm, he appeared on television to formally announce it. ,Marcos cited the  increasing threat of communism to justify the declaration. ,Meanwhile, according to ,Marcos\u2019 diary entry for September 22, 1972,, the alleged ambush of then defense secretary Juan Ponce Enrile made the \u201cmartial law proclamation a necessity.\u201d,There were reports that the ambush was staged, as claimed by Oscar Lopez and his family who lived near the area where it happened. Enrile, in his 2014 memoir and documentary, insisted that it was all real. Yet the Official Gazette says that in 1986, Enrile himself disclosed that the supposed ambush was staged to justify Martial Law. (READ: ,Enrile's tale: Hypocrisy and contradictions,),It was the start of almost 10 years of martial rule in the country.,Aside from Proclamation 1081, Marcos also released general orders (GO) that guided his martial rule. (READ: ,Marcos\u2019 Martial Law orders,),Included were orders to transfer all powers to the president, authorizing the military to arrest individuals conspiring to take over the government, the enforcement of curfew hours, and the banning of group assemblies.,Letters of instruction were also released in the following days, ordering the closure and seizure of private media and public utilities, among others.,Marcos formally ended Martial Law through ,Proclamation No. 2045 ,on January 17, 1981. ,Five years after ending Martial Law, Marcos was toppled from power through the 1986 People Power Revolution. Corazon Aquino, the widow of Marcos critic Benigno Aquino Jr, ascended to the presidency. ,In April 1986, through Proclamation No. 9, Aquino created the 1986 Constitutional Commission (Con-Com) which was responsible for drafting a replacement for the 1973 constitution. (FAST FACTS: ,The 1987 Philippine Constitution,),The new constitution, she said, should be \u201ctruly reflective of the aspirations and ideals of the Filipino people.\u201d,Unlike the ,1935 Constitution ,which Marcos based his proclamation on, the 1987 Philippine Constitution was more explicit on when Martial Law can be declared.,Section 18, Article VII of the ,1987 Philippine Constitution, says that the President, as commander-in-chief, may \u201cin case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it\u201d suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the country under martial law.,The martial law period or suspension of the writ of habeas corpus should, however, not exceed 60 days. The writ safeguards individual freedom against arbitrary state action.,Unlike the previous constitutions, the 1987 Philippine Constitution specifies that a state of martial law cannot override the function of both the judiciary and legislative branches of the government.,The latest constitution also does not \u201cauthorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function.\",A state of martial law does not automatically suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.,Its suspension shall only apply to \"persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with the invasion.\",During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, those arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within 3 days, or otherwise released.,Under the latest constitution, other branches of government have a say in the declaration of martial law to prevent grave abuse of discretion on the part of the chief executive.,The 1987 Philippine Constitution says that the declaration shall be affirmed by the Congress via a vote and even reviewed by the Supreme Court.,Within 48 hours after its declaration, the president shall submit a report \u201cin person or in writing\u201d to Congress.,Congress then has the power to revoke the proclamation by a vote of at least a majority of all members of both the Senate and the House. Congress can also \u2013 if requested by the President and if public safety requires it \u2013 extend the period of Martial Law beyond the mandated 60 days.,The Supreme Court, meanwhile, may review the \u201csufficiency of the factual basis\u201d of the proclamation of Martial Law in an \u201cappropriate proceeding filed by any citizen.\u201d ,There are people who laud the Martial Law period in the Philippines, claiming that it was the \u201cbest years\u201d of the country.,However, the supposed discipline that existed then was accompanied by the numerous abuses people suffered through. (READ: ,#NeverAgain: Martial Law stories young people need to hear,),According to ,Amnesty International,, about 70,000 people were imprisoned while 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed during Martial Law from 1972 to 1981. ,People deemed to be subversive were tortured by various means, including electrocution, water cure, and strangulation.

JICA Chief Representative Sasaki Takahiro (right in suit) and PHIVOLCS Director Renato Solidum unveil the 12-point earthquake safety checklist on February 19, 2014. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Is your house ready for the next big earthquake?,A new tool for assessing the earthquake readiness of Philippine houses was launched on Wednesday, February 19 by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).,The tool is a checklist that homeowners themselves can use to find out whether or not their house will collapse in the event of an earthquake.,The guide, with the title \"How Safe is My House? Self-check for Earthquake Safety of Concrete Hollow Block Houses in the Philippines,\" specifically looks into the features of a concrete hollow block (CHB) house, one of the most common types of houses in the Philippines because of its affordable construction cost. Read the checklist ,here,.,The team behind the earthquake safety checklist went around the entire country assessing the performance of CHB houses during recent earthquakes like the ,October 15 7.2-magnitude quake, in Bohol.,They found out that many of these houses were not designed according to the Building Code and Structural Code of the Philippines, which stipulates guidelines on building an earthquake-resistant house. Most of the time, especially in the country's poorest communities, these houses are built by the village carpenter or mason who sometimes do not know the government building standards.,Substandard buildings and structures are a major cause of death during earthquakes, said Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum.,\"If we can reduce the collapse of houses or damage to houses we will significantly reduce deaths due to earthquake.\",Checking for readiness,An earthquake-resistant house is a house that will not collapse during an intensity 8 earthquake, said Solidum. (READ: ,MAP: Strongest earthquakes in the Philippines,),The Do-It-Yourself checklist notes down the features a CHB house must have for it to be earthquake-resistant. These features are specific \u2013 everything from the thickness of the concrete hollow blocks used to the kind of soil the house should be built on.,The checklist asks homeowners to see if their homes have all the right features. One point is given for every earthquake-resistant feature in the house. If the feature is missing or the homeowner does not know if the feature exists, a score of zero is given for that item. ,The higher the total score, the higher the level of earthquake readiness.,To further test the recommended features, Filipino and Japanese experts conducted a full-scale shaking table experiment in Japan using concrete hollow blocks and other building materials from the Philippines.,True enough, the house with all the features imposed by the Building Code and Structural Code (Model A) fared better than the house (Model B) that did not follow the standards.,Watch the video of the experiment here:,But a house with all the right components is not completely safe from any damage, emphasized Solidum.,The homeowner should still prepare for falling debris. They should still protect their heads and necks or hide beneath a sturdy table. If possible, it would be safer to run outside in an area clear of tall objects or structures. ,Laymanized,An attempt at \"laymanizing\" disaster preparedness, the self-check tool aims to link regular Filipinos with the science of earthquake resilience. ,But does the tool oversimplify the matter and make Filipinos complacent with their houses? What if human error in checking the features leads to a fatal mistake?,Solidum emphasized that no matter what score attained, homeowners are instructed to consult a civil engineer or architect. He allayed fears that this would be costly to the homeowner, because citizens can tap local government engineers to provide the expertise.,PHIVOLCS has also partnered with the Association of Structural Engineers of the Philippines (ASEP) to provide a two-day workshop in various parts of the country open to all homeowners. The workshop will teach participants how to use the earthquake safety checklist and will allow them to consult with engineers on how to retrofit their homes if they are found to be unsafe.,The reality is that many poor Filipinos build their own houses, he said. The checklist is one way Filipinos can make sure the homes they do build on their own or with their village carpenter or mason conform to safe standards.,Solidum hopes to reach all Filipino households with the help of the Department of Interior Local Government (DILG) who, during the launch, committed to spreading a circular to all local government units about the checklist.,\"We will also develop a 12-point questionnaire for a wooden house and we will also prepare the Tagalog version. We have to be very careful in using the right Tagalog words because some of these are engineering terms,\" said Solidum.,A computer simulation software that will allow engineers to test their designs in various earthquake scenarios is also in the works. The software is based on field data, experiments and the Structural and Building Codes. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/50979-earthquake-safety-checklist-houses", "title": "Tool to check earthquake readiness of PH houses launched", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/152898-marcos-burial-military-preparations,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/100151-can-your-house-withstand-major-earthquakes,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/preparedness/50984-checklist-earthquake-ready-house,http://www.rappler.com/nation/41372-central-bohol-earthquake"},

The rebel was hit by a splinter in his leg.,In a phone interview, Mama said the Army suddenly moved its forces and equipment to Datu Piang town, firing mortars and 105mm howitzer cannons. \"Our base is far away from where their artillery are landing but we will attack the soldiers once they come closer to our position,\" Mama said.,He added that many civilians have already left their homes to seek safer ground.,As of posting, military officials said soldiers have stepped up their operations against BIFF units in Datu Piang.,Regional military spokesman Dickson Hermoso told Agence France-Presse the attacks were launched in a bid to arrest about 25 leaders of the BIFF.,As of 6:50 pm Monday, Hermoso said two rebels were killed in the offensive. Mama denied this, saying they were merely wounded. ,Hermoso said the MILF was helping the military. \"The MILF are part of the law enforcement operations. They are just securing their communities so those (BIFF fighters) cannot enter. They are also angry at the BIFF,\" he told AFP.,MILF military spokesman Von al-Haq confirmed that the military had coordinated with the MILF before the attack. \"The BIFF cannot enter (our territories.) We have a line where we have re-positioned (personnel). If they run there, they cannot enter there unless they are surrendering,\" he told AFP.,'Spoilers',Led by former 105th Base Commander Ameril Umra Kato, the BIFF splintered from the MILF after serious disagreements on the conduct of the peace negotiations with the government.,The government and the MILF peace panels hurdled the final obstacle to a peace agreement with the signing on Saturday, January 25, of the annex on how to deal with the rebels and their firearms.

Malaca\u00f1ang file photo ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 With President Rodrigo Duterte's ,declaration of martial law, in Mindanao, all eyes are now on Congress, authorized by the 1987 Constitution to review the proclamation.,Article 7, Section 18 requires the President to submit a report within 48 hours of declaration to Congress, which has the power to either revoke or extend it through joint voting.,But unlike in 2009, when Congress deliberated on then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s proclamation of martial law, the Senate and the House of Representatives are now lukewarm to the idea of convening both chambers. Not necessary, not required, no opposition, they said.,In December 2009, a joint public session was convened at least thrice after Arroyo, who was then suffering from negative public ratings, declared martial law in Maguindano following the ,Maguindanao massacre,.,The marathon deliberations, lasting several hours, were dominated by questions from opposition lawmakers against the proclamation.,But now, Congress, filled with administration allies, is so far keen on virtually letting the popular president off the hook with his ,Proclamation No. 216,, declaring martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao after government clashes with the Maute Group in Marawi City.,Congress leaders even said it is \",unlikely,\" for Congress to revoke Duterte's proclamation.,\u201cWhy would they want a joint session when it is not necessary, not needed, not really called for? It\u2019s not necessary at all except [for] media mileage,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III in a text message to Rappler.,House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and Majority Leader Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as earlier said there won\u2019t be any joint session to discuss the proclamation.,\u201cNatanggap po namin yung written report ng ating Pangulo kagabi.

The report details Duterte\u2019s grounds for his declaration, citing threats from the ,terrorist group Islamic State (ISIS),. (LOOK: ,Duterte's report to Congress on martial law,),In lieu of a joint public session, the Senate and the House of Representatives are eyeing ,separate closed-door briefings, on Monday, May 29, with national security officials.,2009 v 2017: What\u2019s the difference?,Following the massacre of 57 people in Maguindanao led by the powerful Ampatuan clan, Arroyo placed Maguindanao under martial law in December 2009.,File photo by AFP ,She also suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the province except \"for certain areas\", thus enabling the military to make arrests without court intervention.,It was the first declaration of martial law in the country since 1972 under dictator Ferdinand Marcos. It was also the first covered by the 1987 Constitution, which was crafted precisely to prevent grave abuse and prevent another Marcos from tinkering with civil rights.,The 1987 Philippine Constitution says that the President, as commander-in-chief, may \u201cin case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it\u201d suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the country under martial law. The writ safeguards individuals against arbitrary arrest.,Arroyo\u2019s Proclamation No. 1959 was meant to deal with the reported rebellion of forces loyal to the Ampatuan family after its members were implicated in the massacre.,Arroyo lifted the declaration after only 8 days, before Congress \u2013 then with a mounting opposition to her \u2013 scheduled the vote on the matter.,At the time, Arroyo\u2019s trust and satisfaction ratings were at an all-time low (,-38 net satisfaction rating,), as her administration was hounded with legitimacy and corruption issues. She was even the \",most distrusted,\" government official then, according to surveys.,The proclamation and deliberation also happened a few months before the May 2010 presidential elections, with some lawmakers eyeing reelection or other posts.,In Duterte\u2019s case, his declaration coincided with his, high popularity and satisfaction ratings,. ,Asked why the change in Congress' move, Sotto, Duterte's ally, said the conditions under the Arroyo and Duterte administrations are different.,\u201cThe threat during GMA\u2019s time could have been addressed surgically while the threat today could have national and international implications if not addressed with decisiveness and strong will,\u201d Sotto said.,\u201cThe Maute Group could be associated with ISIS and that is the last thing we would want to happen to our country. Those opposing should realize that there are enough safeguards in the Constitution available to us in case of abuse,\u201d he added.,But with Duterte's repeated mention of martial law even before his actual proclamation and his supposed ,human rights record,, some have raised concerns about possible abuses. (READ: ,Ramos fears 'more harmful' martial law under Duterte,),\"The Constitution provides for transparency, accountability, as well as the right of the citizen to information of public interest. And obviously, all these 3 are necessary, especially the declaration of martial law is a serious matter. Millions are affected because the declaration is for the whole Mindanao,\" said minority Senator Francis Pangilinan, Liberal Party president, in a mix of Filipino and English.,Pangilinan, also a senator in 2009, recalled that the Senate then, filled with Arroyo critics, passed a resolution with at least 17 senators calling for a joint session. ,Shielding a popular president?,But times now seem to have changed. Under the Arroyo administration, Congress had the advantage over her, according to political analyst Aries Arugay.,After all, it was Congress that \"helped Arroyo become president\" despite issues against her administration following the \"Hello Garci\" scandal. Arroyo also had to \u201ckeep the wheels of patronage well-oiled\u201d at the time because of impeachment threats against her.,\u201cIn 2009, Congress had the upper hand since GMA was suffering a legitimacy deficit,\u201d Arugay told Rappler in an interview.,On the other hand, Duterte became president despite the absence of Congress\u2019 support. This fact is not lost on the Chief Executive himself after he told lawmakers in his first State of the Nation Address that he owes them nothing because they supported other bets in the 2016 polls.,Congress at present, Arugay said, serves as the \"protector\" of the President, who still enjoys wide public support. Convening Congress, in short, would \u201cexpose\u201d the President to scrutiny.,\u201cCongress under Duterte is acting more like a legislative shield. Instead of checking executive power, the legislature protects the president from existential threats,\u201d Arugay said.,\u201cThe President still is very popular and still has budgetary powers, not to mention the patronage resources from PDP-Laban,\u201d he added, referring to Duterte\u2019s party, whose membership has ballooned since he took office.,With a popular president, a politician faces the risk of a backlash if he goes a different path.,\u201cDuterte can say they are preventing him from doing his job. It will appear that they are against security and order. Do you really think Congress wants to be painted as preventing actions against terrorists?\u201d Arugay said.,\u201cOn matters of national security, politics stops at the water's edge. This age-old adage is more relevant under a Duterte presideny who is fighting wars in multiple fronts,\u201d he added, referring to lawmakers' aim for survival.,After all, the present choices of lawmakers might haunt them soon, or in two years, during the 2019 midterm elections. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/171096-no-joint-session-congress-martial-law-duterte", "title": "No joint session on martial law?

The nutritional status of mothers before and during pregnancy can have short-term and long-term impacts on their children. Photo by Akira Liwanag/EPA,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Philippines is the 5,th, country in the world with the most cases of low birthweight infants, according to a 2013 report by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (Unicef).,This is a consequence of poor nutrition among women before and during pregnancy.,The World Health Organization (WHO) says that low birthweight babies are at more risk of health problems manifested not only during early development stages but also until adulthood.,If this trend persists, not only women and children are put in peril, but also the entire country\u2019s future workforce. ,The lack of investment in women\u2019s health may result in a weak, sickly, and dull population, ultimately putting a strain on the Philippine economy, education, and development.,At present, it seems that the long road to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 \u2013 including the improvement of women\u2019s and children\u2019s health \u2013 will be a bumpy one.,Double responsibility, ,\u201cThe health and survival of mothers and their newborns are linked,\u201d Unicef stressed.,A pregnant woman must satisfy not only her own nutritional requirements but also those of the growing fetus in her womb.,Her nutritional status affects her child\u2019s health at birth. This crucial period can also determine growth and development in the years to come.,All of the baby\u2019s nutrition needs come from the mother. ,Insufficient nutrition could lead to different problems such as stunting which refers not only to hindered physical growth, but also to impaired cognitive abilities. Stunting refers to having a lower height for one's age and is caused by long-term insufficient nutrient intake. It occurs before the age of two and its effects are irreversible.,Unicef reported that 80% of the world\u2019s stunted children live in 14 countries, among which the Philippines ranked No. 9,. ,As of 2011, 33.6% of Filipino children under 5 years old were stunted., ,During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body prioritizes the baby\u2019s nutrition needs.,For example, if the mother is anemic, her hemoglobin count may further drop since the baby inside her also needs hemoglobin for oxygenation. This may compromise the health of both mother and baby.,Unicef advises mothers to receive micronutrient supplements, extra food and fluids \u201cto rebuild their own nutrient stores.\u201d,Pregnant women should focus on their health and nutrition needs to prevent difficult labor and complications such as severe hemorrhage, infections, high blood pressure, and abscesses of the breasts, according to the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (FNRI-DOST).,Pregnant and nutritionally at risk ,In the Philippines, one out of every 4 pregnant women is nutritionally at risk, ,FNRI-DOST reported in its most recent survey in 2011.,Close to one-fourth or 23.5% of pregnant mothers with children 0-5 years old are also at risk and 11.8% of lactating mothers are underweight, the same survey said.,AT RISK. 1/4 of all pregnant Filipino women are nutritionally at risk. Source: FNRI-DOST Updating of NNS 2011,These figures barely changed in the past decade, reflecting the country\u2019s slow progress in improving the health and nutritional status of pregnant women., ,Poorly nourished mothers will also most likely give birth to low birthweight infants \u2013 those weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth.,Low birth weight,LOW BIRTHWEIGHT. The Philippines ranks 5th in the world for having the most cases of low birthweight infants. Source: UNICEF Global Nutrition Database 2012,The incidence of low birthweight exceeded 20% in the Philippines; the same was observed in India and Pakistan, according to Unicef. ,The figure is alarming, considering that these unhealthy infants will someday grow to be our society\u2019s backbone.,This can also have adverse effects on the economy. WHO suggests that low birth weight results in \u201csubstantial costs to the health sector and imposes a significant burden on society as a whole.\u201d,According to FNRI-DOST, 20.2% of Filipino children under 5 years old were underweight in 2011. The MDG target is to reduce this number to 17.3% in 2015. The probability of the Philippines achieving this goal is said to be \"medium.\",The Philippines is the 10,th, country in the world most affected by wasting or having low weight for one\u2019s height. Wasting is an acute form of malnutrition and increases the risk of death among children.,In 2011, 7.3% of Filipino children under 5 years old suffered from wasting.,Making the right food choices,Milagrina Jacinto, president of the Department of Health (DOH) League of Licensed Nutritionist-Dietitians Inc. and head of the Nutrition and Dietetics Service of the Quirino Memorial Medical Center (QMMC), emphasized the importance of eating the right quality and quantity of food during pregnancy.,\u201cPregnancy is a crucial period. The mother is not only feeding herself, but also the baby inside her womb,\u201d Jacinto said.,Jacinto clarified the misconception that eating healthy means spending more money. \u201cIn terms of quality, it doesn\u2019t mean you eat the most expensive food. For example, you can substitute meat with other protein-rich foods such as legumes like ,monggo,, or with tofu, eggs, or fish. The nutrients are important, not the price.\u201d,Families may grow fruits, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables such as ,kangkong, malunggay,, and sweet potatoes in their backyards. These simple yet nutritious foods can contribute to the strengthening of the immune system.,Giving pregnant mothers food and micronutrients would improve their nutritional status as well as store the micronutrients necessary for their fetuses and eventually, their newborns.,Well-informed, well-nourished,A well-informed and well-nourished mother can better nourish her baby.,Education also plays a vital role in keeping a country healthy. Everyone, not just mothers, must be aware of their nutrition needs as well as the simplest and best ways to meet those needs.,Jacinto said government hospitals, like QMMC, offer free programs that educate pregnant women, such as counseling services, one-on-one consultations with nutritionist-dietitians, and forums and lectures on pregnancy, health and nutrition.,Because hospitals and LGUs vary in the free services they offer, the public must not hesitate to ask what these programs are.,Pregnant women, Jacinto added, should inquire about maternal care programs, antenatal care, post-partum care, immunizations, feeding programs, micronutrient supplementations, and other services available in their community.,The government, together with schools, local government units (LGUs), the media, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private sectors, and the general public must work together in raising health and nutrition awareness, Jacinto said. ,\u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/48039-hunger-during-pregnancy", "title": "Hungry and pregnant in the Philippines", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/33688-survey-pregnant-mothers-nutrition-risk"},

(READ: ,Tacloban: In the jaws of a 'climate sandwich',),Budget Secretary Florencio Abad said among the significant releases from the P17.7 billion were the following:,\"One of the more critical components in long-term rehabilitation is the provision of adequate shelter assistance, particularly to families whose houses were formerly situated in high-risk, disaster prone areas. Several of those who unfortunately perished during the super typhoon were living in very vulnerable areas. We want to prevent future calamities from reaching the scale of Yolanda's tragic aftermath by rebuilding communities on safer ground,\" Abad said. ,Beneficiaries of the assistance for permanent housing will be determined with the help of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau. These are families that used to live in areas wiped out by storm surges, and which government scientists have since classified as no-build zones. (READ: ,Leyte fishermen say no to no-build zone,) ,The budget chief also said: \"Some of the more crucial releases we made were directed towards the restoration of basic public services, such as the rebuilding of power generation, distribution, and transmission systems, as well as the reestablishment of clean water supplies. The restoration of these services was especially time-sensitive, as the continued well-being of survivors were especially dependent on how quickly we could bring the power and water supply back up.\u201d (READ: ,Aquino on Yolanda rehab: 'Build back better',),Besides the P17.7 billion released for various infrastructure and services to the communities, the budget department also rolled out a total of P3.1 billion in December for the immediate rehabilitation of the severely damaged Tacloban Airport in Leyte.,\u201cThe extent to which the typhoon struck down economic activity in several parts of the Visayas will have serious implications on the country's growth agenda, far beyond the limits of Yolanda's destructive path,\u201d Abad said, so these will be addressed in the public expenditure in 2014.

One year later, former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr continues to challenge the victory of Vice President Leni Robredo in the May 2016 elections. ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It's been a year since election day, and also a year since the country saw one of the most nail-biting vice presidential races to date.,Then-Camarines Sur 3rd District representative Leni Robredo, ,a reluctant politician, thrust into the national limelight, went up against then-senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr, son and namesake of the late strongman.,Robredo won by only a slim margin. On the eve of Robredo's oath-taking, Marcos ,filed an election protest,, claiming there was massive cheating in the polls.,Aside from dealing with the election protest, Robredo has had other challenges in her first year as vice president \u2013 she ,resigned, from the Duterte Cabinet, faced ,online attacks and rumors,, and is now the subject of ,draft impeachment complaints,.,Marcos, as he insists that the vice presidency was ,\"stolen\" from him,, has been visiting loyalists around the country to thank them for their support during the elections. Even out of office, the former senator updates the public about his activities on social media.,With Robredo and Marcos' legal battle far from over, the two rivals continue to cross paths. Here are the key moments in their election case:,May 6, 2016, \u2013 Marcos first ,floated the idea of cheating, in the elections during his miting de avance in Mandaluyong City, where he questioned Robredo's topping the ,ABS-CBN's survey, conducted by Pulse Asia. Other polls at the time showed the two were in a statistical tie., , , ,May 10 to 11, 2016, \u2013 At around 3:40 am of May 10, ,Robredo grabbed the top spot from Marcos, in the partial and unofficial canvassing of votes. Shortly after, Marcos' representatives called for a news conference and insinuated that Robredo and the Liberal Party rigged the elections.,The Marcos camp sustained their ,allegations against Robredo,, saying that the transparency server of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) was tampered with, as proven by the change in the ,hash code,. This opened debates on the infamous hash code issue and statistical explanations on Robredo's surge over Marcos.,Robredo, from the start, denied the cheating allegations. The ,Comelec also explained ,that the altered script was only due to a cosmetic change for names with \"\u00f1\" appearing with a \"?\".,May 20 to 24, 2016, \u2013 Marcos' representatives, former Abakada representative Jonathan dela Cruz and lawyer Amor Amorado, filed a ,series of complaints ,before the Comelec, seeking an explanation for the script change. They also filed a criminal case against Smartmatic and Comelec representatives before the Manila Prosecutor's Office for allegedly violating the ,cybercrime law,., , , ,May 27, 2016, \u2013 Robredo emerged winner in, the official canvassing of votes,, coincidentally on the birthday of her late husband, former interior secretary Jesse Robredo.,June 29, 2016, \u2013 Marcos ,filed an election protest versus Robredo, before the Supreme Court (SC), sitting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET). He contested the results in 27 cities and provinces, covering 39,221 \"clustered\" precincts which are composed of 132,446 \"established\" precincts. He also sought the nullification of votes in Basilan, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur, where massive poll fraud allegedly occurred.,Robredo was sworn in a day after, on June 30, 2016. , ,July 12, 2016, \u2013 The PET ordered the Comelec to ,safeguard all poll materials, in all 92,509 clustered precincts used in the May elections. It also directed Robredo to file her response to Marcos' election protest.,August 15, 2016 ,\u2013 Robredo ,filed her response and a counter-protest,. In her response, the Vice President asked the SC to junk Marcos' protest since the change in the hash code did not affect the election results.,Her lawyers, Romulo Macalintal and Bernadette Sardillo, also argued that Marcos' camp failed to specify how the alleged cheating happened and failed to show evidence of cheating in the Mindanao provinces where he wants votes nullified.,On the same day, the Marcos camp filed a manifestation on the Comelec's proposal to strip vote-counting machines (VCMs) and laptops of election data. The former senator's camp argued that this violated the PET order to preserve election paraphernalia., ,  , ,September 28, 2016, \u2013 Manila City Prosecutor Edward Togonon junked the cybercrime complaint filed by the Marcos camp over the hash code controversy. The case was dismissed for lack of merit and insufficiency of evidence. ,October to November 2016, \u2013 The Comelec began returning 1,356 leased VCMs to Smartmatic on October 27 despite Marcos' earlier manifestations before the PET, opposing the move. The Comelec had told the PET on October 22 that these were unused VCMs that were given to the poll body for contingency.,The Comelec also started data stripping in its warehouse in Sta Rosa, Laguna on October 26. Data were found in these supposedly unused SD cards, prompting Marcos to ask the PET to order the Comelec to ,bare the SD cards' contents,.,January 20, 2017, \u2013 Marcos' lawyer ,urged the PET ,to move forward with the election protest by setting a preliminary conference where issues will be simplified.,February 16, 2017, \u2013 The PET declared Marcos' protest as sufficient in form and substance, and ,denied Robredo's appeal ,to junk Marcos' protest.,February 27, 2017 ,\u2013 Robredo filed a ,motion for reconsideration, on her junked appeal.,March 6, 2017, \u2013 Marcos' camp ,accused Robredo's lawyers, of delaying the proceedings. Macalintal has since denied this, saying that they are only correcting the irregularities in Marcos' protest.,April 10, 2017, \u2013 The PET ordered Marcos to pay P66 million and Robredo P15.43 million ,as service fees for the contested precincts,. Both were given until April 17 to settle the first installment \u2013 P36 million for Marcos and P8 million for Robredo. The second tranche \u2013 P30 million for Marcos and P7.5 million for Robredo \u2013 is due on July 14.,April 12, 2017, \u2013 Robredo's camp ,filed a motion,, asking the PET to defer their payment until an initial recount of votes has been done in 3 provinces to be identified by Marcos. They also argued that Marcos should pay for all the precincts since he is questioning the integrity of the whole automated elections system., ,  , ,April 17, 2017, \u2013 Despite the Marcos camp's earlier pronouncement that they would file a motion for reconsideration on the amount required of them, Marcos ,paid the first half, of the service fee. He said the money was pooled from ,resources of friends and supporters,.,April 20, 2017, \u2013 Marcos ,asked the SC, to junk Robredo's counter-protest over non-payment of her service fee.,April 25, 2017, \u2013 The ,PET ordered Robredo, to pay the P8-million fee on May 2.

What does this mean for local government units that oversee tasks as mandated by the ,Local Government Code of 1991,?,It depends on Duterte's report to Congress which is subject to approval through a majority vote.,The report is supposed to outline how Duterte plans to bring about peace and order through the proclamation, including coordination with local government units.,Ateneo de Manila University Political Science instructor Arjan Aguirre said that one thing is certain: Local chief executives \u2013 barangay captains, mayors, and governors \u2013 would have to yield majority of their powers to the national government.,These powers include their mandate to order or supervise local counterparts of national agencies such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to hasten the restoration of peace. For purposes of streamlining relief operations, these agencies could be the Department of Social Welfare and Development, and the Department of Health.,University of the Philippines National College of Public Administration and Governance Dean Maria Fe Villamejor-Mendoza added that the central government \"may restrict some of the movements and freedoms of regular citizens\u201d via curfews and travel bans.

The Philippine Constitution says martial law must not exceed 60 days.,Within 48 hours of the declaration, the President has to submit a report \"in person or in writing\" to Congress. The declaration may be revoked by a Congressional vote. Most legislators are allies of the President.,The Supreme Court may also review the basis of the declaration.,Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella earlier said martial law would last 60 days but Duterte himself said it could last up to a year.

There are 197 accused in the case, and 106 remain on trial before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 221. But one of the main suspects, Ampatuan clan patriarch Andal Ampatuan Sr, had already ,died in July 2015,.  ,Former president Benigno Aquino III drew flak for ,failing to act quickly, to resolve the case, with critics pointing out that he failed to do so within his 6-year term.

The prosecution has already rested its case, and it is now the turn of the defense to present its evidence-in-chief.,Of the 9 accused who were the subject of the first batch of defense FOEs resolved by the Court on June 13, 2016, only one is still presenting defense evidence.,The second batch of defense FOEs, with 45 of the accused involved, has been resolved on November 15, 2016.

Jeff Horn has emerged as a most unlikely candidate to fight Manny Pacquiao, but he's not overawed by the challenge. Photos from Horn/Pacquiao Facebooks ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Australian underdog Jeff Horn knows that many people have never heard his name before this month, but said that shouldn\u2019t be the reason why people discount his chances against Manny Pacquiao.,Horn, who is unbeaten but largely unknown outside of Australia, has been floated around as a possible opponent for the Filipino living legend, with Pacquiao\u2019s promoter and Horn\u2019s co-promoter Bob Arum scheduled to meet with Dean Lonergan of Duco Events on Tuesday (Wednesday Manila time) to discuss the possibility of a fight in Australia for April 23.,Horn\u2019s hometown of Brisbane, which holds the 52,500-capacity SunCorp Stadium, and Sydney had been mentioned as possible sites. Arum tweeted out earlier on Monday, January 9, that, aside from Australia, offers had also come in from Russia, United Kingdom and the United States to host a Pacquiao fight.,\u201cIf you hear a name that you\u2019ve never heard before thrown into the mix of these big fights, it\u2019s only natural to go \u2018Who the hell is this guy? I\u2019ve never heard of him,\u2019\u201d said Horn (16-0-1, 11 knockouts), the number two ranked contender for Pacquiao\u2019s WBO welterweight title.,\u201cI think I\u2019m ready. Ever since I first started fighting I\u2019ve jumped in the deep end straight away. This is no different for me. I can remember going to an Australian title fight before I\u2019d even started fighting and saying \u2018I reckon I beat these guys.\u2019\u201d,Horn, an Olympic quarterfinalist at the 2012 Games who holds a Bachelor of Education degree to teach secondary school from Griffith University, has built his 4-year pro career against aging veterans like Randall Bailey, Naoufel Ben Rabeh and Ali Funeka, the latter of whom Horn finished in 6 rounds last month in New Zealand as Arum watched on.,Horn\u2019s resume\u2019 pales significantly in comparison with Pacquiao (59-6-2, 38 KOs), an 8-division champion whose last 18 opponents had been former or current world champions. Horn is 3 inches taller than Pacquiao at 5-foot-9 and 10 years younger at 28.,A fight with Horn would also present Pacquiao with an opportunity to hit reset on free television after dwindling pay-per-view numbers saw him sell a reported 400,000 units for a third clash with Timothy Bradley Jr in April of 2016 and 300,000 for his most recent fight against Jessie Vargas in November of 2016.,Bigger than Manny,\u201cI think I\u2019ve got the advantage on the physical side because I\u2019m bigger than Manny. He\u2019s come up from such light weight divisions. But he\u2019s shown obviously that he can take down guys even my size,\u201d said Horn.,\u201cI think I\u2019ve got the speed, I\u2019ve got a similar style to his so I\u2019m a good mover. It\u2019s gonna be harder for him to lay those shots on me because he\u2019s fought a few guys that don\u2019t move as well.\u201d,Australia has served as a legends graveyard in recent years with Shane Mosley, Roy Jones Jr and others having lost there. Horn doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s getting a faded version of Pacquiao after watching his one-sided decision win over Vargas.,\u201cI think Pacquiao\u2019s still right up there. He hasn\u2019t lost much from where he was in his prime. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve got him at a really good time. He\u2019s still world champion, he still beat the Jessie Vargas just recently and he\u2019s a young hungry fighter. I do think he\u2019s going down a little bit and I could take advantage of that,\u201d said Horn.,Horn\u2019s trainer/manager Glenn Rushton feels the fight would be a success due to the number of Filipinos currently residing in Australia (171,233 according to the 2011 Census) and the media interest so far in the fight.,\u201cI think it\u2019ll just go gangbusters here. The media are already fully invested, they\u2019re absolutely all over it. The back page of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Courier Mail, Channel 9 has been running stories on us and will run a big documentary. The media are pushing the state and local governments to try and secure the rights,\u201d said Rushton.,All Horn and his team can do for now is wait for the news.,\u201cI look at all the world champions at the moment in the welterweight division and I see myself beating all of them at the moment. If I didn\u2019t see that I would never get past the step that I\u2019m at and I\u2019d never get a world title. The first step in boxing is believing in yourself and I believe that I can beat Manny Pacquiao or any of the other world champions that are out there right now,\u201d says Horn. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/157821-jeff-horn-i-can-beat-manny", "title": "Jeff Horn: I can beat Manny Pacquiao", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/business/personal-finance/41796-10-money-savvy-tips-for-working-moms,http://www.rappler.com/nation/93602-kentex-welding-valenzuela-fire-investigation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/16725-magnitude-5-2-quake-hits-sultan-kudarat,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/balikbayan/156269-trump-filam-racism"},

Here are the main arguments and counter-arguments.    , ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Supreme Court (SC) will begin on Tuesday, June 13, its 3-day oral arguments on 3 consolidated petitions, which seek to nullify President Rodrigo Duterte's Proclamation Number 216 or martial law in Mindanao. (READ: ,Questions you need to ask about martial law in Mindanao,),Defending Duterte will be Solicitor General Jose Calida, who will go up against 3 groups of petitioners: minority lawmakers led by Albay 1st District Representative Edcel Lagman, activist groups led by Lumad leader Eufemia Cullamat, and Marawi City residents led by Mindanao State University (MSU) professor Norkaya Mohamad.,Based on their petitions and Calida's consolidated comments, Rappler compiles the main arguments and counter-arguments for your guide during the debates that will last until Thursday, June 15.,1. Marawi siege: Rebellion or not? ,Section 18, Article VII, of the Constitution says: \"In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, [the President] may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.\",Rebellion, meanwhile, is defined under the Revised Penal Code as \",a, crime committed by rising publicly and taking arms against the Government for the purpose of removing from the allegiance to said Government or its laws, the territory of the Philippine Islands or any part thereof.\",PETITIONERS: ,The crisis in Marawi is just a \"pretended existence of rebellion and/or invasion.\" They say that what happened in the city is not an attempt to \"remove from the allegiance\" to the Republic but just an armed resistance to protect leader Isnilon Hapilon from death or capture.,CALIDA: ,The circumstances of the Marawi crisis reject the assertion that the siege was just meant to protect Hapilon. The siege was \"intended to be the climax of a clear and actual takeover of Philippine territory by means of a violent uprising against the government.\",According to military information, the Maute Group had planned to raze Marawi City during Ramadan and it was to be a precursor to establishing an Islamic State (ISIS) province in Mindanao. \"It is a strategic and well-coordinated attack to overthrow the present government and establish a ,wilayah, in Mindanao.\",2. Is martial law necessary?,Rebellion's definition under the law includes the qualification that the uprising to \"remove from the allegiance to the Philippine government\" also ,\"deprives the Chief Executive or the Legislature, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives.\",PETITIONERS: ,The crisis has not reached an extent that public safety has already required the declaration of martial law. It is precisely why the words \"imminent danger\" were deleted from the provision in the Constitution to make sure that martial law is declared only in the event of an actual rebellion, not just the danger of it. It was a constitutional safeguard to prevent presidents from abusing their martial law powers.,CALIDA: ,Under the Constitution, rebellion is already existing when the armed uprising \"deprives the Chief Executive or the Legislature, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives.\" ,That is the case, for example, with the release of over 100 inmates from the Marawi City jail in the first few days of the clashes.  ,The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology exercises supervision or control over jails, the BJMP is under the Department of the Interior and Local Government, and the DILG is under Duterte. Because the 107 inmates are free, the BJMP no longer has custody of these inmates, which ultimately means the incident \"resulted in a deprivation of President Duterte's power to keep these prisoners in custody.\",\"Aside from the effects of the attacks on the civilian population, the strong combat capability, and seemingly limitless firepower and other resources that ISIS-inspired rebels have displayed in their attacks show that the interest of public safety required the issuance of Proclamation Number 216.\" ,3.  Martial law should be last resort.,PETITIONERS: ,Martial law \"is an instrument of last resort.\" If a less severe remedy exists, the government must do that first. \"Only when there is a showing that the situation cannot be contained unless martial law is declared, can the use of such extraordinary power of the President be justifiable,\" the Mohamad petition says. One of the counsels in the Mohamad petition is constitutionalist Christian Monsod.,CALIDA: ,Yes, that it is the last resort, according to ,Proclamation 55,, which Duterte issued September 2016 when Davao City was rocked by bombing. It was a call to the military to prevent or suppress lawless violence in Mindanao.,But this \"proved ineffective\" because the \"ISIS-inspired terror groups continued to wreak havoc in Mindanao \u2013 kidnapping and bombing incidents, murder, and attacks against government operatives happened in Basilan, Maguindanao, Tawi-Tawi and Sulu, among others, in the period between November 2016 and April 2017.\",Martial law, therefore, was necessary by that time. ,4. Did Duterte act on his own?,PETITIONERS: ,The declaration was flawed because ,it did not come from the recommendation of Duterte's security officials,, such as Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, now designated martial law administrator.,CALIDA: ,Duterte does not need any recommendation to make his declaration valid. \"The Constitution bestows the full authority to proclaim martial law upon the President and no one else, and without need for the prior approval of any other public official, much less his alter ego.\",\"Any recommendation given by officers of the military, at most, would merely be advisory and can be disregarded by the President, their Commander-in-Chief. After all, civilian authority, embodied through the President's position as Commander-in-Chief, is at all times supreme over the military.\" ,5. Was martial law based on fake news?,Inconsistencies have been found in the incidents cited by Duterte in the martial law report he submitted to Congress on May 25, or within 48 hours of his declaration.  ,PETITIONERS: ,According to several news reports, hospital officials denied that the Amai Pakpak Medical Center was taken over by terrorists, its employees held hostage. The ,Philippine Star, did a fact-check, which points out that while Duterte said in his report that the Senator Ninoy Aquino Foundation College was burned by terrorists night of May 23, witnesses on the ground saw the school intact as of May 24. The same report also said that while Duterte said the Land Bank branch in Marawi was ransacked, the bank management clarified that only their vehicle \u2013 which was empty \u2013 was stolen by terrorists.,CALIDA: ,(Calida did not provide clarifications for the claims in the martial law report and, in fact, repeated them in the comment he submitted to the SC. His contention, however, is that ,the petitioners' arguments are invalid, because they only used news reports to back up their claims.),\"News articles amount to 'hearsay evidence, twice removed,' and are therefore not only inadmissible, but are without any probative value at all whether objected to or not.\",6. Should Congress have convened?,Section 18, Article VII, of the Constitution: \"The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President.\",PETITIONERS: ,\"There is even greater necessity for the Court to rule upon the sufficiency of the factual basis for the proclamation where there has been no congressional action,\" says the Mohamad petition.,CALIDA: ,The separate resolutions of the lower and upper chambers are enough, and are considered the representation of the will of the people.,\"In the case of President Duterte's Proclamation Number 216, the two houses of Congress expressed their support for the necessity of the issuance. The declaration of martial law, therefore, carries with it the imprimatur of the Filipino people.\",The SC's oral arguments will run Tuesday (June 13), Wednesday (June 14), up to Thursday (June 15), beginning at 10 am on all days. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/172734-guide-sc-oral-arguments-nullify-martial-law", "title": "Nullify martial law?

File photo of former Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan Sr (center). File photo by Noel Celis/EPA/Pool ,MANILA, Philipppines (UPDATED) \u2013 Ampatuan family patriarch Andal Ampatuan Sr, on trial for masterminding the 2009 Maguindanao massacre that killed 58, passed away at 10:30 in the evening of Friday, July 17.,Ampatuan Sr, diagnosed with liver cancer, was confined at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute in Quezon City. His lawyer Salvador Panelo told Agence France-Presse that the former Maguindanao governor was informed by doctors he had 3 to 6 months to live. ,Bai Mayan Sinsuat, who spoke to her son-in-law and former vice governor Sajid Islam Ampatuan, one of Ampatuan Sr's sons, confirmed the death with Rappler. ,He had been in hospital for almost two months since complaining of abdominal pains while held in his maximum security jail.,Ampatuan Sr, along with his son, Andal \"Unsay\" Ampatuan Jr, is the principal accused in the massacre of 58 individuals in Sityo Masalay, Ampatuan, Maguindanao in November 2009. There are 100 co-accused. ,The Ampatuan clan was believed to have plotted the massacre to thwart the gubernatorial candidacy of rival Esmael \"Toto\" Mangudadatu for the 2010 May elections. Mangudadatu sent a convoy of vehicles that included his wife, lawyers and other female relatives to file his certificate of candidacy in Sultan Kudarat. Thirty-two journalists were present to cover Mangudadatu's candidacy. The convoy, among them two civilian vehicles, was stopped at a hillside by waiting gunmen.,Some of the bullet-riddled bodies were strewn on the open field when police arrived. More had been buried on the same day, along with several of the vehicles. ,Mangudadatu, who won and is still the governor of Maguindanao told Rappler earlier that \"Allah will be responsible for him and for those he has killed.\" He added that Ampatuan Sr \"will definitely be answerable to his sins before God.\",Slow trial,\"Now that he's dead, I don't know how to feel,\" said Reynafe Momay in Filipino. Reynafe, a registered nurse now working in the United States, is the daughter of photojournalist Reynaldo \"Bebot\" Momay. Momay's body, the 58th, has never been recovered. ,The murder trial of the elder Ampatuan and 7 other clan members has moved slowly over the past 5 years. Reynafe has called the process frustrating, with updates few and far between. ,The brazenness and brutality of the massacre made international headlines, prompting President Benigno Aquino III, who took office in 2010, to work for a resolution of the court proceedings before he steps down from office in 2016.,But given the notoriously slow Philippine justice system, there are fears the trial will still not be completed before Aquino's term ends.,The Ampatuan patriarch ruled Maguindanao as governor for a decade with a private army tolerated by then president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo who used his forces as a buffer against Muslim insurgents.,One of his sons and co-accused, Sajid Ampatuan, was released on bail in May.,A month earlier, in April, a local court ,denied Ampatuan Senior's plea for bail,, saying that evidence against him is strong.,Many other suspects, including Ampatuan clan members, remain at large while human rights groups and victims' relatives say witnesses are being killed or intimidated to try to sabotage the case.,The Philippines has long been blighted by a \"culture of impunity\" in which the powerful believe they can commit crimes like murder and escape unpunished.,\"When I say it's mixed emotions,\" said Reynafe, \"I can't help but remember how it feels to lose a parent. I know even if (Ampatuan) was that way he still has family who love him and mourn him. But I am still human. At the back of my mind, I hoped he would live longer, just so he would have time to repent from his sins,\" she said in Filipino.,\"Sana habang nasa death bed siya, nakahingi siya ng tawad. Dapat nag-sorry siya sa mga victims. Naaawa ako sa family niya na nawalan. Hindi ako masaya na namatay siya,\", she told Rappler. (I wish that he was able to seek forgiveness in his death bed. he should have apologized to his victims. I pity his family who lost him.

Photo courtesy of the Supreme Court Public Information Office   ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said on Friday, May 26, that the fate of the country after the ,declaration of martial law, in Mindanao will depend on the people's own actions, making sure the horrors of the past will not be repeated.,Sereno said this in a speech during commencement exercises of Ateneo de Manila University in Quezon City on Friday. Sereno, who obtained her undergraduate degree in Economics from Ateneo, said she \"discarded her prepared speech\" to talk about martial law before new graduates.,\",Suffice it to say that the martial law power is an immense power that can be used for good, to solve defined emergencies; but all earthly powers when abused can result in oppression,,\" Sereno said.,According to the Chief Justice, if President Rodrigo Duterte \"avoids the gross historical sins\" of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, his martial law in Mindanao \"can reap the benefits of the legitimate use of the provisions of martial law.\",Duterte, before flying home from Russia on Wednesday, ,said,: ,\"Martial law is martial law ,ha,. It will not be any different from what the president, Marcos did. I'd ,be harsh.\" ,\",As we face the days following President Duterte's declaration of martial law in Mindanao, it behooves us to ask what we can do in the present, with the time that is given to us, to ensure that the horrors of martial law that followed the 1972 declaration do not happen again,\" Sereno said. ,(READ: ,Questions you need to ask about martial law in Mindanao,),1987 Constitution,Sereno highlighted the provisions in the 1987 Constitution that limit Duterte's powers during martial law.,\"Th,e 1987 Constitution clearly says a state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus,\" Sereno said.,While it did not come automatically, Duterte has nevertheless, suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao, which gives the military the power to arrest without warrant individuals suspected to have a direct connection to the rebellion.,After the declaration of martial law in Mindanao on Tuesday, May 23, Sereno immediately issued an advisory to courts in Mindanao to \"remain open as far as their local circumstances may allow.\",Although warrantless arrests are authorized during martial law under specific guidelines, the law states that any person arrested should be judicially charged within 3 days. Otherwise, he or she should be released.,On Thursday, May 26, Davao City cops rounded up a couple of hundred individuals and considered them \"persons of interest\" until they were able to provide identification.,Solicitor General Jose Calida, who is in Davao City where Duterte held a Cabinet meeting late Thursday night to discuss martial law, said in a press conference on Friday that the individuals were just invited for questioning, and consequently released.,\",Will this martial law declaration bring back the human rights violations and the depredations that characterized the Martial Law regime of 1972?....Will our voices still be heard? The answer, my dear graduates, is 'It depends,'\" Sereno said.,The safeguarding of the rights of the people during today's martial law depends, she said, on Duterte and his government agents' willingness \"to take sufficient care to abide by the Constitution and the laws.\",Sereno added, in a call to all Filipinos: \"Do your part to ensure that this declaration of Martial Law does not imperil your future.\" (READ: ,DND to AFP: Uphold rule of law, human rights in Mindanao,),Under the 1987 Constitution, the declaration of martial law can be ,challenged, before the Supreme Court (SC).

Those of us who were alive at the time bore witness to the human rights atrocities and the corruption caused by such absolute power,\" Sereno said.,The Chief Justice added: \"The Martial Law period of 1972 put the Philippines in an economic tailspin that saw us go from the second most vibrant economy in Asia to its sick man...the excessive foreign borrowing during the Marcos regime stagnated development and became one of the root causes of widespread poverty, leaving the economy in a precarious state.\",It was the SC who ,approved, the hero's burial for the late Marcos in a split decision in November 2016, a decision from which Sereno dissented, along with ,Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, and Associate Justices Marvic Leonen, Francis Jardeleza, and Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa. ,(READ: ,Marcos burial: What did the dissenting SC justices say?,),Sereno praised the Ateneans' participation in the pockets of protest across Metro Manila which came after the SC decision, and renewed calls for the accountability of the Marcoses for the human rights abuses which occurred during his 9-year martial rule.,\",Last year, when the history of our nation was subjected to attempts at revision, you were among the first to speak up...As a fellow Atenean, I understood that this passionate outpouring of righteous anger sprang from a deep understanding of what it means to be a person for others,\" Sereno said.,In past speeches, Sereno had slammed what she referred to as a rising culture of impunity and a gross disregard for due process. On Friday before young Ateneans, Sereno repeated her call.,\"W,e are not fighting a person or an establishment but a culture, a pattern that pervades our society today. It is a pattern of apathy, rage, and despair: one that began when people learned to tolerate wrong, stopped hoping, and ceased caring,\" Sereno said.,The Chief Justice added: \"I urge you to speak out with truth even against the overwhelming tide of popular opinion and reach out to the oppressed and disenfranchised.

Screengrab from Nokia  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Before Android and iPhones took over the world, it was Nokia that dominated the mobile phone business. Its eventual decline, the last chapter of which was helmed by tech giant Microsoft, was a sad sight for consumers who grew up with Nokia phones. ,Like the phones themselves, however, the brand has shown great resilience. The brand lives on, with Microsoft having sold the Nokia phone business to two companies: FIH and the ,young Finnish company HMD Global, back in May. The former will be manufacturing the devices while the latter will be selling and marketing the devices.  ,In a ,post, on the HMD website dated December 13, the resurrection appears to be nearing completion. The company has revealed its first Nokia phones since securing rights to the brand: the Nokia 150 and the Nokia 150 Dual Sim. These two phones will be the first new Nokia devices to release since Microsoft's final offering, the 216, arrived in October.,But don't get excited just yet. The 150 and 150 Dual Sim are not the Android devices that HMD previously announced they would make \u2013 although those are still most likely arriving.,Instead, we're getting a feature phone running on Nokia's Series 30+ operating system that boasts 22 hours of talk time and a VGA camera with LED flash. It has a 2.4-inch screen and has a suggested retail price of US $26. It's set to come out in the first quarter of 2017 in the Asia-Pacific (APAC), India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA) and Europe. ,Here are the full specs: ,Operating system: Nokia Series 30+,Display: 2,4\u201d QVGA (240*320),Battery: BL-5C ,1020 mAh4,Talk time: up to 22 hours,Standby time: up to 31 days for Single SIM, and up to 25 days for Dual SIM ,Camera: VGA with LED flash,Connectivity: 900/1800 MHz, micro USB, 3.5mm AV connector, Bluetooth 3.0 with SLAM,Memory: MicroSD card support up to 32GB5,Dimensions: 118.0x50.2x13.5mm,81.0g (including battery) ,Visit the product page ,here,. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/155512-new-nokia-feature-phones-unveiled", "title": "New Nokia feature phones unveiled", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/153643-top-phones-2016-by-budget,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/154250-nokia-brand-smartphone-comeback"},

If so, it would be the first recognized satellite extension of the caliphate in Southeast Asia.,A new video from Mindanao which began circulating on the dark web jihadi forum Shumukh al-Islam on January 4, 2016 shows Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon marching with other extremist leaders from Sulu and Basilan, including Abu Sharifa, the leader of Ansar al-Khilafa, among the most aggressive and targeted Filipino groups linked to ISIS. The groups pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.,\u201cThe ISIS-initiated merger of the fighting formations and unifications of the leaders will present an unprecedented challenge to the Manila government,\u201d terror expert Rohan Gunaratna told Rappler. Gunaratna is the author of ,Inside al-Qaeda, and the head of the International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore. ,\"In the Philippines, the next step ISIS is likely to take is the proclamation of ,wilayat, Mindanao,\" said Gunaratna., ,\u201cWith the proclamation of an ISIS branch in the southern Philippines, the ISIS influence and ideology is likely to grow, affecting both the southern Philippines and eastern Malaysia. ISIS is likely to create a safe haven in Basilan and mount operations from the Sulu archipelago into both the Philippines and Malaysia,\u201d Gunaratna added.,Who are they?,The most prominent figure in the video is ideological leader Isnilon Hapilon, but this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s declared support for ISIS. ,On July 23, 2014, a video of senior Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon along with masked men was posted on YouTube, ,first reported by Rappler,. Hapilon carries a reward of up to $5 million from the ,US Rewards for Justice Program,. He was indicted in the District of Columbia for \u201cterrorist acts against United States nationals and other foreign nationals.\u201d The FBI says he was \u201cthe deputy or second in command for the foreign terrorist organization, the Abu Sayyaf.\u201d , ,What\u2019s new about this latest video is the consolidation of different groups saying they declare allegiance to ISIS. Post-produced to show photo insets of the different commanders, it shows Hapilon, aka Abdullah al-Filipini, the leader of the Basilan branch of the Abu Sayyaf. He\u2019s joined by Abu Anas al-Muhajir, leader of the Ansar al-Shariah Battalion, Abu Harith al Filipini, a representative of the Ma\u2019arakat al-Ansar Battalion in Sulu. Also in the group is Abu Sharifa, the leader of Ansar al-Khilafa, most recently the target of military operations last month. ,This follows a December video released by another ISIS account of Filipino jihadists allegedly training in the southern Philippines.,That same training camp was featured in the middle of another video released on social media in November threatening the APEC summit. (READ: ,ISIS\u2019 global ambitions and plans for Southeast Asia,),Government officials and military officers from the Philippines largely dismissed the training video and claims of allegiance since 2014, saying they were more aspirational than real.,\u201cThey\u2019re not really ISIS,\u201d said Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesman Colonel Restituto Padilla told reporters in December. \u201cWe view them as mere criminal gangs.\u201d,\",Karamihan po diyan kasi ay nakatuon sa pagbibigay ng simpatiya at saka pangingikil o paghingi ng ransom 'yung kadalasan yung iba,,\" said Padilla. (Most of the videos are meant to offer sympathy to ISIS concerns and others are meant to extort ransom.),Other officials dismissed the claims as propaganda, some pointing to the APEC non-threat.,The Philippines\u2019 National Security Adviser Cesar Garcia said last year, \u201cISIS has no training camps in the Philippines.\u201d,Black flag,Rappler started reporting the black flag ,adopted by Filipino groups, as early 2011, when it largely symbolized al-Qaeda. Since then, like many extremist groups globally, the \u201cblack flag\u201d extremists shifted from inspiration by al-Qaeda to ISIS. First posted on Rappler, this is the first known photo of what was then a rag-tag group of extremists now known as Ansar al-Khilafa. ,BLACK FLAG. Filipinos carry the black flag in the southern Philippines. Sourced by Rappler,What seems clear is that the old networks powered by al-Qaeda\u2019s ideology have adapted, using the same links forged by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), once al-Qaeda\u2019s network in Southeast Asia. As JI was decimated, the networks transformed, showing evidence that ISIS has been grafted onto these deep roots. (WATCH: ,Q&A: ISIS in Southeast Asia,),The continued presence of foreigners in extremist networks show the evolution of the JI networks into ISIS.,In December, the Philippine military confirmed Malaysian Mohammed Najib Husen was among 26 Abu Sayyaf members killed in operations in Basilan. He was among 3 Malaysians who fled to the Philippines to train and recruit fighters for ISIS.,In late November, the military claimed it killed Indonesian Ibrahim Alih, also known as Abdul Fatah, linked to the JI suicide attack on the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in 2004. Although his body has yet to be found, he was allegedly among 8 killed in ,a battle with Ansar al-Khilafa.,Danger ahead,While the Philippine government and military remain steadfast in their statements that there are no operational links between ISIS and Filipino groups, a traditional \"order of battle\" analysis may be moot in today\u2019s threat landscape given ISIS\u2019 ability to spark ,homegrown attacks like in Paris,. (WATCH: ,Rappler Talk: ISIS in Southeast Asia,),Filipino officials have warned ,about ISIS recruitment, in Mindanao, but in 2015, more than 65 countries, led by the United States and its allies, pulled together to find an effective way of countering ,ISIS threat on social media,.  (READ: ,How to fight ISIS? Build communities,),Gunaratna  outlines a 5-step ,process ISIS follows, to expand beyond its core area in Iraq and Syria.,\"First, raising awareness of the Islamic Caliphate through propaganda,\" he said. \"Second, a series of groups pledging their allegiance to the 'Caliph.' Third, selection of groups to form a province. Fourth, the selection of a leader to lead the ISIS branch, and fifth, the ISIS proclamation of a designated area as a province of the caliphate.\" ,Gunaratna encourages the Philippines to take pro-active measures to deal with the threat sooner rather than later, especially with a potential roadblock in the peace process. ,\"As the 'soldiers of the caliphate' in the Phililppines, they will mount operations that will increasingly mirror ISIS core in Syria and Iraq,\" he said. \"There is no better time for the governent of the Philippines to act. If President Aquino procrastinates, ISIS ideology will spread, gravely damaging the commendable peace process. The four 'battalions' of ISIS will grow in strength, size and influence and present an enduring challenge to his successors.\",\u201cThe most enduring threat will be the creation of terrorist training camps that will use not only Southeast Asians but other nationalities,\u201d added Gunaratna, pointing to the JI training camps set up in the early 90\u2019s as precedence. \u201cIt is very likely that ISIS will dispatch its explosives experts, combat tacticians and other operatives. ISIS plans to declare a state in Mindanao presents a very real threat to the stability and security of Asia.\u201d - ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/118553-isis-declare-province-mindanao", "title": "ISIS to declare a province in Mindanao?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/68370-star-magic-ball-2014-best-dressed-gowns-red-carpet,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/nation/65199-abu-sayyaf-leader-oath-isis,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/38692-9-11-black-flag-movement"},

The study's findings, shared with the public recently, categorized children based on age, namely: 0 to 5 years old and 5 to 10 years old.,Results showed that 15.9% or two out of 10 children from 0 to 47 months old were born with low birth weight or were less than 5.5 lbs.,The results also showed that 20.2% of children in this category were underweight, while 33.6% were stunted or had lower heights for their age. 7.3% of the children suffered from acute malnutrition.,In the 5 to 10 years old category, results were much higher. 32% of children in this category were underweight while 33.6% had low heights for their age.

Kahit alam ng tao na nandaya sila, hindi sila nagpapaliwanag... basta nakuha nila 'yung kanilang resulta,\" ,the senator said.,(We're the laughingstock of the world because the cheating is so obvious. Even if the public knows they have cheated, they remain silent... They're satisfied because they got the outcome they wanted.),Marcos also said that even his non-supporters have been coming forward with supposed evidence.,\"Meron na kaming natatanggap na sulat na [ang sinasabi] ay, 'Hindi kita binoto, pero alam kong dinaya ka... ito ang ebidensiya,'\", he said. ,\"Hindi na ito tungkol sa akin. Ito ay tungkol sa milyung-milyong boto na nawala.\",(We've even received a letter saying, \"I did not vote for you, but I know you were cheated... here's the evidence.\" This is no longer about me. This is about the millions of votes that were lost.),\"Asahan ninyo na 'yung mga boto ninyong nawala, asahan ninyong 'di kami titigil hanggang mabilang,\" ,Marcos added.,(To my supporters, we will not stop until your votes have been properly counted.),Right after the May 9 elections, Marcos had ,insinuated fraud,.,During the 3-day canvassing of votes in Congress in May, the main issue raised by Marcos' camp were the supposed 3 million \"undervotes\" that, according to them, remained \"unaccounted for.\",Robredo's camp, however, said it is normal to have undervotes in any elections. A co-chair of the joint canvassing comittee, Senator Aquilino Pimentel III, also dismissed having undervotes as a ,\"non-issue\", during canvassing. (READ: ,Election data quash Marcos' cheating pattern claim,),In deciding to file an election protest, Garcia previously said one of the factors considered by the Marcos camp ,was the cost,.,\",Medyo magastos 'yan,,\" he said. (That's expensive.),On May 27, Garcia said an election protest could cost at least P30 million to P50 million ($642,700 to $1.07 million) to examine votes in 12 to 15 provinces.,More to follow., ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

File photo ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Supreme Court (SC) set the dates for oral arguments on the ,petition against martial law, in Mindanao, which will be on June 13, 14, and 15.,SC spokesman Theodore Te said on Tuesday, June 6, that the High Court also ordered Solicitor General Jose Calida to file his comment on or before June 12. A preliminary conference for both parties is also scheduled on that day.,Calida will represent the respondents in this case \u2013 Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief General Eduardo A\u00f1o. Lorenzana and A\u00f1o are martial law administrator and implementor, respectively.,The SC will also suspend en banc and division-level sessions next week to hear the petition, a source said. The Constitution has a 30-day deadline for the SC to decide on the legality of a martial law declaration from the day a petition against it is filed.,This means that the SC will have to decide by July 5.,Opposition lawmakers, led by Albay 1st District Representative Edcel Lagman filed on Monday, June 5, a petition seeking to nullify President Rodrigo Duterte's May 23 declaration of ,martial law in Mindanao, because it is \"bereft of sufficient factual basis.\",The petitioners belonging to the 7-member House opposition bloc are the following:,Northern Samar 1st District Representative Raul Daza was unable to sign the petition as he was already in his district when the document was finished. Congress is currently on break.,One basis cited by the petitioners is that Duterte's Proclamation Number 216 erred when it said the Amai Pakpak Medical Center (APMC) was overrun by the Maute Group.,Lagman said this was already refuted by APMC medical director Amer Saber and other medical employees.,Lagman also cited other refuted claims such as the supposed ransacking of the branch of the Land Bank of the Philippines in Marawi City, and the supposed burning of the Senator Ninoy Aquino College Foundation by local terrorists.,The petition also cited the earlier claim that Senior Inspector Romeo Enriquez, Malabang police chief, was beheaded. It turned out Enriquez is alive.,Lagman also said that while Lorenzana had said that the Marawi City Hall was occupied, this was later denied by the military.  ,\"The petitioners also claimed that the imposition of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus is flawed because admittedly President Duterte acted alone, without any recommendation from or consultation with the ranking defense and military authorities, some of whom formed part of his official entourage in Russia,\" said Lagman.,\"The absence of recommendation and consultation was ,admitted and confirmed by Secretary Lorenzana, when he briefed members of the Senate and the House of Representatives,\" he added.,The 1987 Constitution allows the President to declare martial law for 60 days, but any extension requires the approval of Congress in a joint vote. The SC may also review a martial law declaration following an \"appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen.\", \u2013 with reports from Mara Cepeda / Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/172127-sc-oral-arguments-martial-law", "title": "SC sets 3-day oral arguments on martial law", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156674-duterte-christmas-eve-photos,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/fashion/133835-solenn-heussaff-wedding-dress,http://www.rappler.com/nation/171991-house-opposition-sc-petition-nullify-mindanao-martial-law,http://www.rappler.com/nation/171991-house-opposition-sc-petition-nullify-mindanao-martial-law"},

Here are our picks!    ,This has been quite a year for the smartphone. What once was a too-expensive piece of gadgetry has found a niche in the mid-range markets. We\u2019ve seen typical big releases from top brands like Samsung and Apple this year, but there are many other brands that jumped through hoops to deliver some of the most affordable and feature-packed devices out there.,We\u2019ve rounded up the best smartphones to consider for every budget, and there are ,a lot, to choose from. ,ZENFONE 3 MAX. Photo from Asus ,Budget: PHP 10,000 and below,Top Pick: 5.2-inch Asus Zenfone 3 Max (P8,995),This economical edition of the ,Zenfone series, has struck an impressive balance. The Zenfone 3 Max is loaded with a 4100mAh battery that holds enough power to last more than a day \u2013 not something seen with today\u2019s smartphones. With an HD display, fingerprint sensor, and consistently decent camera, it\u2019s hard to imagine that this device only costs P8,995. Sure, there are even cheaper smartphones, but the Zenfone 3 Max is the one with most value for money without crossing the P10,000 threshold.,Runners-up:,Cherry Mobile Flare X2:, The metal body and glass display don\u2019t make this budget-friendly phone look cheap. Armed with a 5.5\u201d vivid display, a generous 3000mAh battery, a 16MP camera, P7,999 is a bargain. ,Cloudfone Next:, At P9,999, it\u2019s just a smidge below the P10,000-mark. The Next is a capable phone that meets today\u2019s standard smartphone requirements, including fast charging for its 3000mAh battery. ,Starmobile Play Click:, For its dog cheap P1,288 price tag, the Starmobile Play Click provides a decent, bare-minimum, no frills smartphone that doesn\u2019t look like a total eyesore. ,Budget: 10,000 - P20,000,Top Pick: Vivo V3 Max (16,999),V3 MAX. Photo from Vivo ,Newcomer Vivo made a great impression with the V3 Max, a solid smartphone equipped with all the bells and whistles you\u2019d be looking for in a personal gadget, fingerprint scanner included. It comes with Android Lollipop and has a large enough display of 5.5\u201d, perfect for big hands.,It also comes with a quick-charge feature, promising 50% battery recharge at only 30 minutes, which is not something that similar mid-range phones tend to offer. Performance, battery, and camera quality are just some of the categories where it scores high, and for the P16,999 price point, this is a solid investment. ,Runners-up:,Asus Zenfone 3 Laser: ,The Zenfone line from Asus has been a hit this year. The camera\u2019s laser autofocus on this device should be enough of a selling point, but the aluminum encasing and protective glass display makes it pretty gorgeous for P12,999. From the same family is the P18,995 ,Asus Zenfone 3,. It sits at the higher end of this budget spectrum, but its well-rounded features can make you rethink buying flagships double the price. ,Oppo F1:, This iPhone look-alike is designed with young people in mind, sporting a 13MP rear camera and an 8MP front-facing camera for perfect selfies every time. At P11,990, it's hard to ignore. ,Motorola Moto G4 Plus:, Sleek design, good camera, and a rich display. The Moto G4 Plus throws in motions (twist to turn on camera, shake for flashlight) for ease-of-use, which is a good deal at 13,999. ,Budget: P20,000 - P30,000,Top Pick: Apple iPhone SE (P23,590),IPHONE SE. Photo from Apple ,As much as it looks like a bizarre rehash of the iPhone 5, the iPhone SE is actually a decent and affordable device. Apple made sure to reach out to the \u201cI prefer using only one hand on my phone\u201d market in a time of large and bold displays. Some people just want small phones. If you love the simplicity of iOS but wdon't want to shell out a car down payment for the Apple experience, then the iPhone SE is your total package ,Runners-up:,Moto Z Play,: The \u201clite\u201d edition of Motorola\u2019s sleek modular smartphones packs a more powerful battery than its higher-tiered siblings and a more palatable price: P22,999. ,Huawei Google Nexus 6P:, Google partnered with China-based Huawei this time to deliver this new iteration of its Nexus line of smartphones. Equipped with a Samsung AMOLED display, this is a unique-looking device. At P29,990, it's for those who want a Google phone but either can't wait for or afford the Google Pixel.,OnePlus 3:, For P20,990, the OnePlus 3 has garnered some wow\u2019s for its great balance of high-end look, 6GB RAM, fast charging with good battery life, and decent camera quality.,PHP 30,000 - PHP 40,000,Top Pick: LG V20 (P35,900),V20. Photo from LG ,At P35,990, this big phone is literally a handful and technically a phablet, but it sure does pack a lot of features. Loaded with Android Nougat and a Snapdragon 820 chipset, this device is one of the fastest in its range. It has a dual camera feature, something Apple made a big deal out of in its iPhone 7 Plus.,But this V10 successor is more than just a good phone for photography. t's even better for audiophiles as its hardware supports lossless media playback and can toggle between standard definition and hi-fi, making it a worthy and flexible entertainment device. It doesn\u2019t fall short on audio recording, either. ,Runners-up:,Sony Xperia XZ,:, If you're more into ,action photography, though, we recommend the 37,990-peso XZ, which is packed with technologies to capture action shots with great sharpness and accuracy. Overall, a refined flagship from Sony\u2019s Xperia series, retaining the line's signature water and dust resistant features and distinct \"It's a Sony\" feel. It's also great for PlayStation gamers with the PS4 remote play feature included. ,Galaxy S7 Edge:, Endemic to the Galaxy family is the beautiful Super AMOLED display, which explains the hefty P39,999 price tag. The Edge display is still pretty cool, and did we mention that this phone is water-resistant? It's still one of the most eye-catching phones out there. ,Motorola Moto Z,: Moto Z is upgradeable to Android Nougat, which is not something most Android phones are capable of.

Photo from Google ,The phone hasn\u2019t been released in the Philippine market yet, but it is highly anticipated by tech junkies and Google fans. Who better to make hardware for the Android OS than the makers of the OS themselves? Google\u2019s Pixel phones have generated much hype for this reason alone. The namesake is apt, given that the phone is the epitome of \u2018cute.\u2019,The camera is fast even in HDR mode (its default) and picture quality is said to top that of upper-tier players Apple and Samsung. But what\u2019s special about Pixel is the built-in Google Assistant feature. Android-powered phones often have custom OS that try to integrate anywhere from attractive features to little nice-to-haves, resulting in bloatware and ugly interfaces. You won't have to contend with these in Google's own phone. ,Runner-up:,Apple iPhone 7 Plus:, This headphone jack-less device may seem to be an unpopular choice for people averse to change, but there\u2019s a bevy of accessories to remedy that. The iPhone, despite its sky high price tags will always be a strong contender, thanks to the casual comfort offered by the iOS and the continuing strength of that Apple logo. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Anne was an IT professional for 7 years before wading into the unpredictable pool of freelance writing (and parenthood).

Senior Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon swears allegiance to ISIS,MANILA, Philippines - The Islamic State (IS), formerly known as ISIS or the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq or ISIS, is expanding its recruitment on social media in the Philippines.,On July 23, a video of senior Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon along with masked men was posted on YouTube. Hapilon carries a reward of up to $5 million from the ,US Rewards for Justice Program,. He was indicted in the District of Columbia for \u201cterrorist acts against United States nationals and other foreign nationals.\u201d The FBI says he was \u201cthe deputy or second in command for the foreign terrorist organization, the Abu Sayyaf.\u201d ,The propaganda video begins with still photos establishing the notoriety of Hapilon: his encircled photo on posters of most wanted terrorists from the United States, which include al-Qaeda\u2019s leaders. Al-Qaeda\u2019s symbolic black flag, which is being used by extremist groups in more than 20 countries around the world (including the foreign fighters of ISIS), peppers the opening montage. (Read: ,Al-Qaeda's black flag seized in ASG camp),In the video clip that lasts a little more than 6 minutes, Hapilon, wearing a black gown, links arms with men, most of whom hide their faces. Using a combination of his native dialect, Yakan, and Arabic, Hapilon and his men swear allegiance or \u201cbay\u2019ah,\u201d an oath, to IS and its head, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.,\u201cWe pledge bay\u2019ah to Caliph Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Ibrahim Awwad Al-Qurashi Al-Husseini for loyalty and obedience in adversity and comfort,\u201d says Hapilon, reading from a sheet of paper. The men, ostensibly members of the Abu Sayyaf, linking arms with him in the video recite the oath after him.,\u201cWe pledge to obey him on anything which our hearts desire or not and to value him more than anyone else,\u201d Hapilon leads the men. \u201cWe will not take any ,emir ,other than him unless we see in him any obvious act of disbelief that could be questioned by Allah in the hereafter.\u201d,Philippine officials as well as a former member of the Abu Sayyaf verify the identity of Hapilon.,This is not the first time Filipinos have said they joined and/or recruited for ISIS, although it's unclear exactly what that means.,The first known instance of Filipino support on social media for ISIS was posted on July 2.  It shows Filipinos in prison, many of whom are members or former members of the Abu Sayyaf, gathering around a black flag and swearing allegiance to ISIS. ,Three days later, a second video was posted on Facebook.  Claiming to be members of Abu Sayyaf, about a dozen masked men speaking in Arabic said: \"Our brothers in Faith, we are your brothers from Ummah Fi'e Sabilillah, the official media of al Harakatul al-Islamiyah [the official name of Abu Sayyaf].  We would like to inform everybody that we sincerely support our mujahideen brothers of ISIS.  We are willing to extend to them our right hand when their left hand is lost.\",To Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, they said, \"'You are to us a replacement of our mother and father.' Our aim is to join you to claim Iraq and As-Sham and to share the Caliphate by the will of Allah.\"  That ,video, was taken down before Filipino authorities could get a copy.,A ,third video, is being investigated by authorities in Southeast Asia.  In a mix of languages including Arabic, Bahasa Indonesia and Filipino, the masked men claim to be throwing Filipino support behind ISIS, but at least one investigator says the men could be Indonesians pretending to be Filipinos.  The video was uploaded from Indonesia.,Recruiting Indonesians,A day before the video of Isnilon Hapilon was posted, the Islamic State posted an 8-minute video targeting to recruit Indonesians. ,The ,video, declares the \u201cgood news\u201d that \u201cthe Islamic State implements the Sharia of Allah in the entire land\u201d and concludes with a call to pledge allegiance to ,Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, aka Caliph Ibrahim,.  (Read: ,Don't join ISIS, Indonesia's religious affairs minister tells Indonesians,),This is not the first call for recruits from Indonesia, which has the world\u2019s largest Muslim population and a once active terrorist network that carried out Southeast Asia\u2019s 9/11 and succeeding annual attacks until 2005. (READ: ,Indonesia\u2019s evolving terror networks,),In July, jailed Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir, the ,emir ,of Jemaah Islamiyah or JI, once al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia, called on his supporters to join ISIS.  ,JI's goal was to create an Islamic Caliphate through parts of Southeast Asia and Australia.  After authorities captured or killed most its top and middle rank leaders, Ba'asyir founded what one anti-terrorism official calls the \u201creincarnation\u201d of JI,  Jemaah Ansharut Tauhid or JAT.  (READ: ,Support ISIS, jailed Indonesian terror leader tells followers,) ,On June 9, the day ISIS began its march to capture Baghdad, a video of Indonesian men in Syria was posted on YouTube.  Speaking in Bahasa Indonesia with snippets of Arabic, they urged Indonesians to join ISIS: \u201cLet us fight in the path of Allah because it is our duty to do jihad in the path of Allah.\u201d (READ: ,Southeast Asian recruits join jihadist ISIS,),Officials in the region say at least ,60 Indonesians, 30 Malaysians,, 2 Singaporeans and 2 Filipinos have fought or are fighting with ISIS.  Analysts say more than 12,000 Muslim extremists travelled to fight in Syria and Iraq in 3 years, more than the 10,000 who fought in Afghanistan in the late 80's, the conflict that gave birth to al-Qaeda.,Authorities fear, like Afghanistan, fighters will bring the radical ideology and terror tactics home. It's certainly brought a global diaspora of extremists together.

(READ: ,Fault-finders, storm-chasers: Hazard mapping in the PH,),The MMEIRS study is prepared to have plans and strategies in place should a strong quake rock Metro Manila. It's time to review it.,In 2004, Phivolcs and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), together with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), conducted a study called the ,Metro Manila Earthquake Impact Reduction Study (MMEIRS),. It analyzed different earthquake scenarios in Metro Manila.,In 2010, further studies were conducted as scientific agencies, called the Collective Strengthening on Community Awareness on Natural Disasters (CSCAND), started the ,Greater Metro Manila Risk Assessment Project Risk Analysis Project (GMMA-RAP),. It allowed agencies to create maps that determine the depth of hazards present in an area, the extent and the frequency of hazards, and also the worst case scenario through modeling.,The 3-year project, funded by the AusAID through the UNDP, focuses on Metro Manila, but also includes portions of Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite, and Laguna.,Various information campaigns have been done to disseminate findings from these studies and educate people on how to prepare for this potentially devastating earthquake.  ,But are Filipinos really ready for it?,Here\u2019s what you need to know about the West Valley Fault earthquake scenarios and what you need to know to survive the \"Big One.\",The West Valley Fault has a 400-year cycle,The West Valley Fault, a 100-kilometer fault, is one of the segments of an active fault, the Valley Fault System.,The West Valley Fault transects portions of:,Phivolcs ,recently released, new, high resolution maps of this fault system that show details down to street level. You can check if your community is one of those near the fault line through the Atlas here: ,Download the West Valley Fault Atlas,The fault, which has moved 4 times in the last 1,400 years, moves roughly every 400 years, according to Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum.,The last major earthquake generated by this fault was in 1658, or 357 years ago. This means the metro is already due for the next big quake.,It is not the only fault line that could affect the metropolis. The last big earthquake that caused damage in Metro Manila was the one that destroyed the Ruby Tower in the 1960s. That earthquake was caused by a fault line in Casiguran, Aurora, north of Metro Manila.,(The 1990 Luzon Earthquake, which severely damaged the cities of Baguio, Cabanatuan, and Dagupan, was also felt in Metro Manila, but did not do damage to the Philippine capital.),In the studies conducted, however, what emerged as the worst case scenario is a magnitude 7.2 earthquake from the West Valley Fault on a weekday and at night.  Why night time? Partly because the studies found that the buildings most at risk of damage in the metropolis are residential buildings, according to Solidum.  (READ: ,INFOGRAPHIC: How powerful is a magnitude 7.2 earthquake,),Sign that the West Valley Fault moved,Given that it is not the only fault line that could affect Metro Manila, how do you know if it is the West Valley Fault that moved?,You will know by detecting the type of motion you feel when the earthquake strikes.,According to Solidum, those near the epicenter of a quake will first feel an up and down ground motion, followed by a horizontal ground motion.,UP AND DOWN. Those near the West Valley Fault will first feel an up and down motion, followed by a horizontal ground motion. Graphics by Ernest Fiestan/Rappler , ,Those farther from the epicenter will only feel a horizontal ground motion.,LEFT AND RIGHT. Those farther from the West Valley Fault will only feel a horizontal ground motion. Graphics by Ernest Fiestan ,If the West Valley Fault moves, the whole of Metro Manila will be affected in varying degrees. These areas may feel that up and down motion.,Those living in provinces near the metro \u2013 such as Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite, and Laguna \u2013 may also feel the up and down motion.,GROUNDSHAKING. A map showing the different intensities cities in Metro Manila will feel when a Magnitude 7.2 earthquake strikes. Photo from GMMA-Rap  ,The areas that will feel the strongest ground shaking (Intensity High 8 in the map), however, will not just be those near the fault itself, namely Marikina, Cainta, half of Taytay, Pateros, and Taguig.,The cities of Manila, Makati, Malabon, Pasay, and Caloocan, though relatively far from the actual fault line, will feel the same intensity levels as those near the fault line.,According to Solidum, this is because the foundation of those areas, especially Manila, are thick sediments that \u201camplify ground shaking.\u201d,The Manila Cathedral, located within the Intramuros area in the city of Manila, has been ,destroyed by earthquakes multiple times, because of this.,Effects of an earthquake on the West Valley Fault,Just like the Nepal earthquake, the effects of a magnitude 7.2 earthquake on a highly populated area like Metro Manila will include strong ground shaking, damaged infrastructure and utilities, and a potentially huge casualty count.,Damaged buildings, homes, other infrastructure,At the time the MMEIRs study was conducted, there were 1,325,896 residential buildings, 981 mid-rise buildings, 119 high-rise buildings, and 1,826 public-purpose buildings.  ,Public-purpose buildings at the time included hospitals (177), schools (1,412), fire stations (124), police stations (43), city and municipal halls (53).,Of these, the study projected, residential buildings would sustain bulk of the damage from the earthquake.  Details of damage projections below:,Residential buildings,  - 339, 800 (25.6%) partly damaged; 168,300 (12.7%) heavily damaged,Mid-rise buildings  (10-30 stories), -  27% partly damaged, 11% heavily damaged,High-rise buildings (30-60 stories), -  2% heavily damaged, 12% partly damaged,Public-purpose buildings, - 8-10% heavily damaged, 20-25% partly damaged,The quality of construction and the type of building materials used play a big role in a building\u2019s chances of surviving the earthquake, according to experts at Phivolcs.,Unfortunately, many houses and buildings do not follow standards. (READ:,12-point checklist for an earthquake-resistant house,),Simulations conducted as part of the GMMA-RAP study show potential damages per area given various scenarios. Potential damages from a magnitude 7.2 earthquake on the West Valley Fault are shown in the map below.,As a general rule, older, poorly designed buildings and those built of inferior materials are more vulnerable to collapse, according to Solidum.,Damaged power lines, fire breakouts,At the time the MMEIRs study was conducted, some 4,482 kilometers of electrical/power lines connected the different parts of the city to the main electrical power sources. The MMEIRs study says 30 kilometers of this massive transmission and distribution system could be damaged if a magnitude 7.2 earthquake strikes.,FIRE BREAKOUT. According to the MMEIRS, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake may cause fire breakouts in different parts of Metro Manila. Photo from Phivolcs ,Particularly vulnerable to fire are the urban poor areas where illegal and substandard electrical connections are common. ,Damaged electrical lines could trigger fire to break out in various parts of the city which could result in more casualties, according to the study.,It can be difficult for authorities to address these breakouts as public-purpose buildings, including fire stations, are among those expected to be damaged by the earthquake.,Mobility within the city will also be severely affected as some roads, bridges and flyovers are expected to sustain damages during the quake.,PIPELINE DAMAGE. These are the areas in Metro Manilla where water pipelines will be damaged when a Magnitude 7.2 earthquake strikes. Photo from Phivolcs   ,Water supply, communication lines,At the time of the MMEIRS study, the total length of water distribution pipes in Metro Manila was estimated at 4,615 kilometers. This system will be broken at 4,000 different points, according to the study.,Angat Dam, where 97% of Metro Manila gets its water supply, is also near the faultline and may also be affected by a strong ground shaking, resulting to a potential water leakage.,Like in Nepal, communication lines within the city will also be greatly affected.,Based on the MMEIRS, Metro Manila\u2019s communication backbone consists of over 9,445 kilometers of aerial cables and almost 4,000 kilometers of underground cables. In the earthquake\u2019s aftermath, 95 kilometers of this will be damaged making communication impossible.,Human impact,The impact of an earthquake emanating from a fault line that cuts across Metro Manila is definitely more devastating than that which happened in Nepal on April 25.,The Nepal quake, whose epicenter was located 80 kilometers away from the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, resulted in over 8,000 casualties. Compared to Manila, Kathmandu is less dense, with only roughly a million residents.,Metro Manila, during daytime, has a population of roughly ,14 million,, with a night time population of about ,11 million,.,The GMMA-RAP simulation map below shows potential casualties per square kilometer in case a 7.2 magnitude earthquake strikes at 7 pm, when most people are already at home. You can use the search bar to check potential casualties in your community or barangay.,Bulk of the casualties are expected to result from building collapse. The rest will be from fire and related hazards.,Based on the MMEIRS, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake from the West Valley Fault in this mega city will leave 33,500 people dead.,An additional 18,000 could perish as fire breaks out in various parts of the city mostly due to damaged electrical wirings. On top of these, some 113, 600 more will be injured.,Apart from expected casualties,  such an earthquake, according to the MMEIRS study, could leave 3.15 million people homeless.  ,As in Kathmandu, experts say hospitals may also be either incapacitated due to power and water supply failure as well as damages from the earthquake or overwhelmed by the number of patients pouring in.,What needs to be done,The new, more detailed maps should help people become more aware of the danger zones in their communities.,Rappler talks to Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum about what could happen if a 7.2-magnitude earthquake hits Metro Manila,More than knowing where the hazards are and the impact of a potential earthquake on their neighborhood, however, people need to know what can be done to reduce potential casualties and prepare for the \"Big One.\",Solidum stressed the importance of following the Building Code, making sure the code is updated and knowing what to do and where to go when an earthquake strikes.,\u201cShaking does not kill, collapsing buildings do,\u201d he said in an earlier interview with Rappler. (WATCH: ,#TalkThursday: Metro Manila earthquake scenarios,),Solidum also advises families to prepare by knowing the ,safest areas in their houses, and to conduct regular earthquake drills at home, in schools, and offices. \u2013, with Gwen de la Cruz, Gemma Bagayaua Mendoza, and Wayne Manuel/,Rappler.com,Learn more about how you, your family, and your community can do to prepare:,Earthquake tips: Before, during and after,A list of things to do to prepare when an earthquake strikes,12-point checklist for an earthquake-ready house,A checklist to identify if your house is earthquake-resistant,Preparing your family for an earthquake,A list of things your family can do to prepare for an earthquake,Project MOVE: Preparing for earthquakes,A 40-minute conversation with Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum and safety and disaster risk reduction advocate Martin Aguda on how the public should prepare for the \"Big One\",Metro Manila Earthquake Scenarios,Phivolcs director Renato Solidum talks about the different earthquake scenarios that can happen in Metro Manila,The Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) is a Project Agos partner.

We put it through its paces with a little bit of food photography.    ,A smartphone's camera can often be a huge deal-maker or breaker for consumers. It's a crucial talking point at keynotes, with top brands like ,Google,, Samsung and Apple ready to make their case. The young brand, Oppo, hangs its hat on designing selfie-friendly phones while the more established Sony and its ,Xperia XZ, makes the bold proposal that if you want sharp action shots, it's their flagship you'd want. ,Brands have their own takes on the debate about what makes a good smartphone camera. ,For Taiwanese brand Asus and their 5.5-inch ,Zenfone 3,, the proposition seems to be this: make sure there's something for everyone. The Zenfone 3 didn't scrimp on camera features. , , ,A common user probably wouldn't touch many of these options on a regular basis. If you've ever dabbled into photography though, you'll like the manual controls on offer. The Zenfone 3 and its 16-megapixel main shooter provides a well-meaning manual shooting experience.,First off, switching from auto to manual is intuitive enough that you won't have to refer to the user guide. On default, you're on auto mode. Pressing the \"M\" button on the side will enable manual mode, and from there you'll be able to adjust the ISO, shutter speed, exposure value (EV), the white balance, and the focus.,These 5 settings are lined up neatly on one side for easy operation with your thumb. If you've ever fiddled around with manual controls on a DSLR, you'd know the importance of being able to adjust the settings fast. On that end, the Zenfone 3's camera succeeds., ,At the bottom, a light meter can be seen, further simulating a dedicated camera. What we're seeing now is a growing movement to further empower the \"phone-ographer,\" and the Zenfone 3 \u2013 with its camera's user-friendly interface \u2013 moves that along. For relatively novel features to take off, there has to be an unending push from the manufacturer to constantly simplify the process for the user. You get the sense that Asus does that with their latest Zenfone. ,What one might like with the phone is its ability to get in close to the subject. Its minimum focusing distance was short enough to allow us to get the shots below. It also has a larger-than usual aperture (f/2.0) to let in more light and produce a somewhat more pronounced out-of-focus areas known as bokeh. For reference, a top-of-the-line phone such as the Samsung S7 has a wider aperture (f/1.7) but is almost double the price at launch. ,All the photos appearing here are taken straight-out-of-camera and have not been edited. These are JPEGS saved using Adobe Photoshop's \"Save For Web\" function: , , , , , , ,To achieve these, I manually pulled in the focus to the max, pushed the phone towards the food as though to kiss, and snapped away. The ability to take these close-up shots or macro shots adds to the variety of photos the phone can produce. It's great to be able to come in close and see the detail especially with a subject like food. ,I also replicated the close-up shots on auto mode, which produced reliably as well. The camera didn't seem to hunt for focus. Equipped with a combination of autofocus tech \u2013 laser autofocus, phase detection and continuous autofocus \u2013 it'd be disappointing if it did. ,One tip: be careful that you don't accidentally set the exposure value to the highest setting (+2), which might lead to overexposed, blown-out photos. ,Zooming out, here are the photos the phone was able to take: , , ,In the two photos above, you can see a pleasant out-of-focus effect in background, which helps you make your main subject pop out more. , , ,What's the takeaway? If you're a food blogger, the Zenfone 3 offers the versatility to help you cook up a batch of varied food photos. And while you're at it, why not make a GIF? ,via GIPHY,The cool GIF-making ability, a trick once found only in top tier models (\"Time Rewind,\" slow motion, time lapse), combined with the robust camera hardware gives one the impression that Asus seriously wants to carve out space in this competitive arena. With our test unit, the 5.5 -inch Zenfone 3, going for P18,995, it's fair to believe that the phone is pushing the more expensive premium brands to truly step up their camera game or risk losing customers to this value-packed unit. ,In fact, you can say that about the rest of the phone. It's wholly more affordable than the standard flagship but it tries to cram all these features that the techie will have fun discovering.,If there is one thing though that we'd like to advise the consumer \u2013 whether they are an enthusiastic food photographer or a general phone handler \u2013 it's this: grab the phone tightly. It is very, very slippery. Add that to the fact that it's a 5.5-incher, and you've got the recipe for a smartphone soup. Hold tight and don't put it on smooth, inclined surfaces.,For the full specs of the Zenfone 3, click ,here,. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,The food shown here is from 8 & Company in San Juan, Manila.", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/reviews/149772-asus-zenfone-3-camera-food-photography", "title": "The Asus Zenfone 3's camera aspires to be a do-it-all", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/138019-last-session-serge-osmena,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/148173-google-pixel-smartphones-vr-headset,http://www.rappler.com/technology/reviews/149773-sony-xperia-xz-camera-test"},

SCAPA recognizes the most outstanding smart city projects in Asia/Pacific excluding Japan (APeJ) in 14 functional eServices. This year, the winners in the various categories came from all over Asia Pacific excluding Japan, with Singapore and New Zealand each claiming three categories each.,\u201cThe Smart City momentum is growing extensively in the Asia Pacific (AP) region as many nations see it as an organic, bottom-up and middle-out innovation growth that will spearhead the next cycle of eGovernment evolutions. While at least 90% of all AP local governments or smart cities\u2019 growth leverage funds that are provided by central or federal functions, many of them are notably given the autonomy to create their own unique identity in city governance, strategic operations and provisioning of effective eServices,\u201d says ,Gerald Wang,, Head, Asia Pacific Government and Education.,\u201cAs such, there is notably a growing prevalence of citizen-directed initiatives and driving local industries, which ultimately contributes back to stimulating domestic social and economic sustainability. This year\u2019s submissions and winners highlight the impacts of climate change and slowing global trade. This led to the stronger push for environmental sustainability and operational efficiency so as to bring about better living standards and future continuity of the various AP cities,\u201d adds ,Sudev Bangah,, Country Manager for IDC Philippines and Indonesia.,IDC Government Insights, went through a rigorous six-phased benchmarking exercise to determine the Top Smart City projects for 2016. These included identifying and cataloging the key Smart City projects in Asia/Pacific by IDC Analysts across APeJ (25%), online voting to determine public opinion (50%), and the assessment of an International Advisory Council (25%).,\"Project NOAH as the government\u2019s flagship disaster management initiatives has empowered the Philippines with information such as; real-time weather data and high-resolution flood, landslide, and storm surge hazard maps through online platforms; mobile devices and social media.

The ,strongest earthquake to hit the Philippines \u2013 at 8.7-magnitude \u2013 happened in September 1897,. This occurred a day after another tremor of almost equal magnitude \u2013 8.6 on the Richter scale \u2013 hit the same spot in the Celebes Sea area between the islands of Sulu and Basilan.,One of the most recent devastating earthquakes in recent memory happened on July 16, 1990 when 2,412 people died after a 7.8-magnitude quake hit Luzon. Cities of Baguio, Cabanatuan and Dagupan were the most affected.,More recently in October 2013, ,another strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2, hit the country, ,destroying historical structures, in Central Visayas and leaving at least 222 dead. The ,last major earthquake to hit Metro Manila, caused the collapse of the Ruby Tower in 1968.,Experts say Metro Manila is due for a big one. ,A 2004 study conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ,Metro Manila Earthquake Impact Reduction Study (MMEIRS),, indicated that an earthquake hitting Metro Manila could destroy 40% of the buildings in the metropolies and kill about 34,000.,To prepare for such a situation, the city government of Manila organized an ,earthquake drill, on July 2.

To answer that, the High Court has to rule on 3 things:,Here is a rundown of the discussions of the SC Justices, the petitioners, and the government's lawyer, Solicitor General Jose Calida, during the oral arguments:,1. Was there rebellion in Marawi?,For ,Associate Justice Mariano del Castillo, the Maute group's act of raising the ISIS flag in Marawi is ,a clear indication of rebellion,. Albay First District Representative Edcel Lagman, a petitioner, contested this and said it was nothing but \"cheap propaganda\" from the local terrorists that claim links with ISIS.,\"They're precisely putting up their flag there to supplant the authority of the local government of their own. In effect, they're trying to remove the allegiance of Marawi City from the government,\" Del Castillo said.,Del Castillo's remark is favorable to the government. Calida even brought an ISIS flag to the Court to support the government's argument that the Maute group, an \"ISIS-inspired\" group, is trying to break away from the government and establish an autonomous province in the region.,Associate Justice Marvic Leonen wants everyone to be careful in giving prominence to the Maute group or to ISIS. For Leonen, imposing martial law might have just given terrorists the attention they want.,\",Just because we know that atrocities can be committed by barbaric individuals, it does not necessarily mean that we should impose the hardest, harshest solution possible....Because if we do that, we are playing in the hands of modern-day terrorists that use social media and want to elevate themselves to stature that the world can see through social media and the media,\u201d Leonen said.,2. ,Was there rebellion outside Marawi?,Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio gave a point-blank assessment: He sees no evidence of rebellion outside Marawi City. Carpio even told Calida that the government may be able to defend that there is rebellion in Marawi City, but not in other provinces in Mindanao.,Calida said rebellion is a conspiracy and other players might be outside Marawi, for example its financiers and coddlers. Carpio even helped Calida take his argument up a notch: What if the Maute group deployed its snipers to Manila to assassinate the country's top security officials, will that mean there's rebellion in the capital?,Calida insisted that the scenario would be a case of rebellion, but later  said, \"If it's just assassination, then it's not rebellion.\",\"Capability does not mean rebellion, you have the intent, you have the capability, that doesn't speak of rebellion,\" Carpio said. He added that even if Maute terrorists escape Marawi, they can be subjected to warrantless arrest in areas  not covered by martial law because rebellion is a continuing crime.,3. Does public safety require it?,Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said that there are two grounds for a valid martial law: factual basis and necessity. Calida tried to oppose this, citing a provision in Article VII, Section 18 of the Constitution which states that the Court \"may\" review the factual basis of martial law. He stressed that there was no mention of necessity there.,The Chief Justice, however, pointed out to Calida that Section 18 also states \"when the public safety requires it,\" meaning \"if it's necessary.\" She lectured Calida that \"we don't have to always repeat the same exact phrase in the following paragraph.\",So, did public safety require it?,Calida stressed it did and anyone who thinks otherwise is \"detached from reality\" and therefore \"showing symptoms\" of psychosis. ,Justice Del Castillo was leaning towards the government's stance when he asked Lagman: ,\u201cThe military casualty count as of last Sunday is already 58 soldiers, congressman. Dead soldiers of ours. And there are 25,000 evacuees now in Iligan C,ity. ,So for you the situation is still not that serious for martial law?\",For Lagman, the death toll and the evacuation all happened after martial law and therefore could not be used to justify the declaration because they are \"after the fact.\",\"They are the aftermath of an ill-conceived declaration, your honor. So this will not in any way validate the continuance of martial law. And we personally believe that the Armed Forces of the Philippines has the capability to suppress this terrorism in Marawi City without the President imposing martial law,\" Lagman said.,4. ,Is martial law different from calling out power?,The calling out power is a constitutional authority of President Rodrigo Duterte to call out both the military and the police to respond to security threats. This is something that he has already done through ,Proclamation 55,, declaring a state of state of national emergency on account of lawless violence following the bombing in Davao City in September 2016.,In his comment submitted to the SC, Calida claimed that the calling out power under Proclamation 55 has proven to he ineffective, prompting  Duterte to declare martial law.,During the oral arguments, justices asked Calida to differentiate the two.,Calida himself yielded there was no difference. \"Technically, there's not much difference,\" he said.,Carpio said \"it is hard to find a legal difference\" between the two. In pressing the government counsel to differentiate martial law and calling out power, Calida said martial law provides an exclamation point to the calling out power \u2013 to amplify the warning to terrorists \u2013 though Carpio said it appears terrorists still did not listen.,To further prove his point, Calida described martial law as \"calling out powers on steroids\" which eventually backfired.,Sereno told Calida that she was \"illuminated\" by Calida's description of martial law and cited the side effects of steroid use on human beings. She said steroids only make it appear that one is healed, but actually does not cure the illness. Sereno said authorities have to be careful as not to lead soldiers to believe that under martial law, they can perform their powers as if they are on steroids. Calida took back his statement and told the Chief Justice, \"Don't take that seriously.\",5. Is the operational guideline for martial law clear?,Leonen ,said it is not,. ,\"When I look at martial law, there seems to be no operational guideline except its limits,\" Leonen said.,Leonen also expressed his concerns about the authorization of warrantless arrests outside Mindanao. ,This issue is a little bit tricky. While the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is confined only to Mindanao, a person suspected or charged of rebellion can be arrested without a warrant anywhere, since rebellion is a continuing offense.  ,The question is: If rebels can be arrested without warrant anywhere, why is there fear that martial law would expand outside Mindanao?,For Leonen, all concerns would be addressed if only there was a clear operational guideline.  \"Martial law is not simply a declaration, martial law has certain real effects. And if there's no guideline and it's just a broad declaration, wouldn't you say that it may be difficult for us to assess the sufficiency of the facts in relation to what is needed by the President?\" Leonen said.,For Sereno, clear martial law guidelines ,would also protect the soldiers, who are on the front lines. The Chief Justice raised the possibility of the army finding its members in legal trouble should martial law be invalidated.,\"They are dying, their lives being given up, heroic acts being performed, and they do not know the legal conundrum they might face should this Court fail to sufficiently outline the legal framework for which martial law must be administered in this country,\" Sereno said.,6. Who has burden of proof?,For Calida, the petitioners carried this burden because they alleged that there was no factual basis for the declaration of martial law. Associate Justices Presbitero Velasco Jr and Lucas Bersamin grilled the petitioners on this issue.,\"You don't tell us the facts you want to be put [in Duterte's martial law report to Congress]. You know this is a passive institution, we cannot go out like the NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) or the police to gather the facts. We are not in that business,\" Bersamin told Ephraim Cortez, counsel for the militant group of petitioners.,\"You have only made a very bare assertion that there is no sufficient or actual basis, and this, to me, is not proof at all,\" Velasco added.,Lawyer Marlon Manuel of the Marawi group of petitioners told Rappler that the Constitution provides a check and balance mechanism that authorizes the SC to compel key government officials, in a procedure that the justices themselves would decide.,Though Calida said the burden of proof is not on the government, the SC still called to Court Lorenzana and ,A\u00f1o \u2013 martial law administrator and implementer, respectively \u2013 though they agreed to a private briefing of the top security officials.,7. Should we presume good faith on the part of government?,Bersamin ,believes we should,. Getting Cortez to agree that the SC should be trusted to make the call whether martial law was sufficient, Bersamin said, \",You leave that to the good judgment of the court, as you would leave the proclamation of martial law to the good judgment of the President.\",This issue came up numerous times during the oral arguments, and at one point, riled Sereno to draw comparisons between Duterte's martial law and that of the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos.,When Sereno was pressing the question, Calida said whether ,Duterte had sufficient basis to declare martial law was a, political question ,since the Chief Executive was given \"full discretion\" to impose it.,Sereno told Calida that invoking the political question doctrine in terms of the martial law declaration in Mindanao raised the specter of Marcos' martial law. She recalled that it was the \"principal mechanism by which the Supreme Court was blamed for having unduly validated Mr Marcos' martial law.\",To this, Calida assured the Chief Justice, \"One thing I can assure you Your Honor, President Duterte is not President Marcos.\" ,8. Was there intelligence failure?,\u201cIt\u2019s a total failure of intelligence....Why did it have to reach this point when practically the military was taken by surprise?\u201d Del Castillo asked Calida. Calida answered by saying that intelligence gathering is not perfect.,In his comment submitted to the SC, Calida revealed that ,the military knew as early as April, that the Maute group had deployed its members to carry out attacks in the region, particularly Marawi City. ,Major General Rolando Bautista, the ground commander who ordered the raid on May 23, ,told Rappler on May 25, they received the inteligence inforomation \"two to 3 weeks\" prior. Bautista explained that they were expecting to see the Maute brothers but were surprised when they saw Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, prompting the military pursuit.,Such security matters were perhaps tackled during the closed-door interpellation on the last day of the oral arguments, but Lagman refused to say whether there was something said in the meeting that raised questions about the declaration. Lagman was the only petitioner allowed to join the private briefing.,9. Should we fear martial law?,Del Castillo said no.,\"Martial law will only be with us for 60 days, assuming that he [Duterte] won\u2019t lift the proclamation earlier. With all the safeguards, I don\u2019t know why you are so worried,\" Del Castillo said.,For his part, Carpio said the people should know that martial law does not give the President any \"new powers.\" ,\"We, better educate our people that martial law really does not give the President any new powers that he does not already possess before martial law and that there's nothing to fear,\" Carpio said.,Though the Senior Associate Justice said this, he took issue with General Order No. 1. \"I saw in the general order that they are threatening media. I think that will not help,\" he said.,Carpio was referring to a provision in General Order No. 1 of the declaration: ,\"Media practitioners are requested to exercise prudence in the performance of their duties, so as not to compromise security and safety of the Armed Forces and law enforcement personnel, and enable them to effectively discharge their duties and functions under this order.\",Leonen also pointed out this issue, as he asked Lagman whether that provision can be gleaned as trying to control the media. Addressing this concern, Leonen repeated his stance that there's a need to clarify the guidelines.,The Supreme Court will issue its decision on or before July 5. \u2013 ,Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/173195-summary-sc-oral-arguments-martial-law", "title": "SUMMARY: SC oral arguments on martial law in Mindanao", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/145346-proclamation-state-national-emergency-lawless-violence-released"},

What happened today in Resorts World Manila...is very much unfortunate and will definitely impact our tourism industry Marlene Jante president of the Philippine Travel Agencies Association PTAA said in a statement on Friday June 2.Jante noted that Resorts World is xa0 a tourism destination here in Metro Manila and just across Ninoy Aquino International Airport NAIA Terminal III the primary gateway of foreign travelers to the Phiippines.Past midnight Friday June 2 xa0 a man fired xa0gunshots and set ablaze gaming tables at the casino floor of the Resorts World Manila in Pasay City.Authorities quickly donwplayed it as an isolated incident caused by a mentally disturbed person who had attempted to rob the casino and not a terror attack.The incident happened as government troops fought local terrorists in xa0 Marawi City in Lanao del Sur which prompted President Rodrigo Duterte to declare martial law in the island of Mindanao for 60 days.The PTAA members and airlines expect their sales to be affected by both xa0 incident. READ TIMELINE Resorts World Manila attack Stirring terrorism rumors The PTAA urged the public to stand behind the government as it addresses these situations referring to both the Resort World incident and the Marawi clashes.The contradictory accounts of what happened at Resorts World Manila caused panic among residents and tourists fearing that it was a terrorist attack. The NCRPO then clarified that it was not an act of terrorism.Resorts World Manila COO Stephen Reilly had denied false reports that there were two gunmen on the scene. What we urge however is for everyone to discern the facts from false news and report suspicious activities within their areas. xa0We do not want incidents like the one in Marawi City or what transpired in Resorts World this morning to disrupt our way of life. Filipinos should never live in fear at any given time Jante said. We also urge the government to keep our countrymen informed at all times.

Different types of lines indicate the location of active faults, fissures, and where faults coincide with fissures. Also indicated is the certainty of Phivolcs of the location of the fault and whether or not the fault is hidden by natural or man-made obstructions.,FOLLOWING THE LINES. The atlas shows a part of the West Valley Fault appearing to cross C.P.

The last major quake happened 357 years ago in 1658, meaning another one can happen as soon as 43 years from now.,\"Active faults do not follow averages. If it moves earlier, we need to prepare for possible movement within our lifetime,\" said Solidum. ,The map should enable national and local governments, homeowners, building owners, and disaster officials to prepare for this eventuality.,Phivolcs warned that buildings should not be built on top of active faults or within a 5-meter bufferzone on either side of the fault.,Buildings that violate this rule are likely not to survive the rupturing of the ground when the faults move.,Solidum, however, warned that even buildings and persons outside the buffer zone will still feel intense shaking during a big earthquake.,Thus, ensuring buildings are earthquake-resilient is the best preparation for an earthquake, he said.,Tool for disaster-readiness,Disaster and local government officials vowed to use the atlas to protect citizens. ,\"The Valley Fault System Atlas will play a critical role in our programs for preparedness,\" said National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) Executive Director Alexander Pama.,He gave assurances that the atlas will be used by the NDRRMC and its regional offices as a tool for minimizing risk and casualties during an earthquake.,The handbook will serve as a \"solid reference\" for the placement of evacuation centers, roads, and houses, he added. (READ: ,12-point checklist for an earthquake-ready house,),The Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), which heads the Metro Manila Disaster Risk Reduction Council, said the atlas will help in the formulation of plans. (WATCH: ,Rappler Talk: Helping Nepal,),Last year, the agency conducted an \"earthquake census\" in which they informed residents of certain villages that their homes are near active faults. The census, however, was hampered by a lack of manpower.,\"We fielded a team of engineers last year. Since we couldn't go through all the areas affected, what we did was to make a sampling and that is one barangay per city and this barangay should be able to echo to the other barangays what we have done,\" said MMDA's Emerson Carlos.,The atlas is also expected to help city planners draft more disaster-resilient land use plans. ,The Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) gave assurances that it would use the map as a reference when assessing land use plans of Greater Metro Manila cities and towns.,\"We are reviewing all the plans of most Metro Manila cities and last year, new guidelines were approved which mainstreams already disaster risk reduction measures. With the introduction of the VSF Atlas, we will definitely include this in our land use preparation,\" said HLURB Commissioner Antonio Bernardo.,Already, the HLURB requires developers to submit a certification from Phivolcs that proves their project site is far from any active fault, he added.,The stakes are high given the devastation a 7.2-magnitude earthquake is expected to cause.,In Metro Manila, the death toll could be around 33,500 with at least 100,000 injured, according to a ,study,.

We test it on two teppanyaki chefs performing culinary acrobatics.    ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 On Tuesday, October 19, Sony previewed their flagship phone, the Xperia XZ, a 5.2-incher with the top-flight specs expected in the segment and a P38,000 price tag. It's available now for pre-orders and will arrive in stores on November 18, 2016. ,The XZ arrives at a good time. The race for smartphone supremacy is fairly open this time of the year. The top brands are facing issues and some criticism. Google's Pixel phone is seeking to shake things up but a local release hasn't been announced. Younger brands are continuing to feed the market with budget-friendly offerings. Especially with Christmas around the corner, the good-looking XZ is in a position to steal some of the attention from consumers looking for a new top-tier handset. ,What might make you strongly consider the phone? Its proposal to be the best phone at capturing action shots. Nowadays, it's expected for premium phones to feature stunning resolutions and rich colors. The XZ, based on our short time with it so far, fairly has that down pat. The photos look good. But what's not always expected is this: the feature set to capture moving subjects. Typically, you'd want to bring out a proper DSLR if, say, you want to take photos of children, pets or sporting activities.,The XZ presents itself as a device that can be relied on for such instances. It's been given a slew of focusing and stabilization technologies and manual settings to accommodate action shots. ,FLAGSHIP CAM. The XZ's camera uses Sony's \"Exmor RS\" sensor which predicts the trajectory of objects in motion. In theory, this is said to produce shots without unintended blur. Photo by Gelo Gonzales/Rappler ,Stress test,To prove their point, Sony had media sit down in front of two teppanyaki chefs.,Have you ever been at a teppanyaki restaurant where a chef does culinary acrobatics in front of you? If you have, have you ever said to yourself, \"Man, I wish my phone could capture all that onion-chopping action\"? No? That's all right. We've never thought of it too. ,Sony did though. They had chosen the setting for two things: it was dark and the subjects were moving fast. It was an indoor setting with no strong light source apart from the occasional burst of flame from the skillet. In short: the worst place for most phone cameras \u2013 save for the best ones \u2013 to be in.  ,As the chefs started their routine, I spammed the shutter button on the touchscreen, hoping to approximate how the regular person excited by such a spectacle would use such a device. If I had more in-focus shots more than blurred ones, I would consider the experiment a success. I took about more than a hundred photos all in all, sometimes shifting rapidly from one angle to another to give the phone a little stress test.,Reviewing the photos, the majority were definitely usable. That's pretty good, given the challenging venue. See for yourself: , , , , , , ,Here, you'll see shots taken in succession to give you an idea of the phone's speed at processing images: , , , ,At one point, the chef performed tricks with an egg. Here's how the camera fared in that sequence, making use of multiple settings. On default auto settings, here's how it looked:, , , ,Hoping to freeze the action \u2013 specifically, to capture the egg in mid-flight \u2013 I tried out some of the camera's manual settings. The XZ allows you to set the focus and also the shutter speed manually from 1/4000 of a second to 1 second. I set the focus zone to where I believed the egg was going to be tossed around in, and then set the shutter speed to around 1/500 upwards. ,On a high shutter speed, there's less light coming into the sensor, explaining why the photos below are very dark compared to the photos above. But my focus here was to see if I could quickly adjust the settings to take a snap of the egg in mid-flight. Here are 2 shots: , , ,Dialing down the shutter speed, we get a brighter photo but also lose the ability to freeze the action, resulting in motion blur \u2013 an effect that has its aesthetic applications. , , ,In another sequence, the chef tossed around a cup of rice. I tried to look for the sweet spot where the action could be frozen while still leaving the other subjects such as the chef visible. , , , ,It's good to know that one has the option to turn up the shutter speed if the aim is to freeze the action. Tucked inside the menus, you can also hike up the ISO setting manually too to brighten things up at the expense of image grain. ,     ,The sum of its parts,On to the other features. How does the XZ secure focus in spite of the dim surroundings? Sony says this has something to do with the camera's laser-detect auto focus, which basically shoots a laser from the camera to the subject to measure the distance. The phone then uses that data to adjust the focus. Another phone that highlights its use of laser detection is Asus' Zenfone Laser series. ,Along with that, the XZ also uses phase-detect autofocus, a feature that ,Gizmodo, notes may have been ,first seen on the Samsung Galaxy S5, and then later with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It's a system that's generally faster than the more common contrast detection autofocus.,On the software end of things, the XZ is said to be equipped with predictive autofocus technology. The tech attempts to calculate the trajectory of a moving subject and adjusts the settings as needed to produce sharp photos.,While the Xperia XZ is not the first to employ laser autofocus and phase-detect, it's the first Sony phone to adopt 5-axis image stabilization. The technology is also found in Sony's semi-pro and pro cameras such as the A7 Mark II mirrorless series. Moving from Mark I to Mark II, 5-axis image stabilization was the big selling point because, in a nutshell, it kept things sharp even as you approach the slower shutter speeds. It's an especially important feature for video shooters as the tech smoothens what would've been shaky video. ,But before you start waving around the XZ like a madman, know that the tech has a limit: it can only compensate for camera shake to a certain extent. But yes, advanced image stabilization on a phone's camera is very much appreciated. ,On their own, these technologies have been seen before. But seemingly, it's Sony that has meaningfully packaged them for the phone-photographer who's into the active lifestyle \u2013 or who just wants to take photos of his or her rowdy golden retriever or playful kid. ,The XZ's rear camera has a resolution of 23 megapixels, and a front shooter with 13 megapixels. Sony says it goes from standby-to-capture in 0.6 seconds, and offers substantial storage (64GB). The model to be sold in the Philippines is dual-sim. Check the phone's ,full specs, on its official Sony page.,Those pre-ordering from October 21 to November 6 get a free USM-32SA3 32GB Sony USB To-Go worth P1,200, an Xperia smart case worth P1,790, and a 5,000 mAh Sony portable charger worth P1,390. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/reviews/149773-sony-xperia-xz-camera-test", "title": "The Sony Xperia XZ's big proposal: it takes the best action shots", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview"},

Black flags were raised by angry mobs in countries like Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen.,Al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni branch, AQAP (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), ,said the attack in Libya was to avenge the killing of its Number 2, Abu Yahya al-Libi,, and urged Muslims to kill US diplomats in Muslim countries.,Abu Sayyaf and the black flag,It was also in September last year that Philippine police discovered a black flag in the Abu Sayyaf camp of ,Khair Mundos, who carried a US$500,000 reward from the US Department of Justice,. Mundos managed to escape.,As early as 1988, al-Qaeda\u2019s financial network in the Philippines was established by Osama bin Laden\u2019s brother-in-law, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa. By then, Al-Qaeda leaders, including the architect of the 9/11 attacks, had trained members of the Abu Sayyaf.,Mundos escaped from a provincial prison in 2007 and headed the Abu Sayyaf group in Basilan. During the raid in 2012, intelligence sources told Rappler that ,inside the camp, they found the black flag, along with training manuals from Jemaah Islamiyah, once al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia.,It wasn\u2019t the first time the black flag surfaced in the Philippines, the symbol used by the group behind the latest spate of bombings in Mindanao. ,Following the black flag shows how the threat posed by al-Qaeda has evolved since 9/11.,BLACK FLAG. Filipinos carry the black flag in the southern Philippines. Sourced by Rappler,Symbol of unity ,The black flag taps into a secret motivation of al-Qaeda: a \u201cnarrative that convinces them that they\u2019re part of a divine plan,\u201d according to former ,Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Ali Soufan in his book, ,\"The Black Banners: The Inside Story of 9/11 and the War Against al-Qaeda.\",Al-Qaeda believes its black banners herald the apocalypse that will bring about the triumph of Islam.,It\u2019s based on what they believe is a hadith or a saying of the prophet Muhammad: \u201cIf you see the black banners coming from Khurusan, join that army, even if you have to crawl over ice; no power will be able to stop them, and they will finally reach Baitul Maqdis [Jerusalem], where they will erect their flags.\u201d Khurusan is a name for a historical region covering northeastern and eastern Iran and parts of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan.,This is where al-Qaeda believes the Islamic version of Armaggedon will emerge. Osama bin Laden\u2019s declaration of war against the United States ends with the dateline, Friday, Aug 23, 1996, in the Hindu Kush, Khurusan, Afghanistan.,Local sighting,The first time the black flag appeared in the Philippines was on Nov 6, 2011: a masked Filipino jihadist identified as ,Commander Abu Jihad Khalil al-Rahman al-Luzoni uploaded a video on YouTube, exhorting Muslims around the world to support the jihad in the Philippines. He gave his Arabic message in front of al-Qaeda\u2019s black flag.,Authorities have since identified him as Khalil Pareja, the leader of the Rajah Solaiman Movement or RSM, a group which worked with JI and the Abu Sayyaf on the Superferry bombing in 2004 and the Valentine\u2019s Day bombings in 2005. ,Using YouTube and Facebook, Pareja took the jihad online and began to work on Facebook with alleged members of al-Shabaab in Somalia and AQAP in Yemen. According to classified documents obtained by Rappler, soon after Pareja was arrested in early 2012, he told authorities he planned to join the jihad in Yemen, along with other Filipinos. His Facebook page used the black flag.,PAREJA. Screengrab from the first video of the black flag in the Philippines.,The black flag appeared again a few months later in August 2012, after authorities found the laptop of ,Malaysian Mohammed Noor Fikrie, identified by Philippine police as a member of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI),. Intelligence documents shown to Rappler state the laptop was recovered after a raid targeting the two most wanted Southeast Asian terrorists, JI leaders Marwan and Muawiyah \u2014 the targets of the first US smart bomb attack in the Philippines in early 2012. Both escaped and fled to central Mindanao.,Fikrie was killed by Philippine police, at the end of 2012 after he threatened to detonate a backpack bomb.  Marwan and Muawiyah remain at large. All 3 used the black flag and were in touch with their families through Facebook.,Now one of the men who trained with them in that central Mindanao camp, Ren-ren Dongon, is accused of masterminding ,the July 26 bombing in Cagayan de Oro City that killed 8 people and wounded at least 40 others,.,Khilafah Islamiyah not new,Much has been written about a supposedly new group, the Khilafah Islamiyah, which some members of the military and police say, is behind the recent bombings in the southern Philippines, including that on July 26.,A lot of conflicting details have been released:,A Rappler investigation involving intelligence and security officials from at least 4 different countries show how isolated facts have been woven together into a murky narrative and an erroneous conclusion.,\u201cKhilafah Islamiyah is a figment of the imagination,\u201d a senior Philippine intelligence official said. \u201cIt was a name given by an intelligence asset. It isn\u2019t what they call themselves.\u201d,When we put the facts verified by 4 different nations together, we get the picture of an evolving threat that is difficult for authorities to explain because they continue to look for top down command and control leadership \u2013 a mistake, because the ideology is moving through social networks and harnessing recruits for attacks bottom up.,This isn\u2019t a new group but the resurgence of the same ideology through the same social network.,Paradigm for analysis,Much like ,the US declared al-Qaeda dead,, and yet was ,forced to shut down its embassies and consulates around the world in August,, Philippine security and intelligence officials are struggling to define a paradigm for analysis of today\u2019s evolving threat. ,Around the world, 9/11 took most security and defense officials by surprise largely because they were still stuck in a Cold War paradigm, the US and the Philippines included.,9/11 triggered a fierce reaction from law enforcement agencies around the world. Al-Qaeda and its arm in Southeast Asia, Jemaah Islamiyah, were affected the same way: their centralized command structures collapsed and their operational capabilities were degraded.,Still, the old networks remained and continued to spread a vicious ideology, what I call the jihadi virus. My latest book, \",From bin Laden to Facebook,,\", ,mapped the spread of terrorism by tracing its spread through social networks \u2014 from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Southeast Asia \u2013 both in the physical and virtual worlds.,We\u2019ve lived through one cycle of evolution of al-Qaeda, and analyzing that gives us an idea of what is happening now.,TWIN TOWERS. A hijacked commercial plane crashes into the World Trade Center 11 September 2001 in New York. Seth Mcallister/AFP file photo,Coopting Filipino groups,In 1988, Osama bin Laden\u2019s brother-in-law, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, came to the Philippines and began to fund charities, non-governmental organizations and to build mosques. He also laid the foundations for a terrorist cell that galvanized against Pope John Paul II in 1995, among other plots. ,The cell included 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. He and his nephew, Ramzi Yousef (who was behind the 1993 World Trade Center attacks), trained members of the Abu Sayyaf in bomb-making and terrorist tactics.,The Arabs saw the Abu Sayyaf as puppets they could manipulate and grow, but it was with the MILF that they found sanctuary and created training camps in the southern Philippines. ,Then MILF chairman Hashim Salamat was steeped in the ideology of radical Islam. One of the founders of the Philippines' largest Muslim separatist group, the Moro National Liberation Front or MNLF, he splintered away because the MNLF was too secular. He led an MILF that wanted a state fully governed by the Koran and Islamic sharia law.,The ties to al-Qaeda and its associate groups around the world were formed in Afghanistan in 1980 when Salamat began sending Filipinos to train and fight against the Soviets. They were aligned in their goals (fight the government and the West) and forged a camaraderie that helped lead to Southeast Asia\u2019s 9/11 \u2013 the Bali bombings in 2002 and some of the region\u2019s worst terrorist attacks.,After the Bali bombing, key Indonesian and Malaysian terrorists fled to the southern Philippines and helped train and strengthen Filipino rebels, who used their new-found skills not just for terrorist attacks but also for criminal acts to raise money, extortion schemes, and political assassinations.,By 2005, the MILF had a new more moderate leader, Ebrahim Al-Haj Murad, who wanted peace in the truest sense of the word. According to the diary of the head of the Abu Sayyaf\u2019s propaganda arm, the MILF kicked out the leaders of JI, the Abu Sayyaf and the Rajah Solaiman Movement (a group of Christian converts to Islam who joined forces with the Abu Sayyaf) from their camps in 2005.,Cycles of regeneration,In the decade after 9/11, Al-Qaeda and JI weakened significantly. Each was affected the same way: its central leadership was decimated, and while it had the intent to mount attacks, it no longer had the same capability. Over the years, it evolved: much smaller attacks continued, carried out by less professional, more ad hoc, uncoordinated groups.,Al-Qaeda adapted and gave greater power to semi-independent affiliates like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP and to more loosely connected groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria.,Security forces in the West dismissed these groups as local, irrelevant to the global war against al-Qaeda, but they were wrong. They said since al-Qaeda no longer had command and control, it was dead. They failed to realize that at a certain point in time, attacking their own government was all these groups could do but as they gained strength, it was inevitable they would go back to their global jihad.,In Southeast Asia, JI's top and middle-rank leaders were either killed or captured. At one point, the small group in JI which was behind the terrorist attacks splintered away and changed its name to Jemaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT), but the ideology spread through the same social network, which has ,regenerated 3 times spreading Islamist terrorism through 3 generations,.,IN EGYPT.

AFP file photo,Dongons' ties to Abu Sayyaf,So where are we today in the Philippines? ,Military and police officials identified Reneer Lou \u201cRen-ren\u201d Dongon as the head of Khilafah Islamiyah, said to be behind Mindanao\u2019s latest bombings. Yet they failed to look at the family ties which show a different, clearer context.,His sister, Zainab, married the brother of the founder of the Abu Sayyaf and later led the group, Khadaffy Janjalani. Another sister, Amina, was married to Janjalani\u2019s second-in-command, Abu Solaiman. A 3,rd, sister, Nurain, married ,Ahmad Santos, the founder of the RSM (Rajah Solaiman Movement) and the leader of Abu Sayyaf\u2019s propaganda arm. Another brother, Jaffar, helped carry out the Valentine\u2019s day bus bombing on Feb 14, 2005, a joint Abu Sayyaf-RSM-JI operation.,Ren-ren Dongon was in the camp targeted by the 1st US-smart bomb attacks in the Philippines on Feb 2, 2012.  In August that year, authorities raided another camp and recovered Fikrie\u2019s computer (with the black flag). Ren-ren had just left the camp shortly before the attack.,There\u2019s a good reason why Ren-ren is always near ground zero of counter-terrorism operations: he worked very closely with the main target \u2013 JI leader Marwan, the alias of Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, a US-trained engineer who also headed the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM. He comes from a family of jihadists: one brother was arrested in Indonesia; another was arrested in the US. The US has a $5 million reward for Marwan\u2019s head.,It turns out that Marwan is now Ren-ren\u2019s brother-in-law, according to intelligence reports obtained by Rappler. ,12 years after 9/11, these are the ties that bind the same social network that has long been behind bombing attacks in the southern Philippines.,12 years after 9/11, a global social movement using the black flag is trying to lash back. It did so with limited success last year, ,enough to kill a US ambassador,. This year, a month before 9/11, ,the US closed 22 embassies and consulates and issued a global travel alert, because of al-Qaeda.  ,This threat is far from over. - ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/38692-9-11-black-flag-movement", "title": "9/11 and the black flag movement", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/nation/12217-youtube,-facebook-link-filipino-terrorists-to-al-qaeda-amp-global-jihad,http://www.rappler.com/nation/35029-cagayan-de-oro-blast-victims"},

Are we ready?    ,In 1754, Taal Volcano let forth its biggest eruption to date, an eruption lasting almost 7 months from May to December. ,In the ,first, of a two-part special, Rappler recalls the disaster through historical accounts and matches it with a present-day scientist's assessment. ,In this second part, Rappler explores the possibility of a 1754 eruption happening today., ,TALISAY, Philippines \u2013 Imagine a volcano in a state of eruption for almost 7 months. Imagine that volcano in the middle of a lake surrounded by populous towns. Imagine the eruption happening today.,The 1754 eruption of Taal Volcano, its biggest so far, was so devastating that it has become the government's worst-case scenario for the volcano.,The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) has created hazard maps based on the 1754 eruption, fearing it could happen again.,How likely is that?,\"The 1754 eruption, one of the worst case eruptions of Taal Volcano, can be repeated,\" said Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum Jr. ,But it will be difficult to say when.,\"See, there is only one 1754 event historically so we cannot say there is a pattern unlike Mount Pinatubo, it last erupted in 1991. Prior to the 1991 eruption, there were many large-scale events, enough data to say the cycle of explosive eruptions of a volcano. But in this case, there's only one 1754 scale,\" explained Solidum.,The dangers of such an eruption are unique because of Taal Volcano's extraordinary topography. ,UNIQUE FEATURES. Taal Volcano's low elevation, wide crater, and surrounding lake make its eruptions tricky to handle ,The main crater is very wide and quite low, unlike more typical volcanoes like Mount Mayon with a small crater on a high elevation. ,The Taal Volcano sits on an island surrounded by a lake. The lake is surrounded by the walls of a larger crater or caldera. ,The greatest hazards that may befall communities in the event of such an eruption are as follows, as explained by Solidum:,1. Base surge, - A cloud of hot gases, ashes, and rocks traveling horizontally at speeds of more than 80 kilometers per hour. It can cross Taal Lake's waters and reach towns in the mainland. It can bury, burn or blast away objects and persons. Its tendency to take up air can make it difficult for persons to breathe. ,2. Seiches or lake water oscillation, - Explosions and earthquakes accompanying the eruption can displace the lake waters causing them to flood towns on the mainland. Such a \"volcanic tsunami\" can go as high as 10 feet. ,3. Ashfall and volcanic rock fragments, - Eruption columns can send ash and volcanic rocks falling down communities on the island and mainland, crushing and burying objects or persons, or making it difficult to see and breathe.  ,4. Lava flow, - A flow of hot molten rocks can cover and burn areas on Volcano Island.,5. Earthquakes, - Strong earthquakes tend to occur during eruptions causing buildings and infrastructure to collapse and the ground to tear apart.,Tricky topography ,The topography of the Taal Lake area complicates the hazards, said Solidum.,For one thing, because of the steep slopes forming the wall of the larger caldera, fleeing residents would have to climb up before reaching the safer parts of the mainland. ,Ash could also collect on the slopes of the bowl, endangering people below. ,\"That ash can be remobilized during heavy rain. So the communities look at Taal Volcano but behind them, there can be a lahar event,\" warned Solidum.,A major eruption on Taal could wreak more damage for the simple fact that more people now live around the volcano, not to mention on it.,Today, around 6,000 people live on Volcano Island, thriving on fish farms and crop farming, and even making a living as tour guides for visits to the Taal Crater Lake.,The sites of the old, abandoned towns are once again populated. Surrounding towns are home to industrial parks, subdivisions, and commercial areas.,SURROUNDED. Human communities have resettled in the shores of Taal Lake. Photo from Drumlanrig from Wikimedia Commons ,Metro Manila, the country's seat of government, is only 60 kilometers from the volcano.,\"The airport, NAIA, can be affected by volcanic ash because you cannot fly airplanes during ash fall events. So it's not a very good scenario because the longer the eruption would last, the more problems we have in terms of our socio-economic functions being affected,\" said Solidum.,For this reason, Phivolcs has created and distributed numerous hazard maps based on the 1754 eruption. ,There is a base surge hazard map, ballistics projectile hazard map, and seiches hazard map.,BASE SURGE HAZARD. This hazard map by Phivolcs shows where base surge from a 1754-like eruption is likely to reach (orange) and the bufferzones that may experience ashfall (yellow). Image courtesy of Phivolcs ,The maps also anticipate eruptions from other craters of Taal Volcano. In total, it has 47 craters.,New technology also means government scientists can detect the likelihood of a 1754-like eruption even months in advance.,\"We probably won't be surprised because there are indicators before it will erupt,\" said Phivolcs Taal Science Research Specialist Paolo Reniva in Filipino.,For example, earthquakes will increase in frequency and strength. The lake's water temperature will rise and become acidic. There will be fissuring of the ground in some areas.,\"Our instruments will detect these and people will observe it,\" said Reniva.,Phivolcs currently uses an Alert Level system to denote increasing levels of unrest in a volcano before a violent eruption.,On alert for a decade,Taal Volcano is currently on Alert Level 1, as it has been for the past 10 years. This means there is some disturbance but eruption is not imminent.,\"We cannot lower the alert level to 0 because conditions are still above our monitored parameters. At Alert Level 0, there are almost no earthquakes,\" said Reniva in Filipino.,For the past decade, Phivolcs detects 5 to 10 volcanic earthquakes a day, on average. ,Volcanic earthquakes means rocks are breaking underneath the surface due to pressurization, he explained. The pressure may be from rising magma or from hydrothermal activity. (WATCH:, When mountaineers climb active volcanoes,),INTO THE CRATER. The Taal Crater Lake continues to bubble indicating the volcano is still active. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler ,To monitor the volcano, Reniva and his fellow volcanologists trek to the crater once a week to measure water temperature and other indicators and take visual observations. ,Measuring devices installed on different parts of the volcano measure water levels, acidity, concentration of gases, earthquakes, and inflation of the ground. The data is sent to Phivolcs at an almost real-time frequency.,Like other active volcanoes, Taal Volcano also has designated danger zones. In this case, the Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ) is the entire Volcano Island. Ideally, no one should be living on the island. (WATCH: ,Bulusan watch: managing the unpredictable,),It's been difficult to enforce this given Taal Volcano's recent calmness. The thousands of people who live on the island are in danger of being affected by a phreatic or steam-driven eruption \u2013 a type of eruption that can occur anytime and without warning.,Because of this, such communities will always be displaced when the Alert Level climbs to 3. This is when evacuation must be enforced by local government units, said Solidum.,The towns on the mainland will have more lead-time to prepare since they are separated from the main crater by the Taal Lake. Still, they are at risk of a submarine eruption.

It was the second of two bombs deployed in tandem. The first bomb hit the target \"squarely.\",\"We are trying to ascertain how it happened that the first hit the target, the second was far off. There must be some mistake there, either the men directing from the ground or the pilot,\" said Lorenzana., ,He said they had to use ordinary bombs because the military did not have enough precision-guided munitions at the time., ,\"We still have some precision-guided munitions. If they are released [they] will really hit the target indicated, but we did not have enough,\" he said.,But due to the tragedy, the new policy on the ground may be to use only precision-guided munitions from now on.,\"Probably, we have to limit air strikes to aircraft that can deliver accurately their ordnance,\" Lorenzana said.,Suspending air strikes would also be wiser given the additional ground troops deployed to Marawi City. But Lorenzana will leave the decision to ground commanders., ,\"There are more troops on the ground. Chances of hitting our troops is very big like what happened yesterday,\" he said., ,Focus on ground operations,Because of the isolation of Maute forces in specific strongholds in the city, air strikes may even become unnecessary, given the strategic value of using ground troops instead.,\"There's one strong pocket of resistance. If we can converge our troops there, the more we do not need air strikes, if we have more troops surrounding [Maute strongholds]. Maybe we need more armored vehicles,\" said Lorenzana, adding that 21 armored vehicles were recently brought to Marawi.,Despite the setback due to the killed soldiers and failed air strike, Lorenzana is not moving his deadline for security forces to end the siege on Friday, June 2.,\"The target is still there. Tomorrow afternoon (June 2), let's see, the situation is very fluid. But we're almost there, there are only a few pockets of resistance of the Maute,\" he said.,Around 50 to 100 Maute Group members are supposedly concentrated in a \"stronghold,\" out of the roughly 500 at the start of the siege.,This stronghold, located across a bridge from Marawi City Hall, is \"hard to crack,\" hence the deployment of more battalions to the area, said Lorenzana.,Some of the 500 Maute Group members were reported by civilians as leaving the city in \"small groups.\",The military has been receiving text messages from residents of nearby towns of the presence of Maute Group members who left the conflict zone. Operations against these persons will be pursued, said Lorenzana. ,About the ill-fated air strike and its impact on the morale of soldiers, Lorenzana said that while the incident is a tragedy, such accidents can happen \"in the fog of war.\",\"Of course it will be very sad, very painful for the soldiers, their companions. We just have to explain to them that accidents happen.

A 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit the northern part of Luzon, leaving 2,412 people dead and around US$369.6 million worth of damage to property.,The earthquake's epicenter (marked with a star icon on the map) was located near the towns of Rizal and Bongabon in Nueva Ecija. Most of the casualties and damage, however, was recorded in the cities of Baguio (Benguet), Cabanatuan (Nueva Ecija), and Dagupan (Pangasinan).,On October 15, 2013, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake rocked Central Visayas. The epicenter was located 2 kilometers southeast of Carmen, Bohol (09.80\u00b0N, 124.20\u00b0E).,The earthquake was felt throughout the Visayas and Mindanao regions, leaving at least 28 people dead and damaging buildings and historical sites across the region, particularly in Bohol and Cebu. Both provinces have now been placed under a state of calamity. ,(READ: Strong quake rocks Visayas; 28 dead),Prior to this the last strong earthquake to hit the area was a magnitude 6.5 earthquake off the coast of Bohol on February 8, 1990.,Strongest earthquakes,EARTHQUAKE-PRONE. Seismicity map from Phivolcs shows that Palawan has not been visited by destructive earthquakes. Photo from Phivolcs   ,Since the 1600s, there have been 106 earthquakes in the Philippines with a magnitude of more than 6.0. Of the many islands in the country, only Palawan island has not been visited by destructive earthquakes, according to a seismic map produced by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). ,The strongest recorded earthquakes that hit the Philippine Archipelago occurred on Sept 20 and 21, 1897, in the Celebes sea area, between the islands of Sulu and Basilan.,While no succeeding earthquakes so far matched the intensity of the July 1990 quake, it was not the strongest in Philippine history. In fact, the 7.8-magnitude record that year comes only as 7th among the strongest that have hit the country.,The Sept 20, 1897, earthquake registered a magnitude of 8.6 on the Richter scale, while the second quake, which occurred on the very same location the next day, registered a magnitude of 8.7.,Next in terms of magnitude were 3 earthquakes with a magnitude of 8.3 (Aklan in 1948; near Davao Oriental in 1924; Celebes Sea in 1918). There were 3 with a magnitude of 8.1 (west of Sultan Kudarat in 1976; east of Davao Oriental in 1943; east of Samar in 1897).,Two earthquakes with a magnitude of 8 occurred in Las Pi\u00f1as in 1645 and in Cagayan in 1627. Four occurred with a magnitude of 7.9: west of Ilocos Sur in 1934; Masbate in 1897; west of Ilocos Norte in 1897; east of Samar in 1897.,Six earthquakes were as strong as the July 16, 1990 tremor, with a magnitude of 7.8: east of Surigao del Norte in 1952 and 1951; Mindoro Oriental in 1942; Surigao del Sur in 1911; Davao Oriental in 1903; Quezon in 1901.,Rappler mapped the strongest earthquakes to hit the country using seismic information dating from as far back as the 1600s, and noted 107 that registered 6.0 or higher on the Richter scale.,The circles in the map represent the epicenters of recorded earthquakes. The darker the circle, the higher the magnitude of the earthquake.,Ring of fire,Dr Arturo Daag of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) told Rappler, that although we cannot predict the next big earthquake, some studies show that \u201c200 years is the return period for another major earthquake in the same area.\u201d,Nearly all the islands, as the map shows, are prone to and have been visited by earthquakes. ,This is partly because the Philippines is located in the Pacific Ocean's \"Ring of Fire,\" which includes about 90% of the world's volcanoes and where a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches and volcanic belts are situated, and plate movements occur.,The Philippines is flanked by the Manila trench and the Philippine trench, both active subduction zones.,This has implications on land use and urban planning, according to Daag.,Hazard maps should, ideally, be used to identify fault lines and areas where it is unsafe to construct buildings. This information should also determine whether or not building permits should be issued to applicants.,According to the recommendation of Phivolcs, buildings must be constructed at least 5 meters away from faults. There are no restrictions in height. An engineer should be able to determine whether or not the ground can support a building of a certain height.,Daag maintained that while Phivolcs recommends policies and measures that address earthquake preparedness and mitigation, it is up to the policymakers to approve them.,Preparedness is key, ,In a country prone to geological hazards, Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum stressed the importance of preparing by knowing what to do and where to go when a disaster strikes. (READ: ,Earthquake tips: what to do before, during and after,),He said the public should do the following in case of an earthquake:,Solidum also encouraged the public to join earthquake drills and to conduct their own earthquake drills at home, in school or in the office.,On Friday, March 27, 2015, various government agencies conducted ,#OplanPagyanig,, a nationwide simultaneous earthquake drill to test the government\u2019s readiness to react in the event of a major quake.,The drill is in anticipation of a 7.2 magnitude earthquake that could be generated ,by movement of the West Valley Fault which, could destroy 40% of buildings, trigger fire in various parts of the city and kill about 35,000 to 40,000 people., ,(WATCH: ,LIVE: #OplanPagyanig: National Earthquake Drill,).,\"Disaster Preparedness should be everybody's business.

Osama bin Laden\u2019s 1996 declaration of war against the United States ends with the dateline, \u201cFriday, August 23, 1996, in the Hindu Kush, Khurusan, Afghanistan.\u201d,Symbol of Victory,After a mob stormed the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya and killed 4 Americans, including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, they raised the black flag. US officials named an al-Qaeda-linked group which they said took advantage of an anti-Islam film protest to launch an attack. ,In a little more than a week, protests spread to more than 20 countries with more than 30 people killed. Black flags were raised by angry mobs in countries like Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen. ,Al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni branch, AQAP (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) has said the attack in Libya was to avenge the June killing of its number two, Abu Yahya al-Libi, and urged Muslims to kill US diplomats in Muslim countries.,Last Thursday, September 20, authorities in the Philippines ,stormed an Abu Sayyaf training camp in Zamboanga City, and freed Chinese hostage, Yuan-Kai Lin. ,During the 20-minute battle, police forces said they wounded Abu Sayyaf leader Khair Mundos, who carries a US$500,000 reward from the US Department of Justice. Mundos managed to escape however.,Mundos was captured in 2004 and confessed he arranged funds for terrorist attacks in Mindanao. Working with his brothers, they funneled money from Saudi Arabia to the Abu Sayyaf, which has had a historical link to al-Qaeda. ,As early as 1988, al-Qaeda's financial network in the Philippines was established by Osama bin Laden\u2019s brother-in-law, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, and al-Qaeda leaders, including the architect of the 9/11 attacks, have trained members of the Abu Sayyaf.,Mundos escaped from a provincial prison in 2007 and headed the Abu Sayyaf group in Basilan. During last week's raid, intelligence sources tell Rappler they found the black flag as well as training manuals from Jemaah Islamiyah, once al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia, inside the camp.,This is not the first time the black flag surfaced in the Philippines. ,Filipinos carry the black flag in the southern Philippines,YouTube campaign,On Nov 6, 2011, a masked Filipino jihadist identified as ,Commander Abu Jihad Khalil al-Rahman al-Luzoni uploaded a video on YouTube, exhorting Muslims around the world to support the jihad in the Philippines. He gave his Arabic message in front of al-Qaeda\u2019s black flag. ,Authorities have since identified him as Khalil Pareja, the leader of the Rajah Solaiman Movement or RSM, a group which worked with Jemaah Islamiyah and the Abu Sayyaf on the Superferry bombing in 2004 and the Valentine's Day bombings in 2005. Using YouTube and Facebook, Pareja took the jihad online and began to work on Facebook with alleged members of al-Shabaab in Somalia and AQAP in Yemen. According to classified documents obtained by Rappler, soon after Pareja was arrested early this year, he told authorities he planned to join the jihad in Yemen, along with other Filipinos.  His Facebook page used the black flag.,Other websites and video messages around the world, including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen prominently display the black flag. In the Philippines, authorities are monitoring a website called ,Islamic Emirate of the Philippines: The Black Flag Movement,. ,One post titled \u201cThe True Islamic Hero,\u201d shows a picture of former AQAP leader Anwar al-Awlaki as well as other al-Qaeda operatives with Arabic titles and translations. It includes links to other extremist websites, including those run by al-Qaeda and its proxies. The site includes news updates as well as photographs of a breakaway faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front led by Ameril Umra Kato, who sheltered leaders of Jemaah Islamiyah or JI.,While all public measuring systems show activity on the site isn\u2019t alarming, it provides a gateway for radicals: there\u2019s a \u201cContact us\u201d portion, an online poll and a donation portal.  Although it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s any real world link to al-Qaeda, it\u2019s clearly inspired by al-Qaeda lore and subculture.,In August, authorities in the Philippines recovered video explaining the black flag inside the laptop of a Malaysian jihadist during an attack targeting the two most wanted Southeast Asian terrorists, JI leaders Marwan and Muawiyah \u2013 ,the targets of the first US smart bomb attack in the Philippines, last February in Jolo. Both escaped and, fled to central Mindanao,.,The Malaysian who owned the laptop with the black flag video arrived in the Philippines in April 2012 and found his way to the central Mindanao camp of Marwan and Muawiyah.  Both escaped again. ,Among the weapons and rocket launchers recovered by authorities, they also found a hardcover book written in English. Its title is \"Islami Emirate Afghanistan.\" Below that was the logo of the Islamic Emirate of the Philippines.,The centralized command structures of both al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah collapsed in the decade after 9/11, but old networks and cells remain continuing to spread its virulent ideology.  Now smaller, more ad hoc and less professional cells carry out attacks without central coordination.  The challenge for authorities is how to contain a social movement that simmers just beneath the surface. -, Rappler.com,(Editor's note: This is the second part of a Rappler series and includes excerpts of ,Maria Ressa\u2019,s upcoming book, \"10 Days, 10 Years: FROM BIN LADEN TO FACEBOOK.\" Set to be published in October, it includes research done for the International Center for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore and the Naval Postgraduate School\u2019s CORE Lab in the US.)", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/13051-al-qaeda", "title": "Al-Qaeda's black flag seized in ASG camp", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/nation/12846-philippine-forces-rescue-chinese-hostage,-kill-kidnappers,http://www.rappler.com/nation/12217-youtube,-facebook-link-filipino-terrorists-to-al-qaeda-amp-global-jihad"},

Nalalaglag sila sa ground floor,\u201d, he added. (Many children either got hurt or died while trying to get out of where they were. They fell to the ground floor.),Faith and science,Surviving without light, food, or water could be a challenge. Sonia believes she was able to get through it because of her faith in God.,\u201cMaybe I survived because I prayed and prayed like I never prayed before\u2026I realized that in moments like this, there\u2019s no one else you can go to, cling to\u2026It boils down to your faith, and a little courage,\u201d said Sonia.,While Sonia thinks her faith in God helped her, she also believes that hiding under that table saved her. , ,A number of times, she had experienced minor earthquakes, yet she claims she still didn\u2019t know what to do.,\u201cAll that I know in my mind was to go under a table. It so happened that at the time there was a table\u2026Probably, the roof or the ceiling did not fall flat. It was inclined.  And [maybe] the one that was killed right away was on the heaviest part and we were here [where there was a gap] and that is why we were saved,\u201d Sonia explained.,The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has been telling the public that the best thing to do when an earthquake strikes is to go under a table to do the duck, cover and hold. (READ: ,What to do before, during, and after an earthquake,), ,Miners will play a role, If the earthquake were to happen today, Tamayo believes miners will be of great help as they were in Baguio in 1990.,\u201cMiners are very important for earthquakes because they are the ones closely prepared to deal with earthquakes, especially when looking underground or at collapsed structures.\u201d Tamayo said.,Students, according to Tamayo should be made \u201caware of what they [miners] do \u2013 the capabilities of miners, because they are used to confined spaces. It\u2019s called confined space rescue.\u201d,Netizens share their experiences,On social media, netizens who experienced the earthquake also shared their experiences.,\n,To those who are old enough, do you remember where you were that afternoon? What was it like? Let us know!,Audie Danao Panaligan, who was a Grade 2 student at the time could still remember how her teacher was saved from a falling blackboard because of the desk in front of it.,\u201cOur teacher told us not to panic, and then the blackboard fell on her but it was cushioned by the desk on the platform so it did not totally hit her,\u201d he recalled.,Jayster Jay, who was 3 years old at the time said they suffered bruises, but were able to survive after hiding under a table.,Benigno Asprec on the other hand was in a La Union-bound jeepney on Marcos highway when the earthquake struck. The driver was supposed to go back, but landslides made it difficult for them. In the end, he just braved the rain and walked to La Union, along with other people.,Did we learn our lessons?,Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum said the 1990 earthquake left 4 valuable lessons:,Meanwhile, netizen Panaligan said most people have not learned their lessons yet, 26 years after the earthquake.,\u201cYes, I have learned my lesson. Sad to say, but most have not. Baguio's Urban and Land Use Planning is a bit terrible. You have houses built right in front of each other in some areas, you cannot even tell the back from the front of the house,\u201d he explained.,\u201cThere is supposed to be an ordinance that says the buildings must not exceed a height of 4 stories or something, and yet after the quake you have structures that are built up to 7 floors right at the city center,\u201d he added.,In a recent report, Baguio City Mayor Mauricio Domogan said the height limit under the zoning ordinance is no longer applicable, citing policy in California in the United States which allows buildings up to 48 stories. California sits on an earthquake-prone area, which features the dreaded San Andreas Fault. (READ: ,Rush to progress? Baguio allows taller buildings after 1990 earthquake,),Domogan cited findings of studies by experts which showed that the destruction of buildings in the 1990 quake was due to alleged poor structural design, thus magnifying the earthquake damage. He said the height of buildings allowed in the city depends on soil tests \u2013 whether the proposed building can be supported by the ground underneath it.,In 1992, around two years after the Luzon earthquake struck, the National Structural Code of the Philippines, which  prescribes requirements to ensure that homes and buildings will not sustain major structural damage when an earthquake strikes, was updated to conform to most recent standards.,Various earthquake drills and information campaigns are also regularly conducted in different parts of the country.,Are we now ready for the \u201cBig One?\u201d \u2013 ,Rappler.com,NEXT: Can your house withstand major earthquakes?", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/99741-faith-science-lessons-1990-luzon-earthquake", "title": "Faith and science: Lessons from the 1990 Luzon earthquake", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/100770-earthquake-preparedness-philippines,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/63417-remembering-1990-luzon-earthquake,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/99569-sonia-roco-eyewitness-1990-luzon-earthquake"},

The area came to be known as the Quezon City Central Business District (QC-CBD).,Now, these 8 families made up of more than 40 Ragua siblings, grandsons, granddaughters and in-laws, are back with a vengeance, requesting the premier investigating arm of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), to investigate the circumstances surrounding the demolition of their houses and their eviction from the prime parcel of land that they claim to be lawfully and rightfully theirs.,They are also questioning the building and business permits granted to these giant malls which have been raking in hundreds of millions of pesos from renting or leasing the property to other business establishments without paying a single centavo to the \"rightful\" landowner.,Amid this investigation, the CIDG invited in February this year at least 7 Quezon City officials to shed light on the Ragua heirs' complaint against city executives. They were asked to explain the legality of the construction and business permits issued to SM North EDSA Mall and Trinoma Complex, an agent privy to the investigation said.,A copy of the 13-page complaint addressed to Senior Superintendent Ronald Lee, CIDG regional chief, dated January 4, 2016, specifically mentioned SM North EDSA and Trinoma Complex as business establishments that have \u201cbeen erected in their property using false and questionable authority, having been issued building permits and business permits by the local government of Quezon City in violation of the law.\u201d,\u201cWe are the lawful heirs of the late Eulalio Ragua, the owner of the Diliman Estate in Quezon City covered by the Original Certificate of Title (OCT) 632,\u201d said Danilo Ragua Lara and Anita A. Lopez in their letter of complaint filed before the CIDG then headed by Director Victor Deona.,The other Ragua heirs gave the two complainants Special Power of Attorney to represent them in the case. Danilo is a grandson of Eulalio Ragua, while Anita is a relative-in-law.,Executive Order,Two executive issuances of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo \u2013 Executive Order No. 620 dated May 4, 2007, and EO 620-A signed on September 11, 2007 \u2013   paved the way for the massive development of QC-CBD.,Both EOs aim to rationalize and speed up the development of East and North Triangles, and the Veterans Memorial area of Quezon City as a well-planned, integrated, and environmentally balanced mixed-use development model. At the same time, Arroyo directed the would-be implementers to respect the rights of the property owners and hammer out deal structures with them.,The said areas are part of the Raguas' land title OCT 632 which won its reconstitution case at Branch 18 of the Court of First Instance (CFI) in Quezon City, only to be reversed 8 years later by the Court of Appeals (CA) and two years later by the Supreme Court (SC). This virtually handed the case on a silver platter to the respondent, J.M. Tuason & Company, Incorporated.  The Ragua case was surprisingly resolved very quickly during the administration of Arroyo, whose husband is a full-blooded Tuason.,Bold move,According to Virgilio T. Pablico, CIDG chief legal officer, the bold move of the Raguas to file complaints was prompted by two recent developments in their investigation.,The first was the recovery of the photostat copy of the Owners Duplicate Certificate of Title, OCT 632, in an entrapment operation.  The second were the findings of the joint investigation of CIDG and PNP Crime Laboratory document experts that the Land Registration Decree \u2013 the basis for the issuance of the Tuasons' OCT 735 \u2013 is a falsified document.,\u201cWith these developments, the owner of the title or his heirs will have the right to pursue their legal action against the holders and possessors of the land in order to recover it,\u201d Pablico added., ,Reconsitution,The two Raguas are representing more than 40 other relatives from the side of the Ragua patriarch. The latter's land title case became famous in the early 1980s when Judge Ernani Cruz Pa\u00f1o of CFI Branch 18 in Quezon City (who later became the Court Administrator of the Supreme Court) ruled in favor of Ragua\u2019s petition for reconstitution of OCT 632, ending the 21-year-old court battle. ,However, the Ragua heirs, who were then considered as squatters on a portion of the property they claimed, were not ready to face the appeal at the Court of Appeals (CA) filed by the two respondents \u2013 J.M.Tuason and the state-run Philippine Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC), the forerunner of National Housing Authority (NHA).,After a long court battle, the Raguas lost at the CA on May 30, 1989. The court sustained the claim of the respondents that there was no basis for reconstitution of the Raguas\u2019 title OCT 632 because the copy of the land title they used as evidence is not the original photo copy and was not even clear enough to be authenticated. The Raguas claim to have lost the original OCT 632 after the war.,With the reversal, the Raguas filed a petition for review with the the Supreme Court, which was denied on January 30, 2000. On February 28 of the same year, they again filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Supreme Court recently denied with finality.,At least 3 other Ragua heirs have chosen to remain as \u201csquatters\u201d in a small portion of the contested lot despite efforts of the Quezon City government to evict them with the other families living in shanties beside the Trinoma complex.,They are still holding their ground because they believe that the issue resolved in the Supreme Court was only the \u201creconstitution\u201d aspect and not the \u201cownership\u201d of the 439-hectare property. ,\u2013 Rappler.com ,Conclusion: ,Part 2: The battle of the land titles", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/156842-part-1-ragua-heirs-quezon-city-land-dispute", "title": "Part 1: 'Rightful' owners of prime lot in QC fight back", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview"},

It was a video of himself, wearing a camouflage jacket and a mask covering his face and head. He was speaking in Arabic and asking Muslims around the world to support and contribute to the jihad in the Philippines.  ,Identified as Commander Abu Jihad Khalil al-Rahman al-Luzoni, the man on the video called on Muslims to unite and help their brethren, saying there was \u201cno way to restore the Islamic Caliphate and the glory of the religion but through jihad.\u201d, ,It was the first of its kind for the Philippines, triggering a wave of videos, letters and audio messages from Filipino jihadists which were promoted on al-Qaeda linked sites and jihadist websites like Shumukh al-Islam and Ansar al-Mujahideen English Forum (AMEF).  ,They declared allegiance to al-Qaeda online and on social networks.  , ,Intelligence sources from 3 different countries told Rappler that Abu Jihad Khalil, the man with the long hair, is 31-year old Khalil Pareja, a Christian convert to Islam who took over the leadership of the Rajah Solaiman Movement (RSM) in 2005.  ,RSM worked closely with the Abu Sayyaf (ASG) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia. Their alliance carried out at least two attacks: the Superferry bombing in 2004, one of the world\u2019s worst maritime terrorist attacks and the second most lethal in Southeast Asia since the 2002 Bali bombing; and the Valentine\u2019s Day bombings in 2005 \u2013 two near-simultaneous explosions in General Santos City and Davao City, followed an hour later by an explosion on a bus in Makati., ,A Philippine intelligence report obtained and verified by Rappler said that Pareja not only posted jihadi materials on YouTube, he was also active on Facebook \u2013 a case study of how one man can connect jihadists and terrorists from multiple countries through social media., ,About a month before he posted his YouTube video, Pareja told authorities he joined the Arabic Student Forum on Facebook. Several of the members asked him if he knew Abu Jihad, but he said he was cautious about security. Then he received a private message (PM) from a man who introduced himself as Gerald. They became friends and started chatting regularly., ,Over time, Gerald told Pareja he was a member of al-Shabaab, Islamist militants who control much of southern Somalia. The relationship between al-Shabaab and al-Qaeda dates back to the 1990\u2019s.,Most lethal affiliate,It seems Osama bin Laden\u2019s death in 2011 helped pave the way for ,closer ties between the two groups,. In February 2012, al-Shabaab\u2019s leadership pledged allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who replaced bin Laden as al-Qaeda\u2019s new leader. This was announced on a video uploaded on the Internet by al-Qaeda\u2019s media arm. ,This agreement showed that despite bin Laden\u2019s death, al-Qaeda continues to grow., ,Pareja told Gerald he was Abu Jihad. Gerald invited him to go to Yemen to join the jihad led by al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni affiliate, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP. Counterterrorism analysts characterize AQAP as the ,\u201cmost active and lethal Qaeda affiliate, intent on striking at both the US homeland and regional targets.\u201d,  , ,In mid-2012, US authorities used a CIA sting operation to foil an AQAP plot to bomb US-bound airplanes with explosives hidden in the bodies of terrorists. Experts said AQAP\u2019s master bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, had been working on body bombs, explosives surgically implanted in either the stomach or rectal cavity. ,AQAP was also involved in other foiled plots against US targets,: the \u201cunderwear bomb\u201d used in an attempt to take down Northwest Flight 253 in 2009 and the \u201cprinter bombs\u201d in the failed cargo bomb plot in 2010., ,One of its leaders, American Anwar al-Awlaki was a ,\u201cmaster in the use of the Internet.\u201d, And although he was killed by the US in 2011, his messages continue to resonate and win recruits online.  ,Awlaki was prolific on YouTube; among those he influenced were the London attackers who carried out Britain\u2019s 9/11 on July 7, 2005 (commonly referred to as 7/7). He had his own website (now taken down by authorities) which attracted extremists and the head of AQAP, bin Laden\u2019s secretary, Nasir al-Wuhaishi. He consulted bin Laden and appointed Awlaki the head of AQAP\u2019s external operations, in charge of terrorist attacks outside Yemen and Saudi Arabia.,Awlaki was a cyberworld superstar because he was an eloquent speaker, and he understood the virtual world. His ideas remain with AQAP, which continues his online recruitment efforts., ,Pareja said Gerald told him AQAP \u201chad established an Islamic state in the province of Abian in Yemen\u201d and had already recruited \u201cFilipinos studying from the Islamic schools in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Sudan.\u201d  He asked Pareja to join the jihad in Yemen and help lead the Filipinos. He said they would stay in Yemen for 10 years.  ,After 5 years, they could choose to return to the Philippines, at which point AQAP \u201cwould provide them funds to continue jihad to establish an Islamic Caliphate.\u201d Gerald offered to pay for Pareja\u2019s travel expenses to Yemen. Pareja accepted the offer and was scheduled to travel between April and June of 2012. , ,He never made it because Filipino authorities arrested him on March 1.  , ,Today, the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaeda has been degraded but it has evolved and grown into a social movement.

If it's just simply ash, the danger is you can be suffocated by the ash, you can still die. But if it's fragments being thrown out by the volcano it would be good to have hard hats.

Sonia Roco is trapped at the second floor of Hotel Nevada for about two days. Photo from Phivolcs     ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The morning of Monday, July 16, 1990 was unusually hot for Baguio, Sonia Roco recalled.  ,The widow of the late Senator Raul Roco was in the City of Pines that fateful day, 26 years ago, to attend a two-day seminar organized by United States Agency for International Development (USAID).,SURVIVOR. Sonia Roco, widow of the late Senator Raul Roco is able to survive after almost two days of being trapped on the second floor of Hotel Nevada. Photo screengrabbed from Youtube   ,The event was held at the second floor of the Hotel Nevada, a luxurious hotel located right across the main gate of Camp John Hay. Representatives of civil society groups from different parts of the country participated in the workshop, which was supposed to train these groups on how to handle grant funds.,Roco was there as executive director of the Bicol Livelihood Project, the foundation she organized to support her husband while he was congressman of the 2nd District of Camarines Sur. She was accompanied by Peachie, her sister-in-law.,Little did they know that later that day, a magnitude-7.8 earthquake would hit Northern and Central Luzon and destroy the 6-story hotel where their workshop was being held.,The 1990 Luzon earthquake, whose epicenter was near the town of Rizal, in Nueva Ecija province, devastated the cities of Baguio, Dagupan and Pangasinan, killing about 2,412 people.,45 seconds,It happened almost half an hour after the seminar participants were allowed by the organizers to take a break, Sonia recalled.,At 4:26 pm, while participants were taking their merienda, the whole hotel started to shake. Sonia was near the dining hall, just a few steps from the dining table where the food was being served, when the shaking happened.,LIQUEFACTION. Parts of Dagupan mostly affected by liquefaction. Photo from Phivolcs  ,She recalled seeing the chandelier fall. Seminar papers got scattered on the floor. People around her were panicking.,As soon as she felt the shaking, Sonia took two steps to the long seminar table near the dining hall so she could take cover under it. Near the table where the tea was being served, a man initially just stood there with his arms opened wide, in shock about what was happening.,The shaking went on for 45 seconds. Then, there was darkness. \u201cThat was my last figure of somebody (that I recalled),\u201d she said. Sonia, then 46 years old, later learned that the man survived the catastrophe. \u201cHe ran out really fast.\u201d She, on the other hand, was trapped in the rubble for almost 2 days.  ,No way out,After the shaking, the floor above them collapsed, causing the table where Sonia was hiding to be broken in half. On her back was a man who died instantly, she recalled.,Three were trapped under that table: a woman named Mia, who was two months pregnant, the dead man, and Sonia. On the other side was her sister-in-law, Peachie. Sonia remembered being able to talk to Peachie hours after they were trapped in the rubble.,\u201cShe told me, \u2018,Nakatuwad ako, naipit ang paa ko,.\u201d (I\u2019m on my fours. My feet are stuck.),Around her, Sonia heard weird gurgling sounds and screaming people.,PANCAKED. The Baguio Park Hotel after the magnitude-7.8 earthquake hit Northern and Central Luzon. Photo from Phivolcs     ,\u201cIt was dark,\u201d she recalled. She started groping to get a feel of the things around her. \u201cI felt the papers. The electric fan went inside the table. The chairs [also] went inside, so it sort of gave support. The vase was here, and then outside of the table frame, when you put out your legs, it\u2019s already the ceiling that fell. Then at the back, I knew there was somebody who instantly died,\u201d Sonia said, describing what she remembered.,\u201cYou open your eyes, you close your eyes, it\u2019s all black,\u201d Sonia said. ,Because someone on the other side of the floor had a flashlight, Sonia and the other survivors were initially able to keep track of the time. But it wasn\u2019t long until the battery of the flashlight ran out.,Totally cut off from the outside world, Sonia had no idea of the extent of the damage the earthquake had caused. \u201cIn my mind, when it struck, I said this is only an earthquake. I thought it was just specific to our building. I said, just be calm. Be calm,\u201d said Sonia.,Under the table where she was trapped, Sonia had to stay crouched on all fours for a long time because the space was so small. When she got tired, she was forced to lie down and rest her head on the ankle of the dead man.,\"The first thing I thought of was my family,\" she recalled. \"[I thought] will I ever see them again? All I could do was pray and surrender them to God.\" She did that for many hours, until she heard the sound of helicopters.,More and more shaking,Outside, rescue groups were working hard to locate and rescue survivors. Since there had been no earthquakes in the area for years, however, they were quite in shock as well.,A number of structures collapsed within the city burying many people alive. Apart from the Nevada Hotel, other establishments destroyed included the Hyatt Terraces Plaza, the Baguio Hilltop Hotel, Baguio Park Hotel, and FRB Hotel.,It is estimated that as many as ,1,000 people were trapped and killed, in damaged buildings within Baguio City that day.,\u201c,Kakaiba. First time mo makakita ng collapsed structure\u2026,\u201d (It was extraordinary, my |first time to see a collapsed structure), Colonel Jeff Tamayo, the one who led the Philippine Military Academy\u2019s rescue operations in Baguio Park Hotel and University of Baguio, recalled.,\u201c,Magugulat ka eh., Suddenly all of that is washed away or taken away from you. So how are you gonna respond?\u201d (You\u2019ll be shocked. Suddenly all of that is washed away or taken away from you. So how are you gonna respond?),CRUSHED. The Baguio Hilltop Hotel right behind the Baguio City Public Market. Photo from Phivolcs  ,The massive quake shocked a lot of people, Tamayo said. \u201cWe are trained, but we were still in shock.\u201d,Unprepared for the massive destruction, rescuers only brought with them basic tools like shovels and sticks. The non-stop aftershocks and continuous rains made everything more difficult.,\u201c,Pag nagkaka-aftershock, mayanig masyado, ,so we tended to run out [then go back again],...\u201d (Every time there was an aftershock, it became really shaky so we tended to run out then go back again) Tamayo recalls. He said they were forced to stay on the fourth floor of the University of Baguio.,\u201c,Sabi ko nga sa mga kadete, kung gagawin namin ito lagi, baka malaglag tayo sa ground kasi nasa fourth floor yun. Siguro, dito na lang tayo. Tuwing magkaka-aftershock, magti-tinginan na lang kami. Kung baga, ano pang magagawa natin kaysa malaglag tayo sa ground floor,\u201d, Tamayo explained.,(If we're going to do this again and again, I told the cadets, we might fall to the ground, because it was on the fourth floor. Let\u2019s just stay here. So every time an aftershock would occur, we would just look at each other. What else could we do?),Miners helped,One group that contributed a lot to the rescue effort were the community of miners from nearby mining companies who pitched in to help rescuers bring out the survivors.,\u201cMiners are used to confined spaces,\u201d Tamayo explained. \u201cCollapsed structures for them [are] like going under a tunnel. \u201cThey operate in such inhumane [conditions]. They were very acclimatized.\u201d,\u201cThe miners were very strong and I\u2019m very, very proud of them,\u201d Tamayo said.,Meanwhile, personnel and officials of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) also had difficulty because the agency did not have advanced tools yet.,Sent to Baguio to assess the damage, the Phivolcs team also had difficulty making their way through the city. ,Bartolome Bautista, Seismology division head at that time, said the only way they were able to communicate with officers in their seismological stations in Baguio was through a radio.,\u201cBaguio was totally isolated and communication was cut off for hours [after the earthquake]. It was also raining at that time so the Department of Public Works and Highways had to clear the roads first,\u201d Bautista said.,Sonia\u2019s rescue,Back at the Nevada Hotel, Sonia recalled hearing helicopters flying all over the place for the first time the morning after the earthquake hit.,At around 8 to 10 am, Sonia started hearing rescuers pounding on the building. Trapped victims had to stop them because the more the rescuers pounded, the more they were being trapped.,At around 6 pm of July 17, volunteers had to leave the hotel because of the non-stop aftershocks. It took a while for rescue efforts to resume.,\u201cWe felt we were abandoned. Nobody was talking to us anymore. That was [a] long, long, long, long [time] \u2013 until around midnight, [when] we heard people near us [again],\u201d Sonia said.,At 12 midnight of Wednesday, July 18, volunteers from the Benguet Mining Corporation arrived at the Nevada Hotel and started rescue operations from the basement. Victims who were saved helped the miners by describing the layout of the second floor. Sonia finally heard her husband\u2019s voice.,TOTALLY DAMAGED. The Hyatt Terraces Plaza right beside a building that has not collapsed. Photo from Phivolcs ,\u201cWow, what that contact was, really. It sort of made me cry. Among us, there was a written code [among the survivors] that nobody should break down, but apparently I broke down [when I heard his voice],\u201d Sonia said.,But it took 3 more hours before rescuers were able to get near her. At 3 am of July 18, rescuers were able to bore a hole up to the point beside Sonia\u2019s foot. Their group was given bottles of water to sip. Mia, the pregnant woman, was the first to get out.,When it was Sonia\u2019s turn to be pulled out, a really strong aftershock occurred, causing the rescuers to leave. They came back 20 minutes later.,Finally at 4 am on July 18, rescuers were able to get Sonia out. By that time, Peachie was no longer breathing.,\u201cBefore I jumped off, I asked the people in the area how Peachie was. I said, check the pulse. They said, 'No more na, no more.' My question that time was 'Why was I saved and not Peachie?\u2019\u201d Roco said.,Massive destruction,The Rocos rode an ambulance to get to the nearest hospital while the miners stayed to help other victims. When she reached the nearest hospital, Sonia noticed that everybody was out on the roads because of non-stop aftershocks.,It wasn\u2019t until they were on a helicopter that Sonia realized how strong the earthquake was.,\u201cRaul was fast asleep, while I was looking [below] and I saw how massive the destruction was. There were buildings on fire,\u201d said Sonia.,Many of those who attended the USAID workshop perished under the rubble of the Nevada Hotel. Only 10, including Sonia, survived. \u2013 ,with reports from Gwen de la Cruz/Rappler.com, ,Next: Faith and science: Lessons from the 1990 Luzon Earthquake, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/99569-sonia-roco-eyewitness-1990-luzon-earthquake", "title": "Sonia Roco: Eyewitness to the 1990 Luzon earthquake", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/nation/171512-duterte-peace-corridor-marawi-milf,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/63417-remembering-1990-luzon-earthquake,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview"},

Soon, it will also deliver information about other hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, storm surges, and tsunamis, he said.,\"NOAH basically wants to deliver accurate, reliable, and timely information that's to empower communities,\" he said.,Soon, sensors from all parts of the country will send information on rainfall, temperature, water levels, and other relevant data to the website, giving an overview of conditions from the national up to the local level.,But NOAH isn't just useful for disasters. For everyday activities, people can turn to the website to determine if it will rain in their area, without waiting for the latest PAGASA bulletin.,It is also a tool that can be used for development planning. Lagmay said they are slowly working to change people's mindsets about disasters.,Filipinos currently treat disasters as one-off events; but in reality, he said, disasters are results of failing to plan ahead. The project aims to give local governments, companies, and individuals informationto help them plan ahead and lessen damage and casualties from disasters.,Everyone involved,Project NOAH will also allow local governments, the private sector, and most especially citizens to participate in disaster risk reduction and management efforts.,\"We need everyone to participate - we need the private sector, we need the civil society organizations, we need the media, we need the government institutions, we need the communities, we need the LGUs, we need the individuals to participate,\" Lagmay said.,The project brings together experts from 21 institutions, both from the public and private sector, including PAGASA, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, several universities, and even media and the 3 major telecommunication companies.,Dr Alfredo Mahar Lagmay, executive director of the NOAH project, speaking during an interview on Rappler's #TalkThursday program, June 28, 2012.,The project also has information dissemination and education components to help people understand the various uses of the project.,They are starting an extensive information campaign, first for the website, then for the program in general, starting with the \"Talakayan\" disaster caravan in cooperation with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).,To educate more people, they will also have instructional videos through DOST, and plans to integrate use of the maps among communities.,They will also have different methods of information dissemination, including SMS, internet, social media, and broadcast media. They are also eyeing technologies such as \"super WiFi,\" which utilizes unused broadcast wavelengths to spread information.,Culture of safety,The project is only 2 months old, and the timeline for full implementation runs until 2013, but it is slowly catching the attention of netizens, local governments, and private groups.,In the case of Marikina, Lagmay said the people in charge of disaster response in the city turned to the NOAH website to check rainfall and water levels in the Marikina River.,That night, they were able to monitor water levels at the Montalban station rising to \"critical\" levels between 5pm to 9pm. People at the city hall closely monitored the situation, fearing a repeat of the events of October 2009. And because of additional information about weather, rainfall probability, and cloud movements, they saw that the rain would stop soon.,On Monday morning, the disaster officials saw clouds moving away, and water levels going back to normal.,\"So rather than sounding off the alarm to evacuate, they had a handle of the situation, have access to real-time information, and that information was used in their decision-making process,\" he said.,Hopefully, Project NOAH will help Filipinos lead a culture of safety, with people more conscious about disasters and how to confront and address the challenges we face. This change in mindset is a crucial factor for the project to be successful, the geologist and disaster expert said.,\"It should be an effort that should be participated in by everybody, not just by the government, because no government agency or group of agencies can handle the disaster problems that we face,\" Lagmay said.,\"That's the only way by which a good and effective disaster management and mitigation program would work,\" he added.,\"No matter what the government says and does, when the people don't listen and don't do their responsibility, then all efforts of government, including NOAH, will be in vain,\" said Lagmay. -, Rappler.com,Elsewhere in Rappler: ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/7758-project-noah-advocating-a-culture-of-safety", "title": "Project NOAH: Advocating a culture of safety", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017"},

The darker the color is, the more dangerous it gets.\n,MANILA, Philippines - Every year, around 20 tropical cyclones visit the country, making flood a perennial problem for Filipinos.,In 2012, state weather bureau Pagasa released a new set of color-coded rainfall advisories. It is composed of 3 colors: Yellow, Orange and Red. The darker the color is, the more dangerous it gets.,Below is an infographic explaining Pagasa's rainfall advisories., ,What do the colors mean?,Yellow,  ,This means heavy rainfall of 7.5 - 15 mm in an hour is observed and is expected to continue for the next 2 hours. This can be equivalent to 2 gallons of rain per square meter per hour. ,When Pagasa gives yellow advisory, it means that residents in affected areas should continue monitoring their weather condition. Flooding for low-lying areas is possible.,Orange, ,This means intense rainfall of 15-30mm in an hour is observed and is expected to continue for the next 2 hours. This can be equivalent to 4 to 8 gallons of rain per square meter per hour. ,When Pagasa gives orange advisory, it means that residents in affected areas should be on alert for possible evacuation. Flooding in affected areas is expected.,Red, ,This means torrential rainfall of more than 30mm in an hour is observed and is expected to continue for the next 2 hours. This can be equivalent to 8 gallons of rain per square meter per hour.,Continuous rainfall of more than 65mm for 3 hours can also prompt Pagasa to give this advisory.,When Pagasa gives red advisory, it means that severe flooding in low lying areas is expected and residents should start evacuating.,Stay tuned for advisories,Stay tuned for Pagasa\u2019s advisory by visiting their ,official website,.

This means that there is flooding in areas where the water reaches.,The flood scenario per river basin is updated every 10 minutes.,Why look at the river basins?,River basins, play a major role in possible flooding in an area. Every time there is rain, the rainwater normally goes to the rivers, then eventually to the seas. But if the rainfall is too much, then the river basin may spill and cause flooding in low-lying areas near it.,\"Pag pinagaaralan mo yung ,flooding, [sa lugar mo], siyempre yung pag-ulan doon sa kabilang ,river basin will not affect, yung analysis mo ng flooding doon sa [river] basin na pinag-aaralan mo,\", (When you analayze flooding [in your area], of course, the rainfall situation in other basins will not affect your analysis on the [river] basin in your area) Dr. Mahar Lagmay, executive director of Project Noah said.,The new color-coded advisories aim to help local governments and their communities to prepare for floods, landslides, and dam spills. ,For more information on Project Noah, watch these two 10-minute Project Noah website tutorial videos that Lagmay prepared., ,- Rappler.com,Sources: ,Malaca\u00f1ang's official website,, ,Pagasa official website,, ,Project Noah,, various news websites, ,If you have any questions, feedback, or additional information, please email move.ph@rappler.com or tweet ,@moveph,.,Get the latest ,#WeatherAlert, and typhoon updates on ,Project Agos,. , ,Project Agos is a collaborative platform that combines top-down government action with bottom-up civic engagement to help communities learn about climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.

I picked Duterte for the simple reason that I wanted to see Davao City and he sounded like a \"fun\" person to cover. ,All I knew about him then was that he had a tough-guy image and a reputation for being a strict mayor. ,(READ:, 22 things to know about 'Duterte Harry',),I first met Duterte on September 29, 2015 in Davao City. That same day, he invited me to join his other guests in his favorite karaoke joint. I drank beer as he sipped coffee beside me. We could barely hear each other over the sound system. A few hours later, I found myself, in his house,, taking photos of his bathroom., , ,My first impression then was that Duterte was the kind of politician I had never encountered before. I was shocked by how easily he invited me to his house, despite having met me only hours ago.

At the very least, it might make you wonder or laugh., 1. ,He\u2019s late 90% of the time.,And I don\u2019t mean 30 minutes late or an hour late. A couple of times, he\u2019s been 6 hours late (such as during a concert in Taguig). Reporters covering him know that if his itinerary says he\u2019ll arrive at a certain time, expect to see him in 3 to 4 hours. ,Some reporters have been so frustrated that they ask him why he is late during ambush interviews. His answers range from flight delays, to traffic, to too many people wanting to take their photos with him. ,But I notice he\u2019s on time for events like presidential debates and fora with businessmen and students., ,2. He doesn\u2019t mind sharing his food.,Usually, the only time Duterte gets to eat is during chopper or car rides in between sorties. One time, I was able to ride with him in a chopper from Maasin to Ormoc in Leyte.,QUIET MOMENT. Duterte savors a moment of peace during a chopper ride in between sorties in Leyte.

One drink Duterte seems to always have in a cooler on the campaign trail is Vita Coco coconut water.

He gave the carton to me with the advice, \u201cHydration is very important.\u201d ,I took several sips when Go handed him another carton, this time much colder. Suddenly, Duterte grabbed the lukewarm carton I was drinking from and handed me his chilled carton. ,He then gestured to his sore throat and said he preferred the warmer drink. He drank from my half-empty carton without a moment\u2019s hesitation., ,4. He\u2019s nocturnal.,'ZZZ.' Duterte's campaign team has had to adjust to his unusual body clock. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,Davaoe\u00f1os no doubt have heard of Duterte\u2019s body clock. He typically wakes up at 6 pm and holds office until the wee hours of the morning, then sleeps at 5 am. It must be hard to kick the habit which explains why his rallies usually start at 3 pm and end past midnight.,Compare this to candidates like Mar Roxas or Jejomar Binay who start their days as early as 8 am. Members of his campaign team have told me Duterte sleeps like a rock and when he decides to stay in bed for a little while longer, they can\u2019t refuse him. \u201cHe\u2019s 71 years old after all,\u201d they tell me sheepishly., ,5. He can be a gentleman.,DUTERTE AND WOMEN. Duterte holds a crying girl in his arms during a Palawan sortie. Photo by Duterte-Cayetano Media Team ,Yes, he\u2019s ,locked lips with women supporters, and has made several ,sexist remarks, and offensive jokes. But he has surprised me quite a number of times by helping me down a vehicle and even using his arms to keep me from being crushed by a stampede. One time, during a Cavite motorcade, he asked my permission if he could move his face a bit closer to mine because he couldn\u2019t hear what I was saying amidst the screaming crowd.,6. He has a very small circle of trusted advisers., ,GUEST SPEAKER. Duterte attends #TheLeaderIWant Forum in DLSU on January 20, 2016. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,Though his campaign team is a hodge-podge of volunteer groups, very few people in the campaign have a direct line to Duterte. Even his spokespersons are not able to pin him down long enough to coordinate their messaging, sometimes depending on media for direct quotes of the mayor on certain issues. ,Among the select few he listens to are childhood friends like Sonny and Paul Dominguez and Jesus Dureza, his campaign manager Jun Evasco, and political strategist Lito Banayo.,7. Depending on your mood (and his), he is the worst or most fun person to interview.,Worst because when he doesn\u2019t like a question, he won\u2019t give you a straight answer, preferring to respond with a joke. ,One time, he was asked which bills he would certify as urgent first if he becomes president. ,His reply: \u201cA law protecting beautiful women like you.\u201d ,Asked about where the P227 million he has been accused of not declaring came from, he said it may have come from rich friends of his. Pressed for a clarification, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re saying, not me. You said the money was deposited on my birthday. So I must have rich friends.\u201d,But when he wants to be, Duterte can be clear as day, spitting out such sensational soundbites as \u201cMar is the most incompetent Filipino\u201d or \u201cIf you bring drugs to my city, I\u2019ll make your balls explode.\u201d,8. In front of a crowd, he speaks non-stop.,If you don't stop him, Duterte will just keep talking. (READ:, 12 elements of a Rodrigo Duterte speech,),The most recent example of this is during his May 2 guesting at his friend Pastor Apollo Quiboloy's television show. Asked about his Zamboanga rallies that day, he spoke for a good 46 minutes before one of the hosts decided it was time to ask him a second question. (READ: ,Rodrigo Duterte's little timekeeper,), During these almost-ramblings, I've been surprised to hear him talk about things like tuna migration patterns, the history of Filipino-Spanish surnames (and why people with names like Batongbacal or Tatlonghari had rebellious ancestors), and contintental shelves. Don't get him started on 1521.,9. But in his moments alone, he is quiet.,If he's talkative in front of a crowd, he's quiet in private. If you don't ask him a question, he'll most likely spend a car ride or chopper ride in silence, looking at the view or taking a small nap.,10. He's uncomfortable around an upper-class crowd.,TALKING BUSINESS. Duterte shakes hands with Ayala Corp CEO Jaime Zobel de Ayala during a Makati Business Club forum.

Two out of the 3 times I know Duterte read his speech was during an ,Asia CEO forum, and a, Makati Business Club forum,.

As she looks serenely around the rest of the hall from her perch, she appears like a woman comfortable in her own skin, and her new public role.,Avance\u00f1a has come a long way since ,February 3, 2016,, the day she accompanied Duterte for the first time in a campaign sortie when he was still a candidate and the presidency only a distant hope.,That hot day at the University of the Philippines Diliman campus, some of the journalists covering the event (a meet-up with militant farmer groups) did not even know Avance\u00f1a was Duterte\u2019s common-law wife., ,Clad in a yellow and black printed dress and wearing make-up that had melted from the afternoon heat, Avance\u00f1a was at first shy to talk to media. But a few questions in, she had warmed up to the interview and began answering them with the finesse the current Presidential Communications Operations Office might learn a thing or two from.,Watch her interview here:,Today, Avance\u00f1a is no stranger to the public eye. She only recently began to embrace her role as Duterte\u2019s \u201clong-time partner,\u201d gracing state dinners, hosting visiting First Ladies, and accompanying the President to official foreign trips., ,Let\u2019s take a look at Avance\u00f1a\u2019s transformation, from quiet campaign companion to Duterte\u2019s stunning \u2013 and influential \u2013 red carpet partner., ,Where it all began,Honeylet, whose real name is Cieleto, was a quiet and calming presence for Duterte back in the 2016 campaign season.,In sorties she would attend, clad in practical shirt and pants, she occasionally spoke to media but never gave speeches on stage to promote her candidate-husband. The most she would do was to throw out campaign shirts and Duterte-Cayetano ballers during a motorcade. She sometimes brought along with her their pre-teen daughter Veronica or \u201cKitty\u201d., ,CAMPAIGN TRAIL. Honeylet Avance\u00f1a and her daughter Kitty join Duterte's motorcade in Malabon during the 2016 campaign season. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/ Rappler  ,Fast forward to the ,break of dawn on May 10,, hours after election day, when her husband\u2019s victory was sealed by 16 million votes, an exhausted but happy Avance\u00f1a was to be found backstage at Pastor Apollo Quiboloy\u2019s television studio in Davao City where her husband was being interviewed., ,Her make-up worn out by the frenzy of activities and an impatient Kitty tugging at her arm, Avance\u00f1a was now concerning herself with the kind of ,barong, her picky husband would agree to wear during his presidency., ,A month later, Avance\u00f1a, sat down with Rappler ,to talk about changes in her life she would expect with a president for a partner. She had obviously recuperated from the intense campaign. Her hair sported light brown highlights. ,That night, Avance\u00f1a said she was determined for two things to remain unchanged: she would have a life separate from her husband\u2019s presidency and she would stay low-key and behind the scenes.,\u201c,Hindi ko naman talaga kailangan nasa public eye\u2026Nasa likod lang ako, alalay lang ako sa personal niya,,\u201d she had said. (I don\u2019t really need to be in the public eye\u2026 I\u2019ll just be in the background, his helper in personal matters.),Avance\u00f1a has enough of her own life to attend to, without her husband's presidency. The former high school valedictorian is an accomplished businesswoman who supplies meat to Davao City malls and owns 11 Mister Donut franchises.,True enough, Avance\u00f1a was content to stay under the radar during major events like Duterte\u2019s oath-taking and his first State of the Nation Address. While she attended, she didn\u2019t walk beside Duterte on the red carpet.,During the oath-taking ceremony, the place beside the new president, usually reserved for First Ladies, was taken by his 4 children. , ,The move was seen as a way to skirt the delicate issue of Duterte\u2019s annulment with his wife Elizabeth Zimmerman and his not being married to Avance\u00f1a.,But in the last few months of Duterte\u2019s presidency, the country watched as Avance\u00f1a gradually took on a more public role.,VISION IN FUSCHIA. Honeylet Avance\u00f1a sits beside Indonesian President Joko Widodo during a state dinner held in his honor. Presidential photo  ,In January, Avance\u00f1a had a starring role in the first-ever state dinner hosted by Duterte, the dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. A vision in white and gold, Avance\u00f1a sat beside Abe while Japanese First Lady Akie Abe sat beside Duterte.,When the Abes went to Davao City the day after, Avance\u00f1a was ,Mrs Abe\u2019s host,, bringing her to Japanese monuments and landmarks there., ,Avance\u00f1a would again sit with foreign leaders in two other state dinners \u2013 for Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and Indonesian President Joko Widodo., ,Grace on the red carpet,But it was in April when she took on her most public role yet \u2013 as Duterte\u2019s, partner in welcoming heads of state, to the 30th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit held at the Philippine International Convention Center., ,It was Avance\u00f1a\u2019s most high-profile international event to date., ,She appeared graceful yet modest beside Duterte on the red carpet, wearing an understated black lace dress under a green blazer.,HAND-HOLDING. President Duterte gives his hand to Honeylet Avance\u00f1a minutes before he welcomes ASEAN leaders to the ASEAN Summit. Presidential photo  , ,There was a touching moment, minutes before the ASEAN leaders began walking in, when Duterte asked Avance\u00f1a to feel his hand. It looked like the President was getting last-minute assurance from his partner that he would get through the day just fine., ,As the leaders and their First Ladies approached, Avance\u00f1a was ready with a warm smile and pleasantries. She cut a fine figure, offering a woman\u2019s soft touch beside a President known for his macho brashness., ,The month of May brought another first for Avance\u00f1a. She and Kitty went on their, first presidential trip, to Cambodia, Hong Kong, and China. She looked every inch a First Lady as she and Duterte stepped out of the plane and onto the red carpet rolled out for them by the Cambodian government.,WELCOME CEREMONY. Flowers await President Duterte and Honeylet Avance\u00f1a upon their arriving in Beijing in May 2017. Presidential photo\n,Wearing a blue and green printed dress and sensible grey heels, Avance\u00f1a accepted with open arms the orange flowers offered to her as a welcome gift. That same trip, she and Kitty, visited a hospital and several tourist attractions, in Phnom Penh, care of their host, the Cambodian government., ,Days later, Avance\u00f1a would meet even more world leaders at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, where she attended the welcome dinner with Duterte and the, spouses' program,. She and Kitty would again fly with Duterte to Moscow, Russia, later that month., ,Avance\u00f1a has been taking on so many tasks usually given to first ladies that even Palace photographers and captioners ,mistakenly called her \u201cFirst Lady\u201d, in a photo release. Within hours, the Palace sent an email correcting the caption, replacing the title with \u201clongtime partner.\u201d,Life of a first lady,For former first lady Amelita \u201cMing\u201d Ramos, having a first lady by his side could be of great help to President Duterte., ,\u201cIt would help because our people still listen to women and it will help if she could do more, if she were first lady,\u201d Ramos told Rappler, referring to Avance\u00f1a., ,SHARING WISDOM. Rappler talks to Mrs Amelita Ramos about her experience as First Lady. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler ,Mrs Ramos, wife of former president Fidel Ramos, was known as a \u201clow-key\u201d first lady who loved sports, particularly badminton, and involved herself in several advocacies, including the rehabilitation of Pasig River and promotion of indigenous arts.,Duterte has often expressed admiration for Ramos' husband, one of the influential voices who convinced him to run for president. ,For Mrs Ramos, Duterte should marry Avance\u00f1a, who has been with him \u201cfor so long.\u201d,\u201cWell, he should marry already this girl he\u2019s been with for how many years, but that\u2019s all up to him,\u201d she said., ,Having a first lady helps presidents by making them appear \u201cstable\u201d in their personal lives, said Ramos.,But title or no title, there are many ways Avance\u00f1a can help Duterte, especially when adding some feminine sensibleness to his famous uncouthness.,\u201cYou can tell your husband, that tie doesn\u2019t look good. Jeans, you shouldn\u2019t wear that,\u201d said Mrs Ramos.,Helping in these small details has been part of her experience as first lady. She recalled President Ramos\u2019 visit to Brunei where they were told by protocol staff that it\u2019s considered bad manners there to cross legs.,\u201cSo I had to remind my husband, don\u2019t cross your leg ,ha,,\u201d shared Ramos.,SOCIALS. Honeylet Avance\u00f1a joins the family photo of country leaders and their spouses during the Belt and Road Forum welcome dinner in Beijing. Presidential photo ,Could Avance\u00f1a, for instance, influence Duterte to stop ,chewing gum, in front of foreign dignitaries, as he did in the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping during his October state visit? (READ: ,Duterte told of protocol: 'You do it for the country',),Being first lady is no walk in the park, though there is glamor when you are married to the most powerful man in the country, as Imelda Marcos so spectacularly showed., ,Making the position even trickier is that there are no rules to being first lady., ,\u201cThere is no job description for a first lady\u2026 There\u2019s nothing written. You have to decide yourself,\u201d said Mrs Ramos.,Nothing in the Constitution or other laws of the land specify the role of the \"First Spouse\" or their tasks. As such, no budget is set aside for them.,Mrs Ramos would hold fund-raisers for her advocacies. She also kept her job in an international school to pay for the outfits she wore to formal events.,And as with every public role, there will be criticisms., ,One day, she got a letter from someone criticizing her for the way she walked.,\u201cI get a letter telling me I should improve the way I walk, I walk like a duck. So that\u2019s the way I am, so that\u2019s it,\u201d said Mrs Ramos.,TOUR. While President Rodrigo Duterte attends the World Economic Forum, Honeylet and Kitty go sight-seeing and visit a hospital. Presidential photo ,She became so conscious of what other people might think that she thought twice about wearing a set of ruby jewelry given to her by the sultan of Qatar.,She wore the set of necklace, earrings, bracelet, and ring only once.,\u201cI felt so conscious because I was thinking, \u2018Wow, people will say, before, she did not wear that. How come she has that now?\u2019 It was only one time I wore that and never again,\u201d said Mrs Ramos.,Soft power,But public attention on her personal life with FVR became even more pronounced with the increasing influence on him by his mistress ,Rose Marie \u201cBaby\u201d Arenas,.,Arenas maintained a high profile during the Ramos administration doing philanthropic work, organizing concerts such as opera star Pavarotti\u2019s, and gracing magazine covers., ,Today, Mrs Ramos waves off the affair, but seems uncomfortable with the topic. Asked how she dealt with Arenas then, she said, \u201cNothing. I\u2019m still the first lady unless I divorce my husband.\u201d,Compared to Fidel Ramos, Duterte is much more open about his ,being a womanizer and a flirt,., ,In the presidential campaign, he admitted he had at least two girlfriends, though he was already living with Avance\u00f1a and their daughter.,Avance\u00f1a, when asked to comment about this, was cool as a cat as she smiled and said, \u201cThat was before. He\u2019s 70 already.\u201d,But Avance\u00f1a herself had once been the \u201cother woman.\u201d Duterte courted her while he was still married to Elizabeth Zimmerman, mother of his 3 older children.,TRAVEL COMPANION. President Rodrigo Duterte gets his barong tagalog fixed by his partner Honeylet, with daughter Kitty looking on, before disembarking to start his Cambodia visit. Presidential photo ,The job of first lady is a position of power, since, as the President\u2019s spouse, first ladies can influence the chief executive in a way no other person can.,Mrs Ramos agrees with this. Other people recognized the power she had. One time, a Chinese tycoon supposedly visited their home on Arlegui Street, just outside Malaca\u00f1ang Palace, to meet with her., ,She never knew what the businessman wanted because as soon as the former president saw him, he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t deal with my wife!\u201d,Avance\u00f1a, whether first lady or not, already wields that power since it is she whom Duterte comes home to every week. ,Sources say Avance\u00f1a\u2019s urging has led to certain appointments in government, including the appointment of an ambassador.,Title or no title, she already gets to hobnob with heads of state and their influential spouses. ,Five more years remain in the Duterte presidency. With Honeylet\u2019s transformation in this first year alone, who knows what heights she\u2019ll reach in the days to come? ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/174279-evolution-honeylet-avancena-first-lady", "title": "The evolution of Duterte\u2019s First Lady: Honeylet Avance\u00f1a", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174441-fyre-festival-organizer-arrested-wire-fraud,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/174393-obama-visits-childhood-home-jakarta"},

Through the Karaw Craftventures, the prisoners acquired a set of technical skills that they can use to earn a living once they get out of prison.,The Karaw Craftventures of Orpiada is one example of many other social enterprises that build their business models and strategies around corporate social responsibility (CSR), in order to effectively achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through baby steps.,The main goal of the 2030 agenda is to basically ,alleviate poverty, fight injustice, and control climate change in 14 years,, among other socil issues. Social entrepreneurs like Orpiada try to fight this from the bottom up.,Supporting social enterprises,  ,Orpiada is one of the social enterprises supported by the BPI Foundation, which has been reaching out to various communities for 37 years.,\u201cWe\u2019re really looking for social enterprises. They\u2019re not your regular capitalist enterprise that will make a good product but they really innovate in a way that they help people get out of poverty. They really bring a lot of people with them when they succeed,\u201d said BPI Foundation Communication and Project Officer Ebony Lautner.,She added that the foundation tries to build an ecosystem for inclusive growth, and the Karaw Craftventures is an example of a social enterprise that invests in the growth of a particular community.  ,\u201cThese are the types of enterprises we really love to support because they\u2019re so smart and creative and the way they look at their business model, they make sure that a part and parcel of it is a community of people,\u201d Lautner said.,Going beyond CSR ,Several national and multi-national companies in the Philippines have been practicing CSR through their respective foundations for decades. The League of Corporate Foundations alone has 80 members from different foundations and organizations who practice CSR and vow to help achieve the SDGs through it. (READ: ,P2.6 billion spent on CSR programs in 2015-LCF,),But more than practicing philanthropy and good will, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Ola Almgren said that businesses must incorporate CSR to their business strategies in order to effectively achieve the 17 SDGs.,\u201cI believe that corporations today need to go beyond corporate social responsibility to support the sustainable development goals. That means really to work them into their core business strategies,\u201d he told Rappler.,According to Almgren, taking this step will not only sustain the environment and people from different marginalized sectors, but will also sustain the corporations themselves.,\u201cFor the business sector, there\u2019s never been a more critical time to change the way we do business, including corporate social responsibility and integrating the sustainable development goals in your core business strategies.\",\u201cWhile CSR is not just good will, now is the time to move beyond good will and advocacy and show leadership, innovation, and share resources,\u201d Almgren stressed in his speech on the second day of the LCF anniversary expo on Friday, July 15, at the Makati Shangri-la Hotel.,Sharing of resources,According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), one in four Filipinos live in poverty. One out of 10 live in consistent poverty, which means not having enough resources to sustain themselves for a day. Moreover, thousands of Filipino families still don\u2019t have access to clean energy.,\u201cOne out of ten Filipinos do not have electricity in their homes. That is a huge opportunity for innovation, and for investment. The corporate sector really has a contribution to make,\u201d Almgren said.,The UNDP resident representative believes that the success of the 2030 agenda lies in a strong partnership between the government and the corporate sector. But having not enough resources from the government especially in third world countries, gives opportunity for corporations to invest and contribute more.,\u201cThe corporate sector has a greater resource to manage than the national government.\u201d,According to Almgren, corporations must take personal and corporate responsibility on how they do business. Both huge companies and humble social enterprises have a role to play in achieving the 2030 Agenda as they partner with the United Nations and the government.,\u201cI believe that there are many, many opportunities for us to work closely together. But above all, we need your contribution to the achieve agenda 2030 of the sustainable development goals,\u201d Almgren urged businessmen. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/140141-social-enterprises-means-achieve-sdgs", "title": "UN PH chief: 'Social enterprises means to achieving SDGs'", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/137291-media-coverage-mmshakedrill-success-mmda,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/business/3201-getting-call-center-agents-in-better-shape,http://www.rappler.com/sports/specials/palarong-pambansa/129953-young-water-vendors-earn-living-palaro-2016-albay,http://www.rappler.com/business/features/101486-executive-edge-karaw-craftventures-paul-orpiada,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/global-goals/106989-united-nations-commit-global-goals"},

Their families were longtime allies until they split in 2015.    ,PROBING THE GOVERNOR. Ilocos Norte Representative Rodolfo Farinas leads a probe into alleged tobacco funds misuse in his own province. Rappler photo  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Ilocos Norte\u2019s share of the tobacco excise tax was used to fund the pet projects of Governor Imee Marcos for at least two years, documents show.,Rappler obtained a copy of a Provincial Appropriation Ordinance No. 022-2011 where the Office of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan approved \u201cto set aside\u201d P57.5 million from the province\u2019s share of the tobacco excise tax for the Programang Ikauunlad ng Mamamayan Ekonomiya at Ekolohiya or what local officials call \u201cP Imee.\u201d,\"P Imee,\u201d pronounced like the name of the governor, refers to \u201cprojects programs and activities to be implemented by the governor,\u201d explained Vice Governor Eugenio Angelo Barba, who is also a cousin of the governor. ,It's not clear what entity \"P Imee\" is. Barba said \"it's just a name... written in the ordinance,\" prompting allegations that it is a lumpsum discretionary fund for the governor.,The document Rappler obtained is also reflected in an online copy of the 2011 Annual State of Local Governance. The fund transfer was recommended by Barba himself on March 7, 2011, in his capacity as presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. Marcos approved the ordinance on March 10, 2011.,A Rappler source believes this was how the provincial government funded the allegedly questionable purchase of supposedly second-hand, overpriced, and unregistered motor vehicles.,They are now the subject of an investigation by the House committee on good government and public accountability. (READ: ,House panel wants Imee Marcos to explain P66.45M in 'misused' tobacco funds),Screenshot of Ilocos Norte's 2011 Annual State of Local Governance Report ,P213 million for 'P Imee'?,Leading the probe of the eldest daughter of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos is Ilocos Norte Representative Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as, who leads the other political clan that has ruled the tobacco-growing province for decades. The two families were allies until 2015. And Marcos is on her last term as governor.,The probe suffered delays because the documents relating to the purchase of the motor vehicles have been declared missing and the local government officials involved have yet to appear before the House committee. (READ: ,House cites for contempt 7 Ilocos Norte Capitol officials,),But Fari\u00f1as has copies of the missing documents and it's obvious he knows the transactions by heart.,At the continuation of the House probe on Tuesday, May 16, he read out two other appropriation ordinances separately issued in 2013 showing the transfer of more tobacco funds to \u201cP Imee.\",The first ordinance signed in July 2013 involved P78.6 million. The other ordinance signed in September 2013 involved another P78 million. These two documents have not been released publicly, however, and could not be independently verified by Rappler. ,Barba, who attended the House probe, noted that the documents shown to him were only a \"machine copy.\" He asked for time to review their records before commenting on the funds trasfer. ,If all 3 ordinances prove genuine, this means that at least P213 million were transferred from the tobacco excise tax fund to \"P Imee\" in 2011 and 2013 alone.,Barba maintained the money allocated for \"P Imee\" was not a lumpsump for Marcos. He claimed it still needed accompanying resolutions before it could be spent. ,Fari\u00f1as: What is P. Imee?,Barba: To the best of my knowledge it's for projects, programs, and activities to be implemented by the governor. ,Farinas: It's a lumpsum for the governor?,Barba: It's for various projects, your honor.,Fari\u00f1as: How was it created?,Barba: It's just a name, your honor. 'Yun lang ang tawag po.,Farinas: Oo nga. Parang DAP. ,Barba: It was just written in the ordinance, if my memory serves me right. ,Barba was also asked to submit to the House committee documents to show how the province's share of the excise tax funds were appropriated. ,Marcos vs Fari\u00f1as,Fari\u00f1as accuses Marcos of violating Republic Act 7171 \u2013 An Act to Promote The Development of the Farmer in the Virginia Tobacco Producing Provinces \u2013 for diverting tobacco funds from its intended uses. ,\",Ang uses ng, shares [from the tobacco excise tax] ,ng, Republic Act 7171 are specific. ,Hindi po kasama ang, motor vehicles (Republic Act 7171 is specific about the uses of the shares from the tobacco excise tax. They can't use it to purchase motor vehicles),\" Fari\u00f1as said. ,But Marcos could face worse charges as the House probe digs deep into 3 transactions \u2013 totalling P66.4 million \u2013 to buy the motor vehicles, and several cash advances made by Capitol officials including one that amounted to P32 million. ,Fari\u00f1as said Marcos' signatures were all over the transactions.

{"author": "Pia Ranada", "date": "2017-06-28T13:00:00+0800", "content": "\nThe first year of the Duterte administration has Cabinet secretaries putting out fires and racing to keep up with the unpredictable president    ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 On the first Monday of every month, a few hours after lunch, Malaca\u00f1ang\u2019s Aguinaldo State Dining Room begins to fill up with the country\u2019s highest-ranking officials.,Over 30 Cabinet secretaries, heads of government agencies, take their places along a heavy wood dining table. Around the table, the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) wait with documents in hand. Undersecretaries and assistant secretaries wait outside or discuss last-minute concerns with their bosses. , ,But all activity and chit-chat stops when President Rodrigo Duterte walks in, followed closely behind by Special Assistant to the President Bong Go. Duterte walks around the room, shaking each secretary\u2019s hand, making small talk before moving on to the next official.,After a while, the assigned secretary begins the meeting with an opening prayer. The room\u2019s occupants buckle themselves down to discussions for another long evening.,This is how Cabinet meetings under the Duterte administration typically start. In his first year, the country\u2019s 16th president has presided over 16 such meetings, which translates to 1.3 meetings a month.,This number does not include his, first meeting, with his Cabinet appointees back in Davao\u2019s \u201cMalaca\u00f1ang of the South\u201d a month before his oath-taking in May 2016. , ,Late that night, media gathered under a white tent outside the Presidential Guesthouse as Duterte\u2019s appointees were introduced one by one. For many reporters, it was the first time they laid eyes on the soon-to-be officials, several plucked from anonymity to lead national agencies.,The appointees, some obviously fighting sleep, listened silently to Duterte as they sat on cream monobloc chairs, little expecting what the next 12 months would bring.,Groups in the Cabinet,Duterte has called on a variety of personalities to form his Cabinet, ranging from the foreign-educated economics professor Ernesto Pernia to militant activist Rafael \u201cKa Paeng\u201d Mariano. ,There are the ex-generals, like National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, and new Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu. ,There are the neoliberal economists, like Sonny Dominguez and Ramon Lopez, and the Leftists like Judy Taguiwalo and Leoncio Evasco Jr., ,He\u2019s mixed up officials who are no strangers to leading national government agencies (Ben Diokno, Jess Dureza, Leonor Briones, Dominguez) with those new to the role (Evasco, Mariano, Gina Lopez).,Some Cabinet officials can be grouped according to their connections to Duterte. The \u201cDavao group\u201d is composed of longtime friends and associates from his hometown. Duterte\u2019s San Beda school mates are also well-represented., ,These groups, some looser than others, overlap. Dominguez gets his influence mainly from his long friendship with Duterte (they started out as neighbors and high school mates) but also from his background in business and economics, issues that are Duterte\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. ,Evasco, Duterte\u2019s longtime trusted adviser and former chief of staff, is an ex-communist rebel yet so far does not associate himself with the other Cabinet Leftists when they vocalize their views about issues like the Marcos burial and peace talks.,Among Cabinet officials, 3 work closest with the President on a day-to-day basis: Special Assistant Go, Cabinet Secretary Evasco, and Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea.,Evasco\u2019s spokesman, Assistant Secretary Jonas Soriano, explains their different roles this way: \u201cSomeone has to make sure the President eats, sleeps, goes to meetings on time. I think that\u2019s the role of Secretary Bong Go. Someone has to make sure all the laws, procedures, EOs (executive orders) are followed, and that\u2019s Secretary Medialdea. Someone has to make sure that the agenda is okay, that this can be discussed in Cabinet meetings. That\u2019s Secretary Jun Evasco.\u201d,All 3 enjoy strong ties to Duterte. Go and Evasco were once executive aides during his mayorship. Medialdea is a childhood friend whose father, former Associate Justice Leo Medialdea, also worked with Duterte\u2019s father Vicente when the latter was Davao governor., ,Duterte has gone to lengths to expand the powers of Go and Evasco. In fact, he used his ,very first executive order ,to do just that., ,For Go, he created the first ever \u201cSpecial Assistant to the President\u201d position and the Office of the President - Events Management Cluster.,This office allows Go to supervise the PMS, Presidential Security Group, Office of the Chief of Presidential Protocol, Media Accreditation and Relations Office, and Radio TV Malaca\u00f1ang (RTVM).,Evasco, whom Duterte has publicly praised for his good organizing skills and understanding of his priorities as President, was given, supervisory powers over 12 anti-poverty agencies,.,No Little President?,Soriano and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo insist there is no \u201cLittle President.\u201d,Both admit, however, that, of the 3 Palace secretaries, Go has the most access to Duterte. The President hardly attends events without Go by his side. Go has the other distinction of being the only way to contact Duterte, who supposedly has no cellular phone of his own.,As Panelo puts it, Go \u201canticipates what the President needs.\u201d,\u201cWith Bong, it\u2019s more of, [Duterte] needs him. Because he knows his style, he knows who he wants to talk to,\u201d said Panelo.,GATEWAY TO DUTERTE. Special Assistant to the President Bong Go helps President Duterte during his phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Presidential photo ,Duterte depends on Go for even the smallest of things, from remembering dates of a particular event to calling up security officials to end a ceasefire., Duterte, to a crowd of overseas Filipino workers, once introduced Go as his \u201c,tagabugaw\u201d, (pimp) because it's Go who decides who he meets everyday.,\u201cThat\u2019s why he needs to be beside him all the time. What\u2019s good with Bong, he has a photographic memory. He remembers incidents, events, places, people. So when the President asks, ',Sino na nga 'yun, anong taon 'yun?', (Who was that person? What year was that?), he answers,\u201d said Panelo.,Go hardly speaks up during Cabinet meetings and doesn\u2019t give policy recommendations. The only times he would interject is to correct the President on a particular detail or to tell him an important person is on the line.,Opportunity to convince Duterte,Cabinet meetings are Duterte\u2019s primary means of governance. It\u2019s a time when he can coordinate with Cabinet members, get a handle on different issues hounding his administration, and announce policy decisions.,During these meetings, which only recently were trimmed down to 4 to 5 hours, Duterte would first listen to presentations by Cabinet officials before giving comments.,Depending on his knowledge of the topic, Duterte could give lengthy reactions. He might interject in the middle of a presentation, often to point out bottlenecks he expects the plan to face based on his experience as a local executive.,While his predecessor Benigno Aquino III preferred to drop by cluster meetings and call fewer full Cabinet meetings, Duterte is the opposite. He likes to call full Cabinet meetings but rarely attends Cabinet cluster meetings.,Cabinet meetings are important in another aspect: they are one opportunity for Cabinet officials to convince Duterte to take a particular course of action or change his mind about an important policy.,Thus, these meetings are also a time when the different groups within the Cabinet go head-to-head.,Officials who have been present in Cabinet meetings recall 4 main issues over which debates between Cabinet members or between Duterte and Cabinet members raged.,For the mining issue, the main characters were Environment Secretary Gina Lopez and Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez. The passionate green advocate clashed with the Duterte childhood friend and campaign financier in at least two Cabinet meetings, according to Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo., ,Dominguez, who had the mining industry\u2019s interests at heart, wanted \u201cdue process\u201d in the Department of Environment and Natural Resources\u2019 implementation of its mining audit and suspension. Lopez insisted her agency observed due process but had to act more decisively given findings of the audit.,The debate never got out of hand and always ended on a positive note, said Panelo.,\u201cThey would laugh it off after. Secretary Gina would say, \u2018,Sige na, Secretary, love naman kita eh, (Come on, Secretary, you know I love you),\u2019\u201d he added.,But the ultimate resolution of the issue would be to Lopez\u2019s disadvantage. The unyielding advocate would be nixed by the Commission on Appointments, many of whose members have mining interests or connections, with little or no intervention from Duterte.,As for the SSS issue, Duterte\u2019s economic managers, led by Budget Secretary Ben Diokno and Dominguez, sought to convince the President that approving a P2,000 pension hike would endanger the agency\u2019s funds in the longterm. ,But the President, backed by some Left-leaning Cabinet secretaries, insisted on it.,In one Cabinet meeting, faced by his economic advisers\u2019 arguments, a stubborn Duterte supposedly said, \u201c,Ang problema, pangako ko 'yan.,\u201d (The problem is, I made a promise.),The deal was sealed when a Cabinet member spoke up about a spouse who asks every day when the P2,000 pension hike would come.,\u201cWhat will I tell [my spouse], Mr President?\u201d asked the Cabinet secretary.,It was then that Duterte insisted on a compromise: ,approve a P1,000 pension hike, first, then approve the next P1,000 if the tax reform package is passed by Congress.,In the issue of ratifying the Paris climate change deal, Duterte was up against a ,majority of Cabinet officials, who united, despite outward differences, to persuade him it had to be approved.,Duterte was publicly outraged by the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the international agreement since it asks even poor developing countries like the Philippines to cut down on carbon emissions when more prosperous industrialized countries were to blame for global warming.,But, in the end, as he admitted in public, he budged in the face of a \"near unanimous\" vote by Cabinet officials for the ratification of the deal. It was one instance when the neoliberals and Leftists, as well as radical Gina Lopez, took the same stand.,COLORFUL CABINET. President Duterte sits between Leftist Cabinet members, Cabinet Secretary Jun Evasco and NAPC chairperson Liza Maza during a NAPC meeting in the Palace. Presidential photo ,Duterte was also, in a way, outvoted in the matter of rice importation. His economic managers, convinced him ,during a Cabinet meeting that rice importation is necessary since the country\u2019s own rice production is insufficient to provide the required rice buffer stock.,For political analyst Tony La Vi\u00f1a, Duterte changing his mind about this issue shows he, has \"good listening and decision-making skills.\",A long leash,While Duterte is known for his strong-arm tactics against critics and naysayers, he is considerably more understanding to his Cabinet appointees., ,There are cases when a Cabinet secretary would refute or contradict him in public, yet was spared from any trash talk from the President.,Other presidents, like Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, might not have been as forgiving.,\"Duterte, gives as much leeway as possible, ,the leash is long,\" said Aries Arugay, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines-Diliman.,Cabinet officials who have so far been able to do this are Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia.,Lorenzana has told soldiers ,not to be \u201ctoo optimistic\u201d, about a salary hike despite Duterte\u2019s repeated promises that he would get this done. ,Pernia, when asked about Duterte\u2019s decision to reject European Union aid that came with strings attached, quickly said he was not consulted on it and the decision should not be taken as policy.,\u201cIt means that he doesn\u2019t micromanage his Cabinet. His Cabinet are not total minions. Power still flows from the President, but there is certain room or space for maneuver given to Cabinet members,\u201d said Arugay.,ECONOMIC EXPERTS. President Duterte's economic advisers, secretaries Sonny Dominguez, Ernest Pernia, and Mark Villar promote 'Dutertenomics.' Malaca\u00f1ang photo ,Lorenzana is also supposedly among the major voices who convinced Duterte to allow US-Philippines military exercises, albeit with some changes so as not to anger China. ,The exercises are no longer held in the West Philippine Sea and are focused on humanitarian aid and disaster response, not countering an invader.,But Duterte does draw the line somewhere. In the case of ,former Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno,, Duterte said he was convinced Sueno was \u201clying through his teeth\u201d when he said he had not yet read a DILG legal opinion on the Austrian fire trucks deal.,If this was indeed the President\u2019s reason for firing Sueno, then the decision to part ways was instinctive, based on gut feel, with little or no opportunity for Sueno to respond.,\u201cFor Duterte, there\u2019s no due process here. Once in his judgement he has lost trust in you, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Arugay., ,One other major Cabinet shake-up was Vice President Leni Robredo\u2019s ,resignation as housing czar,.  While Duterte did not fire her as he did Sueno, some observers argue he left Robredo no choice when he said he ,didn\u2019t want her attending Cabinet meetings,., ,\u201cHe can be very sensitive about people\u2019s loyalties, especially of people he doesn\u2019t know. If it was Evasco, Dominguez, Bello, or Dureza, I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve reacted that way,\u201d said Arugay.,But Arugay thinks Duterte was only testing Robredo and did not really want her out of his Cabinet.,\u201cHe is fond of testing. He will say the most controversial thing and he will look at how people react, then he will adjust, \u2018Ah, I\u2019ve figured this guy out,\u2019\u201d said Arugay., ,It was eventually Robredo herself who sealed her fate by tendering her resignation. , ,There are still several uncertainties facing Duterte\u2019s Cabinet after the one-year mark. Three of his Leftist Cabinet members \u2013 Taguiwalo, Ubial, and Mariano \u2013 have not yet been confirmed by the Commission on Appointments.,It\u2019s not certain if he will appoint a new housing czar to replace Robredo or is content to keep Evasco in charge of it.,If all goes according to Duterte\u2019s plan, Armed Forces chief General Eduardo A\u00f1o will take his oath as new Interior Secretary when he retires from the military in October.,Putting out fires,To say it\u2019s been tricky to be Duterte\u2019s Cabinet appointee is an understatement, given the many fires they've had to put out.,Duterte has a nerve-wracking tendency to make big policy announcements without so much as a heads-up to secretaries who will be most affected by his words., ,\u201cIn that sense, there is no coordination between him and the secretaries. The working relationship is, it\u2019s like they have to do damage control when the President says something that has an implication on their specific portfolio,\u201d said Ela Atienza, chairperson of the University of the Philippines\u2019 political science department.,Take the time he announced the Philippines\u2019 military and economic ,\u201cseparation\u201d from the United States, during a business forum in Beijing during his October state visit.,Security officials seemed as unprepared for Duterte\u2019s statement as the media. Lorenzana refused to comment when approached by reporters. National Security Adviser Esperon spoke as if he had nothing to do with the policy announcement., , \"I don't need to advice anything because that's already a decision made,\u201d he had said as he headed straight for the venue\u2019s exit.,A few hours after, two of his economic advisers, Dominguez and Pernia, issued a joint statement to cool things down. They insisted that despite Duterte\u2019s declared split, the country \u201cwill maintain relations with the West\u201d  but desires \u201cstronger integration with our neighbors.\u201d,Then there was the time during Duterte\u2019s Hanoi visit when he announced an ,end to war exercises, with the US. A nonplussed Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr could only stammer repeated no\u2019s to media as he insisted, that was not what Duterte said,., ,As much as an assurance to himself as to the media, Yasay reiterated official statements that the Duterte administration would continue to respect commitments with the US.,In March, Duterte displayed ,alarming confusion, about Benham Rise during a Malaca\u00f1ang press conference. He appeared to have thought it was located within the disputed West Philippine Sea, leading him to make worrisome statements about China\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d over territory unequivocally bestowed to the Philippines.,Days after, security officials had to, sit him down in a briefing ,about Benham Rise to explain it is located on the eastern side of the country and thus not involved in the maritime dispute with China.,In succeeding speeches, Duterte would showcase his new knowledge about Benham Rise and champion efforts to rename it Philippine Rise.,Duterte\u2019s first year in power has proven a challenge to his Cabinet appointees, who not only have had to adjust to their national positions but also to the unpredictable and fiery leadership style of their President. \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/173992-duterte-presidency-first-year-cabinet", "title": "Keeping up with Duterte: A year inside the Cabinet", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/174350-money-mind-pacquiao-faces-former-teacher,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/174203-knicks-top-executive-phil-jackson-agree-part-ways,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/170072-imee-marcos-tobacco-excise-tax-misuse,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective"},

And he did.    ,HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM. Yco Tan with wife Elizabeth. Photo courtesy of Yco Tan   ,Yco Tan can still remember it clearly: the day he decided that he deserved a better life.,He was only 17. The eldest boy in a Filipino-Chinese family, he had been his family\u2019s breadwinner for as long as he could remember. ,Yco was walking through a flooded market that day carrying a basketful of tomatoes. He had been doing the same thing almost every day for the last 10 years, but his heart seemed to carry the weight of the rainclouds that particular day.,The Tan family got by on the meager income from their stall in the local market where they sold tomatoes and onions. Every morning, Yco manned the stall then went to school at 5 pm. After school at 10 pm, he would go to Divisoria to find anything else he could sell.,He wouldn\u2019t call himself business-minded then. \"Business-,pilit, (forced)\" would have been more apt, he said.,On that fateful rainy day, the 17-year-old Yco trudged towards the delivery truck with his basket. He waded through floating trash and rotten vegetables, and just before he reached the end of the road, he saw two rats swimming beside him, as if they were racing him to dry ground.,\u201cIs this really all my life can be?\u201d he recalled asking himself. \u201cThere must be a better plan for me,\u201d he said, while crying.,The rough way up,From that point on, Yco was willing to jump at any chance to get a better lease on life.,That opportunity came when a friend invited him to apply at an agency looking for Filipinos who want to work in Saudi Arabia. ,Since Yco was only 19 years old at the time, they had to rig his application to make it appear that he was 21, the minimum age requirement for applicants. It was a common practice among OFWs back in the day, he shared., ,Luck was in his favor, as Yco\u2019s application passed. His friend, however, didn\u2019t make the cut.,In 1984, 19-year-old Yco, along with 35 other Filipinos, flew to Saudi Arabia to work. , ,Yco Tan with his co-workers in Sarawat Superstore, Jeddah, KSA. Photo courtesy of Yco Tan ,Yco started working as a warehouse man for a department store, earning SR850 every month \u2013 barely equivalent to P5,000 at the time \u2013 a high salary for someone his age back in Manila. Young as he was, however, Yco had big dreams and \u201cclamping cans\u201d in a warehouse wasn\u2019t going to be his life. , ,The young Yco had his eyes set for a promotion, even though he knew he didn't have a strong chance, since the company rarely gave managerial positions to Filipinos. \u201cThe biggest challenge is still discrimination. At work, everybody knows that it\u2019s the Filipinos who do most of the job. But when it comes to promotions, the last people they\u2019d consider are Filipinos,\u201d he said., ,This reality didn\u2019t stop him from chasing his dream. When his supervisors noticed his dedication, Yco was promoted to work on the shop floor in just two years.,MANAGER. Because of his dedication, Yco Tan was given a managerial position just a few years after he started working. Photo courtesy of Yco Tan   ,His dream didn\u2019t stop there, either. He eventually worked his way to becoming junior manager, and then an assistant manager.,Yco couldn\u2019t get a higher promotion than that since the position of store manager required a college degree. After he insisted on it, Yco\u2019s company offered to send him to school in exchange for years of service in the company. Yco took the offer and went to study marketing and management at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. After 3 years of studies, he went back to Saudi, finally as a store manager \u2013 a feat that no other Filipino in their company had ever achieved.,As manager, Yco led a staff of 175 people from 16 different countries. Having to work his way from the bottom up worked to his advantage: Yco knew the company better than anyone. Overall, he'd stayed with his employer for 18 years.,With his remittances, he sent his siblings to college. One became an engineer, another an accountant, and the youngest, a physical therapist.,\",Kung hindi ako umalis, siguro kahit isa sa amin ay hindi makakapag-college, (If I didn't leave, perhaps none of us would have been able to get a college degree),\" he said.,While in Saudi, Yco met his wife, Elizabeth, a nurse at a private clinic in Jeddah. They have 3 kids: Joshua, Eryka, and Matthew., ,Homecoming,Having to fly from one branch to another eventually took a toll on Yco\u2019s health. He was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. In  2002, he decided to return to the Philippines. ,Yco, who had met success in Saudi, suddenly had to start from scratch again and build a new career in the Philippines.,He and his wife first tried their luck with a sewing business, manufacturing uniforms for the Philippine National Police (PNP). It didn\u2019t work out well because of late payments. ,In the early 2000s, beauty parlors were popping out fast all over the country and Yco partnered with his sister-in-law to start one. Their relationship turned sour and the Tans decided to open one in Bicol themselves., ,Yco had always thought big. He wanted his salon to be nothing less than great \u2013 a business mentality that, he said, is rare in the provinces. He needed a sizeable capital for the venture so Yco applied for a livelihood loan from LandBank. He got a P300,000-loan. ,The Tans opened their first salon, EveGate, in Tabaco City, Albay, which quickly became a hit among Albay\u2019s middle class. They paid their loan immediately and opened other branches in the region.,Yco soon ventured into other businesses, all in the beauty and wellness industry and under the banner of the Tanvera Corporation. They opened Salon de Estudyante, a hair salon for the masses; Fresh Up Nail and Body Spa; and Spalon, a high-end salon and spa. ,As of writing, the Tans have a total of 16 salons, spread all over the Bicol region. Their 17th branch is set to open this year.,They branched into the distribution business through Adams Housing Salon Supply which distributes salon supplies, formula, and equipment in Albay; and also the Evegate Technical Development Training Academy, a TESDA-accredited school for aspiring beauty and hair technicians.,Team effort,TAN FAMILY. Yco Tan with wife Elizabeth and their 3 children receive an award. ,Yco said his secret to success is the cooperation of his whole family in running the business. \u201cIt\u2019s a team effort,\u201d he said.,Because of his experience, Yco is in charge of the overall management of their business while Elizabeth takes care of training their employees. Son Joshua handles human resource and marketing.,Government agencies have recognized the family's efforts. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) Region V honored Yco and his family with the Model OFW Family of the Year Award for 2012, while the Department of Labor and Employment gave their company the ,Outstanding Achievement in Entrepreneurship Award.,They also received the 2012 Outstanding Non-Agri-based Entrepreneur Award and the Gawad Entrepreneur Bagong Bayani Award from the ,LandBank of the Philippines.,Giving back,The Tans\u2019 success goes beyond awards. ,With their businesses, they are able to give at least 250 people regular income, including  persons with disabilities (PWDs). ,Yco said the decision to hire PWDs was influenced by their house help who was a deaf mute.,\"So everytime na nagtetraining si misis, nakikita namin siya na parang very attentive. Interesado siya. And when my wife asked her kung gusto niyang matuto, sabi niya very much willing daw siya,\u201d, Yco shared. After this, the Tans made sure to hire at least one PWD for every salon and give PWDs scholarship to their school., ,(Because once, I had a helper who was deaf and mute. And everytime my wife was training, we saw that she was very attentive. She was interested. And when my asked her if she wanted to learn, she said yes.),In partnership with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the Tans also give free massage and physical therapy training to different communities in Bicol, automatically hiring the top 5 students of their classes. ,Their salons are also required to organize at least two outreach programs every year. They usually go to remote communities to provide free haircuts, manicure, pedicure, and massages., ,The Tans have also hired capable senior citizens in their salons who are tasked to provide \"motherly care\u201d to their staff. Working in a beauty salon, Yco said, can be an empowering experience and will give the elderly a chance to be productive again and to feel good about themselves., \u201cIf we hire them, they become busy, earn money, and at the same time, become more beautiful. They get a reason and the means to dress up again and look good,\u201d he shared in Filipino. ,The former OFW is the co-chairman of the UN\u2019s Joint Migration and Development Initiative (JDMI) in Bicol, leading programs aimed to help families left behind by OFWs.,Advice to OFWs, ,Having come far from selling vegetables at the local market, Yco has a lot of wisdom to share to OFWs pining for success.,First, he said, is to plan for their homecoming and business early. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to make the same mistake I did where I only thought about doing business when I\u2019m already back,\u201d he said. ,\"Habang nasa abroad ka palang, pagaralan mo na ng mabuti. Kailangan you come home prepared. You do a project study. You do a business plan. Lumapit ka sa gobyerno kasi government has so many things na ibinibigay like free training. May mga loan pa sila,\u201d, added.  ,(While you\u2019re still abroad, study it carefully. You have to come home prepared - make a project study, business plan. Reach out to the government because they provide a lot like free training and loans.) ,This will help the OFW make calculated decisions and make sure that their hard-earned savings won\u2019t go to waste.,Yco also said that OFWs need to learn to trust the government more. \u201c,Before, galit ako sa gobyerno. Feeling ko kinukuhanan lang nila ako, (Before, I was mad at the government. I felt like they\u2019re just getting money from me). But I realized that we can actually help each other, like when I got my livelihood loan from LandBank,\u201d he shared. ,The OFW\u2019s family must also realize that each member has a role to play in the success of the family. In his case, he shared that he couldn\u2019t have been where he is now if not for his wife. ,\u201cHabang si mister ay nasa abroad, si misis sa Pilipinas ay maaaring magnegosyo na (While the husband is abroad, his wife in the Philippines can start a business),\u201d, Yco said. ,Yco also said that an OFW and his or her family must choose a business that they are really passionate about. This would help make any task seem easy. ,\u201cKung \u2018yung ginagawa mo ay \u2018yung gusto ng puso mo, napakaikli ng 24 hours sa 'yo, (If you\u2019re doing what your heart really wants, 24 hours would be too short for you),\u201d he said. ,As for Yco, he just keeps on moving forward., Just as he did when he was young, when he waded through the murky flood to reach his destination, he knows that challenges will keep on coming as he strives to reach his goals.  ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/173690-yco-tan-success-story-ofw", "title": "From vegetable vendor to Bicol's salon magnate", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/business/174294-century-properties-affordable-housing-market,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective"},

Around 600 Spaniards were reportedly killed from the said earthquake, according to various historical accounts. ,STANDING STRONG. The Manila Cathedral is rebuilt several times after being destroyed by different disasters. File photo of the Manila Cathedral. Noel Celis/AFP,Second riskiest city in the world,Home to around ,1.6 million people,, the Malaca\u00f1ang Palace, the Port of Manila and various historical sites, the City of Manila is highly vulnerable to earthquakes and other hazards.,A ,2013 study, conducted by the Swiss Re, a provider of risk transfer insurance, consider Manila as the second riskiest city in the world, next to Tokyo. This is not only because of floods but also because of its vulnerability to earthquakes.  ,Two major faultlines are located near the City of Manila. First is the West Valley Fault, which experts believe could trigger a 7.2 magnitude earthquake once it moves. Second is the fault line in Manila Trench, which may cause 7.9 magnitude earthquake.,A 2004 study conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the ,Metropolitan Manila Earthquake Impact Reduction Study (MMEIRS),, indicated that an earthquake hitting Metro Manila could destroy 40% of the buildings in the metropolis and kill about 34,000.,According to Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) director Renato Solidum, movement in the West Valley Fault will cause the most severe damage.,But even faultlines outside of the metropolis could affect the city.,A 7.3 magnitude earthquake occured in Casiguran, Aurora, with the city of Manila bearing the brunt of the tremor,The last major earthquake that severely affected Manila was in August 1968. With a 7.3 magnitude and an epicenter in Casiguran, Aurora, it caused major damages to the city, resulted in the collapse of the Ruby Tower, and killed 270 people. ,The epicenter of the earthquake that destroyed the Manila Cathedral in 1645 was at Gabaldon, Nueva Ecija.,If that fault line moves again, can it trigger the same disastrous effect in Manila as it did then?,\u201cThere have been many earthquakes generated outside Manila but still severely affected Manila. Reason would be the soft sediments foundation of Manila which would amplify shaking,\u201d Solidum told Rappler.,Are Manile\u00f1os ready?,\u201cOur study would indicate that (if a major earthquake hits Metro Manila) Manila City will have the second highest number in terms of square meters for complete damage,\u201d Solidum said. Complete damage could either mean buildings are still standing but completely ruined or they are totally leveled to the ground.,Solidum explained that the only reason for Quezon City being the first is because they have bigger land and population.,Solidum added that the city of Manila will also be second in terms of the number of casualties should a 7.2 magnitude earthquake strike.,The city is preparing for the next big one. On July 2, 2014, Manila organized a city-wide drill as part of the Office of Civil Defense\u2019s nationwide simultaneous earthquake drill.,According to city officials, 70% of the establishments all over the city participated in the drill that simulated 7.2 and 7.9 magnitude earthquakes.,Drills are critical to test not only the city\u2019s response capacity and the readiness of the residents but also existing communication lines between different government units and other groups that need to respond.,Not everyone, however, took the Manila earthquake drill seriously. Instead of listening to the local responders, many participants took selfies of themselves during the drill. ,For preparedness, the importance of having an evacuation plan, and actually knowing where evacuation centers are located, are also important, stressed by Solidum.,\u201cPeople should know what to do before, during and after the earthquake. Part of the plan should be [knowing] how you respond, how you evacuate from the building and to an open area,\u201d said Solidum.,He said that buildings should be examined first before going out and that there should be a designated evacuation center so that help can easily be given.,\u201cThe open area has to be a safer area,\u201d Solidum stressed. \u201cShaking does not kill, collapsing buildings do,\u201d Solidum explained.,Take the building code seriously,Beyond the earthquake drills, making sure that buildings and houses are safe is critical to reducing potential casualties if a major earthquake hits the city, according to Solidum.,Rappler talks to Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum about what could happen if a 7.2-magnitude earthquake hits Metro Manila,In an earlier interview, Director Solidum said that the reason why a number of buildings collapsed during the ,1968 Casiguran quake, is because of poor design and construction, as no building code existed during that time.,\u201cThere are more buildings today than in 1645,\u201d said Solidum. This could make the effects of a 7.2 magnitude earthquake today all the more damaging.,Experience during the 1990 Luzon earthquake has shown that buildings built according to standards can withstand groundshaking during earthquakes.,The Luzon quake, which happened over 2 decades ago, damaged many hotels, buildings and houses in Baguio, Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan and killed 2,412 people. But while many buildings were destroyed, Solidum pointed out that the Luzon quake also left a lot of buildings standing right next to those that collapsed. (READ: ,Remembering the 1990 Luzon Earthquake,),To a great extent, Solidum told Rappler during a briefing, the fact that many buildings withstood the 1990 Luzon quake could be attributed to the enforcement of the ,National Building Code, which was initially enacted in 1972,, years after the Ruby tower collapsed.,Here are some photos during the 1990 Luzon earthquake (All photos courtesy PHIVOLCS),\n,Unfortunately, people tend to skirt building code requirements to save on costs when building homes.,Is your house earthquake-resistant? Check yourself using these 12 questions.,Towards this end, Phivolcs and JICA earlier this year launched \",How Safe is My House? Self-check for Earthquake Safety,.\" This is a 12-point questionnaire homeowners can use to assess the earthquake readiness of their house.,In areas like Manila where many structures were built before the building code was enacted, structures like old churches will have to be evaluated to see if they can withstand earthquakes, the Phivolcs director said.  ,Solidum clarified however that not all buildings built after 1972 followed the Building Code. And even those that followed may not be updated because the law is constantly changed and improved.,\u201cIf the buildings conform to the newest standard, then that\u2019s better. It\u2019s more appropriate with new information,\u201d Solidum said. He added, however, that buildings following the early versions of the building code are still fine.,In 1977, then President Ferdinand Marcos ,revised, the existing National Building Code of the Philippines to make provisions more updated and appropriate to the changing times.,In 2013, Senator Chiz Escudero filed ,Senate Bill 430, that mandates nationwide inspection of buildings and imposition of stiff penalties to violators of the code. The bill is still pending at the Senate.,Preparedness matters,No one can really predict when an earthquake will hit the region or even the city, for that matter. But with early preparations, not only by the government, but by the public and private sector as well, its effects could be minimized, according to experts.,Over 70 participants gather for a workshop on how social media can help disaster managers gather and share information during times of crises,The need to spread this critical message is one of the reasons why Rappler put up Project Agos, its platform for disaster management and climate adaptation. ,Project Agos, is a collaborative platform that combines top-down government action with bottom-up civic engagement to help communities learn about climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.,Project Agos aims to foster a community that shares best practices and works together towards achieving the zero casualty goal during disasters. The project harnesses online, mobile phone, and crowdsourcing technologies and social media to ensure that critical information flows to those who need it before, during, and after a disaster.,On November 17, 2014, Rappler, through Project Agos, organized a ,capacity building workshop, for local disaster managers and civil society groups in Metro Manila on the use of social media, mobile phone and crowdsourcing technologies for disaster management. It is the first of a series of workshops on the subject to be held in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.,The project is supported by the Australian Government.  The Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) is also a Project Agos partner.,To learn more about Project Agos, email moveph@rappler.com. ,- Rappler.com,Manila Cathedral marker from PHIVOLCS", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/knowledge-base/76464-how-vulnerable-manila-earthquakes", "title": "How vulnerable is Manila to earthquakes?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/knowledge-base/86509-tsunami-101-need-know-tsunamis,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/99741-faith-science-lessons-1990-luzon-earthquake,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/63417-remembering-1990-luzon-earthquake,http://www.rappler.com/nation/10028-what-to-keep-in-a-disaster-kit,http://www.rappler.com/nation/41764-prepared-metro-manila-strong-quake,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/65064-casiguran-earthquake"},

Otherwise, we may not able to prioritize actions to ensure that 'no one is left behind.'\n, ,The SDGs put forward a shared vision of where we want to see the world to be in 2030, in terms of economic, social, environmental, and governance conditions, with statistics to be produced by member states in 2015 to serve as baselines for monitoring progress.,At the close of the millennium 15 years ago, 189 UN members adopted the Millennium Declaration which committed humanity to poverty reduction and related goals. The following year, the UN Secretary General\u2019s Road Map for implementing the Millennium Declaration formally defined eight goals, supported by 18 quantified and time-bound targets by 2015, and 48 statistical indicators, which subsequently became known as the MDGs.,For instance, for poverty reduction, the goal was to reduce by half the proportion of people in extreme poverty from 1990 to 2015, with one of the indicators for measuring this poverty reduction goal and this specific target as the percentage of the population with incomes less than $1 a day (in 1990 prices, or $1.25 in 2005 prices).,The number of targets and indicators for monitoring the MDGS were subsequently further expanded to 21 targets and 60 indicators (see Table 1). ,Table 1. Number of MDG Targets and Indicators per Goal,MDGs,Number of Targets,Number of Indicators,MDGs,Number of Targets,Number of Indicators,  , , , , , , , ,Source: ,UN,The MDGs set forth a framework for global aid discussions, and provided an agenda not only for the world and its member states, but also within countries. Across the world, progress has been observed in many of the MDGs, especially in reducing extreme poverty, and in improving access to education and health services.,The first of the MDGs on poverty reduction has been achieved ahead of the 2015 deadline: the proportion of people with incomes less than $1.25 a day (in 2005 prices) in 2010 (18 percent) was already half the 1990 proportion (36 percent). Despite population growth, 700 million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty in 2010 than in 1990.  Still, over a billion (1.2 billion) people are living in extreme poverty.,The UN, in its ,MDG Report 2014,, noted that aside from achieving the extreme poverty reduction target ahead of the 2015 deadline, the world has also already met its targets on access to safe drinking water and improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers. In addition, the targets on gender equality in primary and secondary education and the incidence of malaria are projected to be met by 2015, although gender disparity was noted to be still prevalent in higher levels of education. In addition, results have been observed in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis globally.  ,Hunger, child undernutrition, and child mortality also have continued to decline.  Across the world, the political participation of women has continued to rise. Primary school participation and access to improved sanitation has also risen. ,Uneven progress, ,But while much progress on the MDGs has been achieved, the rate of progress has been very uneven across regions, across countries, and across the Goals. ,Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of development challenges with continuing food insecurity, very high child and maternal mortality, a large number of people living in informal settlements, an increase in extreme poverty, and an overall shortfall in attaining a majority of the MDGs.,Latin America, the transition economies, as well as the Middle East and North Africa, have shown slow or no progress on some of the MDGs,with persistent (and even rising) inequalities  preventing progress on attaining other MDGs. Asia has yielded the fastest progress in reducing poverty and improving access to social services, and yet, even in Asia, the number of people living in extreme poverty are in the hundreds of millions of people.,Figure 1. ,Extent of progress toward achieving the MDGs, by number of countries,. ,  ,In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), many member states have either had low poverty headcount rates since the 1990s, or reduced rates of the proportion of people in extreme poverty.  ,From the mid-1990s to 2010, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia have shown dramatic improvements in welfare conditions, especially as these countries have been experiencing considerable economic growth as well as implementing a number of successful pro-poor programs. ,Indonesia, in particular, has implemented both a conditional cash transfer (CCT) and an unconditional cash transfer.,In contrast, the proportion of people in extreme poverty has been at a practical standstill in the Philippines.,Trends in the lack of changes in poverty headcounts from 2006-2012, ,whether using the country\u2019s official poverty lines, or the international poverty lines ($1.25 per person per day), have actually been quite similar. Thus achieving the first of the MDG targets on reducing extreme poverty and hunger by this year 2015 to half their levels in 1990 is close to impossible for the Philippines. ,More recent poverty data from another survey instrument for the first semesters of 2013 and 2014 suggest reportedly a rise in poverty, but actually, a more careful reading of the ,press release, of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) suggests that there was no change in the poverty rate. But because the 2014 survey did not include respondents in the province of Leyte (which was hit hardest by supertyphoon Yolanda), the national poverty rate is likely to be even higher than was estimated by the PSA.,Thus, the Philippines has yet to ensure that its recent economic growth benefits everyone.  The ,wealthiest Filipinos, whose wealth continues to rise will need to make more investments in the country that will ultimately assure sustained growth and progress.,Figure 2: ,Trends in Headcount Poverty Rates across selected ASEAN countries: 1980-2011.,  ,Unfinished agenda,In the Philippines, there is ,evidence, that some poor actually manage to exit from poverty, but for every poor who does exit poverty, there is about one non-poor who falls into poverty (likely from shocks of impacts of natural calamities, rising prices of food, loss of jobs, etc.), so the challenge is to set up social protection not only for the poor, but also for the nearly poor who can easily fall into poverty. ,Although a fast-growing country like the Philippines will very likely not achieve its MDG targets on poverty reduction, and also on malnutrition, maternal mortality, reducing HIV/AIDS, but it will achieve some MDG targets on ,primary education for all, gender equality, sanitation and infant mortality,. ,Improvements in school participation appear to have been result of the government\u2019s investments in addressing input deficits (classrooms, teachers, tables, chairs) with increases in budgets for the Department of Education (DepED), as well as in ,Pantawid Pamilya, (our CCT) appear to be paying off with far fewer children of school going age who are out of school.  With improved education attainments of children from poor families, it is expected that when these children join the labor market, incomes will likely be higher than what they would have had with less education. ,In this end year for the MDGs, while much has been achieved, there is an unfinished development agenda even for the MDG targets that have been met.,Thus discussion on the SDGs has taken shape, with the UN Open Working Group on SDGs proposing double the number of Goals tin the MDGs (17 goals). Within the 17 proposed goals (see Table 2), there would be even much more targets (169) than the MDG targets, and likely there will be at least 300 statistical indicators to monitor for the SDGs.    ,Table 2. Proposed Sustainable Development Goals,Source: ,United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform,While undoubtedly, the MDGs was limited in scope, e.g., it did not cover targets on inequality  and it was more concerned about poverty issues than a much broader framework, the current proposal on the SDGs is going overboard with too many goals that will likely undermine a clear focus for a development agenda, whether at the global, regional or country level. ,The MDGs suffered from the lack of consensus on the targets and indicators, with a mere expert group from international organizations defining all the targets and goals. In contrast, the UN conducted many \u201cglobal conversations,\u201d which included 11 thematic and 83 national consultations, and even door-to-door surveys. It also conducted an online My World survey asking people to prioritize the areas they\u2019d like to see addressed in the SDGs.,In 2013, the Open Working Group on SDG even invited official statisticians (that then included myself) to an ,informal meeting, regarding measuring progress, which opened the doors for further discussions with official statisticians.  Still, official statisticians have not managed to influence the Open Working Group into keeping things simple.  ,Setting priorities,The current proposal on the SDGs may have been spoiled by too many cooks, as it does not provide guidance to prioritize targets, but leaves it to regions and countries to to have a roadmap for prioritizing and attaining the SDGs according to context.,Past experience on MDG targeting, however, suggests that country capacities to identify targets are weak. ,For instance, the Philippines defined a target to halve poverty rates from 1990, when this was very aspirational and did not take account of historical trends that would have suggested that this is going to be an extra challenge. In Myanmar, baseline indicators on poverty were from 2005, rather than 1990, and yet the government adopted a target to reduce poverty rates in 2015 to half the baselines, when the whole world used 1990 baselines, again making this more an aspirational than a realistic target.,It can also be observed that many of the proposed SDG targets are more of political statements than measureable achievements. Beyond the goals and targets for the SDGs, statistics will need to be identified, and more importantly, there will be a need to provide funds to sustain statistics for the SDGs, whether by governments or donors.  ,Sadly, even for the 60 MDG indicators, between half to two thirds of these statistics have been produced in ASEAN member states, and likely, for countries with less development and less statistical capacity, the availability of MDG statistics is not as good as in ASEAN (see Table 3).  How then can we monitor what we do not measure, especially for countries in more need of development?,Table 3. Total MDG Indicators Produced in Selected ASEAN member nations ,Country,MDG Indicators,Total Indicators,Total produced by NSO,Total produced by others,Cambodia,32,20,12,Indonesia,48,28,20,Malaysia,33,15,18,Myanmar,49,3,46,Philippines,42,18,24,Thailand,54,6,48,Vietnam,32,19,13,Sources: National Statistics Offices (NSOs) of Select ASEAN Countries ,The UK Prime Minister ,David Cameron,, who co-chaired a ,High Level Panel,, that authored a report to discuss a post 2015 Development Agenda, has suggested trimming down the SDG targets to around ten.   ,Japan also is not happy about the current proposal. It will be important that the Philippines joins the UK and Japan in calling for a more focused development agenda. Otherwise, we may not able to prioritize actions to ensure that \u201cno one is left behind.\u201d, \u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/87791-sustainable-development-mdg-sdg", "title": "Sustainable goals: From the MDGs to the SDGs", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/22242-lookback-growing-pains-for-promising-up-crew,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/84833-poverty-inequality-data,http://www.rappler.com/business/214-who-s-who/85686-filipinos-forbes-billionaires-list-2015"},

The inmates have a right to a livelihood a basic privilege to be given good and dignified opportunities says Paul Orpiada of Karaw Craftventures. Photos from Karaw Craftventures Outside of a one time viewing of videos of Cebu s dancing inmates I can freely admit to not giving much thought to the inmate population of the Philippines.I would imagine most other Filipinos feel the same way. Between the natural disasters that befall our country and the corruption we face at every institutional level it is difficult to think of our correctional facilities and the Filipinos living in them.Social entrepreneur Paul Orpiada might have had the same view until an outreach visit during college changed him. He said he was struck by the physical emotional and psychological struggles that the inmates faced.Some rarely got a visit abandoned as they were by their families while others suffered from severe depression that often led to suicide attempts. The congested prison cells also deprive them of breathable space Orpiada said. The sum of these conditions made rehabilitation difficult to achieve.GOAL. Karaw Craftventures creates sustainable livelihood opportunities for the women inmates of Naga City District Jail through an in prison skills development program. ARTISANS. The prisoners upcycle scrap and waste materials into products such as plush toys keychains bags shirts and shoes sold under a variety of brand names The Ragpet Project Mu equeta and Aurora. Right to livelihoodPrisoners are not only neglected by society in general but also by social organizations. Orpiada said there is a lack of cause driven organizations trying to rehabilitate prisoners.Inmate rehabilitation after all may not be the sexiest of causes given that they are complicit in the crimes that landed them in prison.Yet Orpiada believes they still deserve our attention particularly as when comes to defending their human rights. They also have a right to livelihood a basic privilege to be given good and dignified opportunities for the welfare of their and their families futures he said. These people should not be left to simply idle away in confinement but be empowered toward better tomorrows. To achieve this goal Orpiada formed a school business that eventually evolved into a social enterprise known as Karaw Craftventures.According to Orpiada the goal of Karaw Craftventures is to create sustainable livelihood opportunities for the women inmates in Naga City District Jail through an in prison skills development program which would hopefully reduce recidivism habitual relapse into crime or criminal behavior and poverty upon their release. This community is treated as suppliers or production units where 36 inmate artisans craft the products during their idle time inside the jail he said. The prisoners upcycle scrap and waste materials into products such as plush toys keychains bags shirts and shoes. The end products are marketed under a variety of brand names xa0 The Ragpet Project Mu equeta and Aurora xa0 that are positioned as artisanal contemporary and of course sustainable. The interventions to this sector help the inmates maximize their time productively and earn income for their daily needs Orpiada said.Karaw Craftventures sell their products via trade fairs online marketplaces such as Beanstalk.ph Bolooka.com and Lokalista.ph and partner stores in Naga City and Metro Manila.COLLABORATION. That s why we are always on the lookout to have project collaborations with government and non government organizations Paul Orpiada says. LONG TERM. Karaw Craftventures emphasizes to the inmates that what they do for them is for their own good as well as preparation to reintegrate them into society. CHALLENGES. Bringing the inmates products to market is rewarding but also challenging says Paul Orpiada Reintegration into society Bringing the inmates products to market is rewarding but also challenging.Orpiada cited expectations as one of them. Inmates would expect a large production volume even though Karaw Craftventures is still growing. That s why we are always on the lookout to have project collaborations with government and non governmental organizations Orpiada said as he explained how the team is trying to keep the work volume more consistent.Some inmates may also see Karaw Craftventures as a pasttime rather than as a means to an end. We can t deny the fact that most of them actually think that the project that we do is just for them to utilize their idle time more than getting the full benefit of the rehabilitation program Orpiada said.As a result Orpiada said that the Karaw Craftventures emphasizes to the inmates that what they do for them is for their own good that they want to help them cope with their situation inside the jail and that they want to guide them as they reintegrate into society.Another issue is time. The Karaw Craftventures team Orpiada included has been working part time on Karaw Craftventures which limits the face to face time that they get with the prisoners.Orpiada is currently a fellow at Watson Institute Philippines the short term accelerator program founded in 2014 by youth leaders Andy Rapista Raya Buensuceso and Carbs Bayombong. He has decided that once he completes the program he will work full time on Karaw Craftventures.Orpiada s immersion into Karaw Craftventures hopefully produces more success stories as was the case with inmate Raquel. A mother of 8 she had been jailed because of multiple estafa cases. Her family would not visit her during her incarceration so she felt abandoned and alone.Raquel joined Karaw Craftventures just as it was getting started. She eventually rose to the position of community head as she designed beautiful products and showed leadership potential. When we asked her about what motivated her to perform well in the project she said that she really wanted to have a reformed life for the sake of her children especially for her newborn Orpiada said.It took two years but Raquel s dream eventually came true. Since her family got to know that Raquel performed well in her rehabilitation they finally reconciled and accepted her again he said. She got a new job and still continues to get commissioned works for Karaw Craftventures.

Coaches felt pride in every athlete\u2019s victory, and spectators enjoyed all the festivities. ,(READ: ,Palaro 2016 Mood Meter: Most participants are Happy,),But it\u2019s not only the lives of the participants that were changed. Palaro also painted a smile on the faces of two young boys who didn\u2019t mind the scorching heat as they sold water and other bottled drinks all around the complex in order to help their families.,Meet Rick and Jenly.,Palaro water boys, ,It\u2019s a Sunday afternoon and the sun decided to burn at 33 degrees in Legazpi City. The 2016 Palarong Pambansa just opened and thousands of people flocked to the Albay-BU Sports and Tourism Complex to witness the biggest annual sporting event in the country. ,Amid the crowds watching the opening ceremony and all the people walking around the complex, there were two remarkable faces you couldn\u2019t help but notice.,Jenly Letran, an 11-year-old boy, hardly squeezed himself through the thick mass of people surrounding the track oval. The boy visibly struggled carrying a green bucket, but still wore the biggest smile. ,\u201c,Ate! Mabakal ka?,\u201d he offered. (Ate! You want to buy?),The boy, who barely stood at 3 feet, turned out to be selling ice cold water and energy drinks, making the most out of the opportunity to earn money in big occasions like Palaro. ,After a while, another boy emerged from the crowd and joined Jenly. ,\u201c,Oo nga ate. Mabakal ka na,,\u201d said Rick Armenta, 12-years-old. (Go buy one, ate.) ,The two stood side by side with big smiles of anticipation while waiting for an answer.,Innocent desire to defeat poverty, ,Both are elementary students at Daraga North Central School. Jenly is the youngest of 5 siblings while Rick is the fifth in a brood of 9. Both of their fathers are construction workers whose jobs don\u2019t come on a regular basis. ,Unlike other children asked to work by their parents, these two boys have a different story to tell. ,\u201c,Ako lang po. Tinutulungan ko si mama,,\u201d Rick said when asked if anyone told him to work. (It\u2019s my initiative. I\u2019m helping my mother.) ,Jenly quietly sat across him while listening to Rick talk about his mother who works as a utility personnel. It turned out that Jenly hasn\u2019t seen his mom for a while now since she left them to be with her new family. ,\u201c,Sayang naman ang araw kung naka-tambay ka lang. Gusto kong makatulong,,\u201d Rick added. (I don\u2019t want to waste my day just slacking around. I want to help.) ,The two boys started telling stories of life\u2019s hard knocks while laughing in between, the way children are supposed to laugh \u2013 innocently and genuinely. Both shared there are times when their parents would have no money to put food on the table. This is where their desire to earn came from. ,According to them, they sell their products whenever Legazpi would stage huge occasions including fiestas. If there\u2019s none, Rick would harvest vegetables like gabi and sell them. He also carries baggages to the market.,\u201c,Okay naman po ang kita. Umaabot naman po ng P800 ang kita dito sa Palaro,,\u201d Rick said. (The sales here at Palaro are good. It sometimes reaches P800.), ,Simple joys,Life may not be that comfortable for the two but they are happy nonetheless. Simple joys would be spending the day with their families, watching television shows, and playing cards with their siblings. ,\u201c,Masaya naman po kahit mahirap ang buhay,,\u201d Rick said and Jenly agreed. (We\u2019re happy although life is tough.),Given their situation, their parents seldom buy them new things. So if Santa Claus were real and any of their wishes could be granted, Rick said he would wish for a bicycle while Jenly simply wanted a nice pair of shorts. ,But even without these material things, the two know how to see joy in the simplest of things. The playful kids laughed as they recalled ,the brawl, they witnessed during the championship game of the secondary boys football. ,\u201c,Ang saya panoorin ng soccer. Nakakatawa may nagsuntukan pa,,\u201d Jenly and Rick broke into laughter. (It\u2019s fun to watch soccer.  It\u2019s even more entertaining to watch the brawl.) ,Jenly and Rick are just two faces of the thousands of people whose lives somehow changed because of Palaro. (,Who are the #FacesOfPalaro?,),Palarong Pambansa doesn\u2019t just breed sportsmanship. It tells stories of different people from different walks of life who meet each other at one point.,The lives of these two boys are stories being told along the sidelines of athletes\u2019 wins and losses alike.

He insisted on not continuing our almost 4-year relationship because \",gusto niyang mag-enjoy sa buhay,.\" ,(He wanted to enjoy life.), At first it was hard for me to accept that because (1) he just texted me (2) I gave him all, my time, my family, his job.,But after the break-up, we still continue to see each other for sex. At times, I feel like we should stop what we are doing but other times, I feel like it,\u2019,s something great because I can still feel that he loves me even if we are not together anymore., ,One time, he even traveled from Bataan to Tarlac (where I presently work) for us to make love.,A,s of this moment, I am planning to continue this scenario between the two of us but still don,\u2019,t know until when. I still love him but I don,\u2019,t know if he feels the same., ,Morena Maven, ,--------------------,Dear Morena Maven (MM),,Thank you for your letter.,According to your account, your boyfriend (let's call him Joe) insisted on your break up because 'he wants to enjoy life.' Presumably this enjoyment will involve other women because otherwise he could be wining, dining, and smelling the roses with YOU.,You, desperate to keep the relationship afloat, then agreed to continue to see him \u2013 not for the wining, dining, and roses, but just for sex.,Joe must have thought he had died and gone to heaven because now he has the best of all worlds \u2013 freedom to fool around without being shackled to you, but free also for all the bedroom benefits you so lavishly and selflessly provide him.,And to cap it all, you interpret his guest appearances between your sheets as love!,I have to suggest that you are delusional if you truly believe that anything in his behavior can be described as indicative of love. He has thrown over a 4-year long relationship, is enjoying his freedom without you, and shows no sign of being interested in anything you have to offer except your body ,Having said all this, it is of course entirely up to you if you want to keep the relationship alive in this way, in the hope that he will eventually come to realize that he actually loves you. I would merely suggest that you have a plan B because it is almost certain you will need it. ,All the best,,Jeremy,DILEMMA. To continue, or not to continue this type of relationship?, ,Dear MM:,Thank you very much for your letter and for being so straightforward about your decisions, actions and your interpretations of his actions, thus making it a whole lot easier for us to be the same way as well.,Even more importantly, it helps you become a bit more objective about what\u2019s going on and thus make decisions based on your objectivity, no matter what you personally want for yourself.,Because it\u2019s so easy, isn\u2019t it, to fool yourself that things are what they really aren\u2019t, simply because you want it so badly?  It is even easier if your ex-BF sometimes behaves more like a current BF and not the FB he really is.,At least, that\u2019s what you are to him, a f*ck buddy.  He, however, is definitely more than that to you. If not, you wouldn\u2019t misinterpret his driving from Bataan to see you as anything more than a man traveling some distance (which he may enjoy anyway) to have sex (something else he enjoys). ,It is almost as if  ,\u201c,walang personalan, pang enjoy enjoy lang,\u201d,  (It\u2019s not because it\u2019s you that I traveled this far, it\u2019s just because I\u2019d drive this far to have sex with anyone with whom I enjoy sex, and this time, it happens to be you).,I am almost embarrassed to bang on about this because it\u2019s clear that you harbor no illusions.  However, because you love him, it is so easy to misinterpret any little thing he does as a \u201csign\u201d that he loves you. He doesn\u2019t seem to anymore, at least not to the extent that he wishes to continue the exclusive relationship you once had.,Change in any relationship is inevitable.  As with other inevitabilities, some are embraced joyously, others tolerated, a few deeply resented.,Any relationship can only be as close as the person who is less emotionally invested wants.  The person who calls the shots is the person in the relationship who wants and/or needs the relationship less. Thus, since you and your bf both still want a physical relationship with each other, you still have one.

In fact, his approach has put him squarely in contrast with how health practitioners think the problem should be approached.  ,The public health perspective is the big, missing element in the government's campaign against drugs. ,\"I would say we're about 20 to 30 years behind in our understanding of drug use,\" ,Regina Hechanova,, head of the Task Force on Drug Recovery of the Psychological Association of the Philippines (PAP), told Rappler.,She added: \"The understanding that our government leaders has, that's the understanding that other countries had in the 1970s. Maybe the attention to it has not been there, perhaps? Especially in a country like the Philippines where people are stigmatized, it's not something that people talk about.\",Hechanova, also ,a psychology professor at the Ateneo de Manila University,, says our understanding of drug use needs updating, especially in these crucial times.,Levels of drug use,Launched almost a year ago, the, Duterte administration's war on drugs, has seen 1,306,389 drug surrenderers as of June 13, based on figures from the Philippine National Police (PNP).,Many officials have referred to these surrenderers needing rehabilitation as drug dependents, although under the government's Drug Dependency Examination (DDE), a drug user is not automatically a drug dependent.,\"The problem is, when you talk about users, we're not really careful about our labels. We tend to think all users are addicts, and all addicts are criminals, when those are very different populations,\" Hechanova said.,Based on the DDE, a drug user can either be an experimenter, a social recreational user, a habitual user, a drug abuser, or a drug dependent, depending on their level of drug use.,According to the Dangerous Drugs Board,, those identified as drug abusers and drug dependents can be admitted to residential TRCs. Experimenters, a social recreational users, and habitual users can be treated in out-patient centers or community-based ones., ,World Health Organization (WHO) Representative in the Philippines Gundo Weiler said drug dependence occurs when people have developed a dependency syndrome in using psychoactive substances \u2013 ,substances that affect mental processes,.,Weiler said a range of substances, when used, can modify behaviors \"so that people continue to use the substance even though there are negative consequences of that substance use.\",So while at first, a drug user might feel they can still control themselves when they use a substance, Weiler said that, over time, the urge to use it \"would be bigger than the ability to actually control the use.\",A drug dependent has developed tolerance if he or she has to consume more of the substance to achieve the same effect. Withdrawal, meanwhile, happens after the substance has been cleared from the body and the drug user experiences craving \u2013 a strong urge to consume again \u2013 or other symptoms, such as trembling and sweating. ,\"So, really, dependence is a complex issue. It develops over time in some people who consume substances and, as an effect, a person who's got a dependency syndrome is really losing some of their own control over their own use,\" Weiler told Rappler.,Drug addiction,Fareda Fatima Flores of the Philippine Psychiatric Association (PPA) said drug dependence is the medical term for drug addiction, which is \"more of a layman's term.\",The newest edition of the ,Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, uses another term: substance use disorder.,In talking about drug addiction, Flores discussed the dynamics of two parts of the brain: the limbic system, \"where emotions and pleasure reside,\" and the prefrontal cortex, which is \"for logic and decision-making.\",\"Experts before say the problem of drug addiction has to do with limbic system, because this is where pleasure is evoked, but lately, addiction experts say it's not only the limbic system, but the prefrontal cortex,,\", Flores told Rappler.,Drug addiction is a disease because, according to Flores, the prefrontal cortex has a problem, and it can't control the limbic system.,\"That's why the addicts, instead of\u2026 What are our basic needs? Food, shelter, clothing, family. When you're already into addiction, all those don't matter, and drugs will be number one. That\u2019s why in recovery, you have to remove all pleasures associated to drugs, you have to remove it for the mean time because you're training your prefrontal cortex again to be in control,\" she said.,In addition, Flores said the limbic system develops earlier than the prefrontal cortex. While one's limbic system is already developed at the age of 14 to 16, the prefrontal cortex won't be developed until the age of 25.,\"So once a young person starts using drugs, they really have a hard time because they already tasted it, but the prefrontal cortex can't control yet when it comes to decision-making and logic. That\u2019s why young people should never be involved with drugs,\" she added.,REHAB CENTER. In this file photo, President Rodrigo Duterte speaks during the groundbreaking of the site of a proposed drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation center in Bukidnon. File photo from Malaca\u00f1ang  ,Continuous treatment,WHO's Weiler said that, while drug dependence is a \"chronic relapsing condition,\" it is also a treatable one. He admitted, though, that treatment for drug dependents is \"tricky\" because \"relapse in drug use is part of the condition.\",\"It's a chronic condition that the feature is, because of the strong urge to use substances, that the vast majority of people will take many different efforts to quit drug use, will relapse, and will then need treatment again, so people are coming in and out of treatment,\" he explained.,But Weiler noted that drug dependents going through treatment once and being abstinent for the rest of their lives is the \"exemption rather than the rule.\",\"The rule is that people will go on a treatment and there will be some abstinence or reduced use, people will relapse, people will re-engage with treatment, and will have many episodes of treatment over life,\" he explained.,\"It's not a one-off intervention, like a surgery that we can apply to people and then they will be cured. It's more comparable to chronic treatment that we need to apply...just like people [with] hypertension who will need chronic attention from the medical system over many years, or people with diabetes.\",Weiler said relapse is not a desired result, but supporting and engaging a drug dependent who is going through treatment is helpful \"so that, over time, rate of relapses will be reduced or the time of abstinence will be prolonged, or the severity of the relapse would be less-pronounced.\",Catching up,Hechanova's team develops evidence-based interventions for drug users going through community-based rehabilitation. She says implementors of rehabilitation programs should take a holistic approach, and take into consideration 4 perspectives in drug use: biological or chemical, environmental, existential, and psychological.,She said \"you don't really treat the person\" when you only look at the problem from a biological or chemical perspective.,\"For example, okay, given that you incarcerate them and you put them in jail, and effectively that detoxes them because you left the chemicals, but even if you let them go back out \u2013 and this is true also for people who are brought to hospitals for detox \u2013 if there's no other intervention except for the chemical intervention, people still don't understand why they use in the first place. More importantly, they don't know how to stop or to help themselves,\" she added.,  ,Only with a holistic approach, Hechanova said, can the Philippines catch up in addressing the country's drug problem.,Flores and Hechanova agreed the country is behind in terms of research on drug addiction as a health problem.,\"Actually, people are very much aware now about addiction. Maybe we need to be more scientific about it \u2013 studies and all. We lack the literature, that's why we're having a hard time coming up with a program,\" Flores explained.,Hechanova said more resources have to be dedicated both to research and to equipping local governments with enough manpower to rehabilitate drug users at the community level.,According to Leo Trovel, director of the Department of the Interior and Local Government's National Barangay Operations Office, more than 96,000 surrenderers are involved in community-based rehabilitation programs. Authorities expect this figure to increase because many local government units are still at the training stage for the program.,Meanwhile, below are figures of drug surrenderers admitted in the health department's TRCs, as of May 2017:,Source: Department of Health,Weiler noted that the DOH is \"investing a lot of energy and resources into catching up as quickly as possible\" toward developing a \"more sophisticated\" drug treatment system.,\"Before there was reliance on the residential patient treatment \u2013 that was basically the main modality, almost the only modality of treatment that was officially available,\" the WHO representative said.,\"I think there's now realization that a comprehensive system also needs other elements: residential treatment, yes, but also community-based treatment and community support groups, and aftercare, and different elements that make [up] a more comprehensive system.\",He said that while it is \"unlikely that in 6 years there will be no more drug use at all in the Philippines,\" what can be achieved in the next 5 years is the development of that comprehensive drug treatment system. ,\"We've seen a lot of activities, we've seen at least from the health side, from the DOH side, really a lot of goodwill and engagement by DOH, and I think if that continues in that same manner, I think there can be a lot of progress [that] can be made in the next 6 years,\" Weiler added. \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/174021-drug-addiction-duterte-war-drugs", "title": "Drug addiction is a health problem.

Besides being among very recognizable women in Philippine show business, they may have struggled with some form of domestic violence or intimate partner abuse.,\u201cIntimate partner violence\u201d or domestic violence is when one person in a relationship purposely hurts another person physically, emotionally, and sexually, according to the United Nations.,While these women may be famous, they share a similar story with thousands of women (and some men) nationwide.  ,Violence no laughing matter for Ai-Ai,The usually jolly comedic actress had tears flowing down her face when she confirmed that her short-lived marriage to Jed Salang had ended.,Ai-Ai said he hit her. \u201cHe threw me on the bed, slapped me, and wrestled me,\u201d she said in Filipino on ABS-CBN\u2019s \"The Buzz.\"  ,The actress\u2019 arguably best known film role was in the comedy series ,Ang Tanging Ina,, which began in 2003. In the film, Ai-Ai played the role of Ina Montecillo, the quirky and hilarious mother of 12 children to 3 dead husbands. As Ina, she had not been the luckiest in her love life. ,In real life, Ai-Ai was also unlucky in her love life. She had been dating Salang, for over a year before they wed on April 3 in Las Vegas. ,Ai-Ai thought she had found what she was looking for and had finally found the perfect fairytale ending, but as it turned out, the joke was on her.,The fairytale is over,\u201c,I gave him everything he dreamed of and did everything to make him happy.\u201d ,Or so she thought.,A car wasn\u2019t enough for Jed, Ai-Ai said. The fight was over where to celebrate their first monthsary. \u201cHe wanted to go to the casino, but I didn\u2019t want to go there because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for him,\u201d she lamented. That was when he struck her. ,\u201cAll I wanted was to have a fairytale. Where we would have happy pictures on Instagram,\u201d she said, but that never happened.,While Ai Ai was able to walk away after a month, in reality, most women don\u2019t. ,Only 3 months into the relationship, she was warned by a friend of Salang \u201cthat he planned to do this to me from the beginning.\" S,he told Boy Abunda, host of ,The Buzz, ,\"He was just going to get what he wanted from me and then leave me.\",Ai-Ai has requested the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to grant a restraining order that would bar Salang from coming closer than 100 to 500 meters of her, her children, and the househelp.,There will be no church wedding on December 8 as they originally planned it. ,She still loves him, she says, but she claims she won\u2019t stay.,Even Pilita,Sultry Cebuana singer Pilita Corrales stayed with her allegedly abusive husband Amado del Paraguay for 10 years before she left him.,\u201cIt was very bad, I was beaten up. At one time, I lost my voice and the doctor said it will come back after one month,\u201d Corrales said in an interview with ABS-CBN\u2019s ,Pipol,.,She blamed the alcohol.  ,\u201cOnce he would take a drop of alcohol, I would brace myself,\u201d Corrales said, explaining how she would already anticipate when she was going to get hit or beaten up.,The multi-awarded singer has sung with acclaimed international acts like Sammy Davis Jr, The Beatles, and Frank Sinatra, and has produced at least 40 international and local albums in English, Spanish, Tagalog and her native Visayan. ,With an illustrious career like hers, it is difficult to imagine she ever suffered such brutal beatings for that long.,Why didn\u2019t she just leave? Even Pilita didn\u2019t seem to know the answer. \u201cI thought if I leave him, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am, I\u2019d have to look for someone else. I don\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d she said.  ,And now? \u201cThe next day I would leave,\u201d Corrales said with confidence. \u201cI won\u2019t stay an hour.\u201d,\u2018Why doesn\u2019t she leave?\u2019,Experts say loneliness is one reason, but there are more.,The abuser might be in control of the victim\u2019s finances; a lack of support from friends, family or the community; and embarrassment, or shame \u2014 especially from victims who are from religious or conservative backgrounds, said Anamabel Garcia, officer-in-charge and counselor of the Women\u2019s Crisis Center (WCC).  ,\u201cA woman may feel incomplete without her partner. Societal expectations might be too heavy. Also many women internalize the deeply traditional role of the family,\u201d Garcia said.,\u201cMany women would prefer to sacrifice, especially in our country, where family comes first. Women would prefer to sacrifice themselves than risk losing their children,\u201d Garcia said.,Hoping for change makes it all the more difficult to break away from the unhealthy relationship. Intimate partner abuse is not limited to physical violence. Verbal and financial abuse can be just as emotionally damaging as getting hit.  ,Taboo,\u201cTo end the violence we need to start talking about it,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe can\u2019t say \u2018it\u2019s not my business\u2019 any longer.\u201d  ,According to the WCC, almost 60 to 70% of reported violence against women involves some sort of physical, emotional, or sexual intimate partner abuse.,It was worse in the 1990s, but even until today, many abused women are ashamed to speak up, Garcia told Rappler. ,Garcia said that violence will not stop \u201cif we keep minding our own business.\u201d  ,\u201cIf neighbors hear something, they should let the abuser know they can hear him,\u201d Garcia said.  \u201cEveryone in the neighborhood, the men especially, should let him know that violence inside his home is not just his business and will not be tolerated.\u201d,Garcia told Rappler about the successful program in Cebu called \u201cBantay Banay\u201d (\"Family Watch\" in Visayan.) The program includes training neighbors to be pro-active in watching out for domestic abuse.  \u201cThey are supposed to come out and bang on pots and pans if they hear a couple fighting,\u201d Garcia said. ,\u201cThe next step would be to send the men of the village in to warn him to stop.\u201d It may work for some neighborhoods, but what if the abuser was good at hiding it? Even worse, what if he was a high-profile personality? ,An unhappy ending,This may have been the case of Carlson and the reason behind her suicide.  Maria Theresa Carlson was a Filipina American beauty queen and actress who married politician Rudy Fari\u00f1as. Many suspect that the reason she committed suicide is because of abuse.,Fari\u00f1as was just elected mayor of Laoag City and was a fast rising political figure.,The stories of abuse began floating around Ilocos in the 1980s. Maria did not get much help until it was too late.,Fari\u00f1as has denied any accusations of abuse.  ,(,Read more about Maria Theresa Carlson here,) ,Support,Carlson\u2019s story partly inspired the introduction and passage of the Anti-Violence against Women and their Children Act of 2004, which criminalizes the act of violence, and carries a prison term and penalties for those convicted. ,This law defines domestic violence not just as physical and sexual abuse, but also covers economic and psychological abuse. ,The Women and Children Protection Center of the Philippine National Police recorded over 12,000 reported cases of domestic abuse in 2012. And there are probably thousands more that went unreported.,In Metro Manila, the WCC was one of the first organizations founded to help women and children victimized by intimate partners and other forms of abuse. ,According to the WCC, one in 5 between the ages of 15 and 49, have experienced some form of physical abuse. About 9.3% of victims report to the police and only 6% seek help from a social service organization.,A first,The law protecting women and children was a first and important step in curbing intimate partner violence in the Philippines.  ,In a study released by the World Health Organization, 40% of women worldwide were slain by an intimate partner, and being assaulted was the most common kind of violence women experienced.,Lawyer Claire Padilla said there have been bright spots since the law was passed. More women have been filing protection orders and cases against their partners. Before the law was passed, the prescriptive period for causing slight physical injury was 1-30 days in prison. Under RA 9262, the abuser could be imprisoned for up to 30 years.,What about domestic violence against men? According to the ,Mayo clinic,, intimate partner abuse against straight males and those in same-sex relationships happens more often than we think.,This also came up in a recent Rappler Hangout discussion on ,violence against women,.,What can we learn from their stories? That domestic violence cuts through social classes. It can't be kept behind close doors and ignored and it must be fought on every level.      ,Click here, to learn more about domestic violence and resources available. - ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/32514-domestic-violence", "title": "Domestic violence no laughing matter", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/nation/32417-speaker-belmonte-benaldo-suicide-attempt"},

Many call center agents lead unhealthy lives.MANILA Philippines The Contact Center Association of the Philippines CCAP wants call center workers to become active in fitness programs to keep not only themselves but the businesses they sustain healthy. xa0 xa0The Department of Labor and Employment DOLE is on board as its environment control division chief Nelia Granadillos said call center agents are exposed to a host of xa0potential work related stress that can affect their health. xa0She cited the extreme cold in their offices and most importantly the long hours they spend seated behind computers. xa0 xa0No less than the American Cancer Society found that sitting too much will likely shorten your life. Over the course of the 14 year study cited in CNN and conducted on over 100 000 adults 40 of women and 20 of men were more likely to die if they had sat down for more than 6 hours a day. xa0Yet physical exercise was found to actually decrease the risk of contracting some cancers heart disease and diabetes according to multiple health experts cited in USA Today. xa0 xa0At a press conference announcing the 4th call center fitness program CCAP executive director Jojo Uligan puts the number of call center agents who are physically active after work at only 20 30 . He said ideally they would increase that to 80 of the work force. xa0 xa0Sam White Senior Director for Human Resources at Automatic Data Processing ADP said many industries suffer the same problems. It s not an industry issue but more of a dietary issue across the nation. But he did point out that since many call center workers are relatively young they need to be educated about healthy lifestyle choices.IN UNISON. From left to right ADP s Sam White CCAP s Jojo Uligan and Chris Sports Arleen Lindo agree about prioritizing physical fitness for call center workers at a press conference announcing their fitness program for 2012. This involves a call center wide olympics with basketball badminton table tennis billiards and darts.He said the median worker s age at ADP is 26 27. Uligan said looking at the profile of the industry most workers are 23 24 years old. xa0 When you have a workforce at that age there s a certain level of maturity that has to develop said White. If you choose to work in an environment that has a night shift you have to have the maturity to say that you cannot live 2 lives because that s going to contribute to health issues he added.He said there was a crucial need for workers to eat and sleep properly.Attrition rateGiven the high rate of workers moving from one call center to another it may come as no surprise that the entire Contact Center Association of the Philippines is behind a call center fitness program. xa0Uligan said the industry attrition rate was 18 20 in 2011. White pointed out that the figure represents those who leave the call center industry all together but some companies can hit 50 to 70 turn over in workforce because of employees moving around within the industry. xa0White said ADP aims for a low 15 20 cumulative attrition rate since the HR services they offer require heavy training meaning it s important to retain employees and keep them healthy. xa0Other leaders in the call center industry agree that fitness is a worthwhile business expense. xa0Since the average call center worker is young in demand and a key breadwinner an investment in health would benefit not just their companies but their families as well.

Jeremy has a master's degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: ,Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality ,and ,Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.,Dear Dr Holmes and Mr Baer:, ,I am 18 years old and I have been in an on-and-off relationship with this guy for 3 years. We ended our relationship 2 years ago, but we continue to have communication and treat each other all the same, just without the title. ,I guess I have to go a few years back so you could know the story. I was already friends with him since elementary and we liked each other since then. High school came and we went to different schools, but still maintained contact. He asked me to be his girlfriend. I loved him so I said yes. The first few months were great. I am not really a high maintenance girlfriend so the time he allocated to spend with me was more than enough.,But after some time, we were communicating less and less, and even became rare for us to do so. He went to a challenging and well-known high school, so I tried hard to understand that he was busy with schoolwork and so I was really understanding that no matter how much it hurts, and no matter how much I felt like I was being set aside, I kept my mouth shut and endured it. I tried telling myself that I deserved someone who'll appreciate me, but every rare time he texts me, I just felt so happy. I realized that I did not want to lose him. ,I endured that for a year until Valentine\u2019s Day. I received no greeting from him. I received flowers, chocolates and sweet nothings from others. But not even a text from him. A text would have been more than enough. I guess I just wasn't able to take it. I knew he was not that busy cause it was their Sportsfest and they had it near our school. I didn't need flowers or anything. I just wanted to know he actually still thought of me. I waited the whole day, but nothing. ,After a few days, I called him and told him I was breaking up with him. He asked me why and pleaded with me not to. But I had reached my breaking point.,After more than a year, we again regained communication. He asked me if we could try again, that he would make time for me this time. ,I,, being a love drunk idiot, said yes again. And the cycle went on again: first few months were okay. ,Then barely communicating. He texted me, then disappeared again for a month or so. Then texted me again like it was nothing. (Yes, our relationship became limited to texts and a few calls).,We decided to break up. But what use is it when without the title, the cycle just keeps on repeating and I keep on accepting him with open arms?,I'm in love with this guy. I tried to be with other men, but after a while, I'd realize that I still loved him and I was being unfair to the guy I was with, and I would break it off with them.,Should I move on? But how? It has been two years but every time he texts me, it feels like it makes my whole day. I don't even see any other guy I want to spend my future with but him. ,Was I the one wrong? Maybe I was overreacting about him not giving me any time and should have understood him more? I am really at a loss here. ,Gwenn, ,Dear Gwenn,, ,Thank you for your email., ,I wonder whether your definition of love is actually the root of your problem. , ,Your relationship with your boyfriend (let's call him Lito) began 5 years ago when you were 13 and he asked you to be his girlfriend. You agreed because, you say, you were already in love with him. Why this was the case and what form this love took, you do not tell us., ,After Lito slowly but surely disappeared from your life, you broke up because you had reached \"your breaking point.\" What actually constituted this point is not explained, but we can perhaps infer that it was Lito's almost total absence and failure to communicate.,Then the cycle began again, only for him to disappear once more. Now you are broken up, but unable to move on because you still love him., ,Relationships are in some ways like careers. The vast majority of us have no real idea what we want to do in life at the age of 13. We gradually learn that our initial notions of what it means to be a firefighter or lawyer or vet (or other fancy that grabbed us as we grew up) are far from the gritty truth of what those jobs actually entail., ,We therefore want to gather information and experience, based on which we hope we will find the path that will lead us to a fulfilling working life. A small minority however know from very early on that they want to be a doctor (or whatever) and never suffer the majority's uncertainties.,So it is in relationships. A tiny minority meet their future spouse early on and never deviate from their chosen path while the rest of us bounce from relationship to relationship, much like one of those steel balls in a pinball machine, acquiring experience gradually by trial and error, learning that love can take many forms and come round more than once., ,Consider the changes that take place in the lives of young people as they pass through their teens. They start as children and emerge as adults. Body shapes alter dramatically, their social skills develop as they gradually eschew teen activities and embrace adult activities, they rely less and less on support from adults and become more and more independent, taking ever greater responsibility for their own decisions.,Emotionally they move towards full maturity and want to be recognized as adults. They start making future plans, setting longer term goals and doing all this on their own.,And so it is with romantic relationships. In the early teen years these tend to develop within larger groups between people who share similar interests. Often interactions are limited to texting or phone calls.,As teens age, they become more familiar and comfortable with the opposite sex, mainly in social settings.,Companionship rather than intimacy is generally the focus but selection shifts from purely physical characteristics to include personality and character (girls make this shift earlier than boys, and some boys never make it)., ,The next phase is that the larger groups break down into paired relationships and the focus changes from companionship to intimacy, and often sexual activity.,Intimate relationships often then lead to a committed relationship and ultimately to marriage (or something similar) eventually.,Against this background of constant change and based on the little that you have shared, it seems that your definition of love has not developed much since you were 13. Your definition of love is founded on shared interests from 5 years ago and limited social engagement via texts and phone calls.,The shift to intimacy and commitment has not taken place because Lito has not made himself available for it to happen, and based on your history together, he never will. Your relationship is thus in limbo, incapable of development while Lito persists in his policy of non-engagement., ,You have a choice: wait for the leopard to change his spots or acknowledge that a real worthwhile relationship requires two people, both of whom are willing to commit themselves to an intimate and exclusive pairing., ,All the best,,JAF Baer, , ,Dear Gwenn:,Thank you very much for your letter. I shall mention 3 factors which bear thinking about, and all can be expressed in memes/clich\u00e9s, which thus make them seem (N.B. seem is the operative word \u2013smile) mababaw (superficial) but so much easier to remember., ,\u201cIf someone wants to be a part of your life, they\u2019ll make an effort to be in it.  Don\u2019t bother reserving a space in your heart for someone who doesn\u2019t make an effort to stay.\u201d  , ,You, after all, have made efforts for him \u2014 to understand his paucity of texts, to convince yourself that a mere Sports Fest is sufficient reason to ignore you on V-day, to not compare others who took the time and, yes, the effort to send flowers, chocolates and sweet nothings with your boyfriend, etc.\u2014and he seems to have made none\u2026.except for the first few months., , But you know something, Gwenn, if merely keeping in touch becomes an effort so early on,  then \u201csomething is rotten (not only) in the State of Denmark\u201d (Hamlet, Act I) but also in his heart., ,Is the ,Screwing You\u2019re Getting Worth the Screwing You\u2019re Getting,?  is the catchy title of a book which weights the pros of having sex and the cons connected with STDs, unwanted pregnancies, being left unceremoniously etc. Does it, in some itty bitty way, also remind you of your relationship vis a vis the joy of knowing he is your bf and yet the pain of realizing he doesn\u2019t care enough to communicate regularly?, ,Look I am not saying he is a bad guy. He can be the greatest guy in the world and will make the lucky woman in his life very happy, given time. At the moment, however, only his mother knows that., ,Let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt and agree that he is terrific boyfriend material but is just not ready.  In other words, \u201cright guy, wrong time.\u201d, , Is he worth suffering for then?  , , I, personally, think not. When the right time comes along, I am almost certain he will pursue you, most probably the first girl/woman he ever loved, once more, no matter where you are and who you\u2019re with. , ,I say, don\u2019t hate him, but seize every opportunity you can to be with other people (both men and women) and enjoy life as much as you can! If he\u2019s there, terrific; if he isn\u2019t, bummer, yes, but don\u2019t let it stop you having a good time, even if you have to grin and bear it (smile). ,In time, not hearing from him will be less painful, being with others will be more fun, I almost 100%-ly promise you. I also promise to write a \u201cClinical Notes\u201d column explaining why hopefully later this month., , ,The very best of luck to you, dearest Gwenn, an 18-year-old far more mature than many women of 40 are.  ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Need advice from our Two Pronged duo?

Albert and Arturo Martinez Jr.", "date": "2015-02-25T03:00:00+0800", "content": "\nThe benefits from income growth could trickle down if the additional incomes are used as investments to create more jobs for the poor    , ,One does not need the Pope to tell us this reality, since one can merely look at towering skyscrapers adorning the skyline in Metro Manila, and informal settlers that also thrive at the backdrop of these high-rise buildings to get a sense of inequality in the country.,As far as income inequality is concerned, data (see Table 1) from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), a survey conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) every three years, shows that the poorest 20% Filipinos own only less than 5% of the country\u2019s total income while in a perfectly equal society, the poorest 20%, the next 20% all the way to the richest 20% Filipinos, should own 20% of total national income. Moreover, this level of inequality has been unchanged as shown by various measures of inequality such as the Palma ratio and Gini coefficient.,Table 1. ,Selected Statistics on Income Inequality and (Per Capita) Income Distribution in the Philippines: 2003, 2006 and 2009,Note: Author's calculations from FIES 2003, 2006 and 2009.,Socio-economic inequality is a growing concern not just in the Philippines, but across the world.,The Gini coefficient for income/expenditure of selected ASEAN countries is listed in Table 2. When this table is seen together with the performance of these countries in reducing poverty in the last few years, it can be observed that generally, countries that have made significant improvement in reducing poverty among ASEAN economies are those with low levels of inequality, or with reduced inequality.,Table 2. Gini Coefficient across Selected ASEAN Countries: 1990, 2000, and Latest Year,Source: 2014 World Development Indicators,Inequality may threaten social cohesion and heighten tensions since it portrays inequitable distribution of economic opportunities. Some argue, however, that (income) inequality should not be immediately portrayed as a problem. As an economy expands, entrepreneurs with better command over assets and capital would be in a better position to benefit from economic growth.,As these people\u2019s incomes grow faster than the income of the rest, the process creates inequality. But, the benefits from income growth could trickle down if the additional incomes are used as investments to create more jobs for the poor.,In a previous ,article,, it was pointed out that we do not have clear evidence to suggest a reduction in poverty because instruments used in the two household surveys of the PSA used to generate estimates of poverty in the first half of 2012 and in the first semester of 2013 are not comparable. Poverty data from the 2006 to the 2012 FIES suggest that poverty rates have been unchanged since minute differences in the estimates are within margins of error. ,It may seem puzzling why despite the growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (at an annual rate of 3.3% over the past decade), the income poverty rates and inequality measures in the country have been unchanged. A key element to understand this puzzle is income mobility.,Income mobility in the Philippines? ,Income mobility describes the ability of people to partake in socio-economic opportunities created by economic growth.,In a ,policy note, and a ,discussion paper, released at the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, we report on our independent work examining movements in the incomes and expenditures of households surveyed by the PSA during the period 2003 to 2009.,An estimated 75.15% of the population in 2003 was non-poor, and, of which 66.88% remained non-poor but 8.28% became poor in 2006.,In 2003, about a quarter (24.85%) of the population was poor, of which 16.95% remained poor but 7.90% became non-poor in 2006. Thus, between 2003 and 2006, poverty inflows were practically equal to outflows for the entire population. That is, the share of the population that was non-poor and that became poor (8.28%) was practically equal to the share of the population that was poor that became non-poor (7.90%).,Of an estimated 20.5 million poor persons in 2003, 6.5 million moved out of poverty, but 6.8 million moved into poverty.,A ,recent study, by Martinez et al. (2014) on the distribution of expenditures suggests that almost half of the households experienced mobility in their expenditures from 2003 to 2009. About half (51%) of households that started in extreme (expenditure) poverty in 2003 moved up the expenditure ladder, but 77% of households that started non-poor moved down the expenditure distribution.,[1],[1], \u2018,Is there income mobility in the Philippines?,\u2019 Journal article written by Martinez, Western, Haynes and Tomaszewski and published in Asian-Pacific Economic Literature.,Table 4. ,Expenditure Transition Matrix, 2003 - 2009,In general, Filipinos have experienced income and expenditure movements. Another paper about to be published by Martinez and his co-researchers found that approximately 11% of Filipino households experienced slow expenditure movements, 31% experienced consistently upward expenditure movements, 24% noted consistent downward expenditure movements, and 34% observed highly fluctuating expenditures.,All these studies conclude that there is volatility in the income and expenditure distribution, and that roughly the same number of households experienced upward and downward movements in income or expenditure.,Consequently, while there is significant income mobility in the Philippines, there is a strong offsetting force: for every household that experienced upward income mobility, there is approximately one household that experienced downward income mobility.,There is also a strong offsetting force over time because a significant fraction of Filipinos experienced income volatilities, with income growth being followed by income reductions (and vice-versa). Together, these factors contribute to the lack of changes in poverty rates and income inequality at the aggregate-level.,Figure 1. ,Different Types of Income Trajectories, 2003-2009,Source: Martinez\u2019s computations on the longitudinal subsample of FIES 2003, 2006 and 2009. ,In summary, it is not the case that economic growth has not led the poor out of poverty. ,Empirical data from comparable surveys suggest that economic growth has coincided with a significant fraction of the initially poor getting out of poverty.,However, this poverty reduction has been offset by the number of initially non-poor falling into poverty. To make economic growth truly inclusive, the government should not only be concerned with the poor, but also it must have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.,Policymakers need to develop public policies on risk management such as adequate insurance and social protection coverage. While some social protection mechanisms such as the conditional cash transfer are promising to yield long term effects on income distribution, it will be important to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of existing social protection infrastructure in the Philippines because if left unaddressed, income shocks may hamper the thrust for inclusive growth and for sustained prospects of the country\u2019s development. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Dr. Jose Ramon \"Toots\" Albert is a professional statistician who has written on poverty measurement, education statistics, agricultural statistics, climate change, macro-prudential monitoring, survey design, data mining, and statistical analysis of missing data.

The 76 year old was summonsed to appear before Melbourne Magistrates Court on July 18.No details of the charges were given and Patton would not take any questions citing the need to preserve the integrity of the judicial process.Catholic officials said the cardinal would return to Australia after receiving xa0advice and approval from his doctors. He has again strenuously denied all allegations... He said he is looking forward to his day in court and will defend the charges vigorously the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney said in a statement.Australia does not have an extradition agreement with the Vatican but has one with Italy.A lawyer for two unnamed men who had made abuse claims against Pell said they were over the moon about the charges. It s been very difficult for them to stick their neck out xa0Ingrid Irwin told Melbourne s Herald Sun. To come out against someone who is second to God in some people s minds has caused all sorts of problems for them. The repercussions on the church s future could be significant long time observer and editor of Australian online forum Catholica Brian Coyne told Agence France Presse. This is the most senior person in the church who has ever been charged and the implications are both huge for the future of the Catholic Church in this country and internationally Coyne said. Pope Francis must be feeling the heat at the moment and some embarrassment having his number three senior manager facing these sorts of allegations. Mucked up The announcement coincides with the final stages of a long running national inquiry into responses to child sex abuse ordered in 2012 after a decade of pressure to investigate widespread allegations of institutional pedophilia.The royal commission has xa0spoken to thousands of survivors and heard claims of child abuse involving churches orphanages sporting clubs youth groups and schools.Pell has appeared before the commission three times once in person and twice via video link during which he admitted that he mucked up in dealing with pedophile priests in Victoria state in the 1970s.The Pell charges stem from investigations by a Victoria police task force into allegations emanating from the royal commission and from a state parliamentary inquiry.The royal commission released data in February that showed seven percent of Catholic priests were accused of abusing children in Australia between 1950 and 2010 but that the allegations were never investigated.Some 4 444 alleged incidents of pedophilia were reported to church authorities and in some dioceses more than 15 of priests were perpetrators it heard.Pell was ordained in Rome in 1966 before returning to Australia in 1971 and rose to become the nation s top Catholic official.He had been accused of historical sex abuse claims when he was the Archbishop of Sydney in 2002 but was later cleared of any wrongdoing.Pope Francis who called him to the Vatican in 2014 said last year when asked about allegations against the cardinal that we must avoid a media verdict a verdict based on gossip .Patton stressed that the cardinal had been treated the same as anyone else in this investigation .Coyne said Pell had been a divisive figure in the church in Australia for a long time and had a very conservative agenda that did not reflect the views of many Catholics in the country.The percentage of Australians identifying as Catholics has slipped in recent years from the most popular religion at 25.3 in 2011 to 22.6 last year falling behind no religion .The Pell charges followed an announcement Wednesday June 28 that the Pope had defrocked an Italian priest Mauro Inzoli who was found guilty of sexually abusing minors reversing an earlier decision to reduce his punishment.

Photo from the Marcos camp  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Former senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr visited the 6 Ilocos Norte officials who remain in detention at the House of Representatives despite a Court of Appeals (CA) ruling ordering their provisional release. ,Marcos went to the House Legislative Building on Thursday, June 15, 17 days since the following Ilocos Norte officials were cited in contempt and detained by the House committee on good government and public accountability for giving dismissive answers in a hearing:,\"We are pursuing every legal recourse that will be available for us for them to be released. Whatever the case needs to be filed, then we will answer that in court,\" said Marcos, the brother of Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos.

The panel then cited the officials in contempt and detained them.  ,The Ilocos Norte camp has since secured a ruling from the CA Special 4th Division ordering the provisional release of the 6 officials, as long as they post bail of P30,000 each.,But the House leadership refused to release them, with Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez even calling the CA justices who granted the order ,\"idiots.\",Bongbong Marcos claimed the 6 officials are \"beginning to suffer symptoms\" while in detention because they supposedly are not able to rest properly.  ,He also pointed out that the officials used to work for Fari\u00f1as, who previously served as governor of Ilocos Norte.,Caught in the middle?,On Thursday, Marcos gave a letter to Alvarez from the detained Ilocos Norte officials, who are asking the House to respect the CA order. ,Marcos, however, said Alvarez was not in his office. The former senator has also been trying to get in touch with the Speaker, but Marcos said Alvarez is \"very busy.\" ,\"We are separate branches of government\u2026 It is very rare that any branch defies the order of the judiciary, which is exactly what is happening now. And over what?\" said Marcos.  ,The 6 Ilocos Norte officials find themselves in the middle of the political feud between Fari\u00f1as and the Marcoses.,Since 1998, the Fari\u00f1as and Marcos families have either been allies or rivals in Ilocos Norte after the Marcoses returned to the province when patriarch and late dictator Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in 1989.,In 2015, the Marcoses cut ties with Fari\u00f1as and dropped him from their \"One Ilocos Norte\" ticket., \u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/173059-cruel-house-detain-ilocos-norte-officials-bongbong-marcos", "title": "'Cruel' for House to still detain Ilocos Norte officials \u2013 Bongbong Marcos", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/nation/172543-house-defies-ca-order-release-detained-ilocos-norte-officials,http://www.rappler.com/nation/171264-house-subpoena-imee-marcos-tobacco-fund-probe"},

Abdul Moheming, 26, thought he was used to the clashes in his neighborhood. Rappler photo  ,MARAWI CITY, Philippines \u2013 He's not one to run away at the first sound of gunfire. Abdul Moheming is your curious neighbor who likes to know what is going on in his neighborhood.,When the government clashes with local terrorist groups began on Tuesday, May 23, Moheming ran to the battlezone in Basak Malutlut to see what was happening. He was not afraid of the military, the Maute Group whose fighters are Maranaos like him, and apparently of getting caught in the crossfire.,\"Tinitingnan namin bakbakan nila sa Markaz, sa unahan dito ng Malutlut. Kaso hindi namin malapitan. Ang mga sundalo sabi hindi puwedeng lumapit sibilyan, (We were checking out the clashes in Markaz, at the mouth of Malutlut. But we couldn't go near. The soldiers said it was off-limits to civilians),\" Moheming said in a voice that was almost complaining.,He heard everything though. He knew when the two camps exchanged gunfire, when artillery was fired, when choppers were hovering, and when they were dropping bombs.,On Day 5 of the clashes, he had seen and heard enough. Rappler found him in a corner street near the provincial capitol on Saturday, May 27, apparently taking a break after a long walk from his house in Tacu out of Marawi City.,\"Sanay ako sa bakbakan. Kaso lang sobra na ito. Sira-sira na bahay doon. Ginamitan ng bomba, malalakas. Hindi na namin kayang pakinggan, (I'm used to clashes. But this one is too much. The houses were destroyed.

He spoke about seeing headless bodies sprawled on the streets of Malutlut, the smell of decomposition filling the air. ,\"'Yung makita 'nyo sa daan, mga ulo at napugutan ng ulo. 'Yung mukha iba na.  Kaya 'yun na nangamoy ang daan. Ewan ko sino ang mga 'yun. Christian ang mga 'yun ,(You will see on the road severed heads and the bodies. The faces look mangled already. It's why the roads smell bad. I don't know who they are. But they are likely Christians),\" he said.,These are the civilian hostages killed by the Maute Group, according to a Rappler source. Rappler also overheard cops planning the retrieval of these bodies on Saturday at the provincial capitol.,The military said the Maute Group and a faction of the Abu Sayyaf Group \u2013 among the two local terror groups that have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS) \u2013 have combined forces to turn Marawi City into a caliphate.,Like ISIS, the Abu Sayyaf and Maute have notorious records of beheading civilians. ,\"Nakakatakot din 'yun kapag nakikita mo 'yung nakita namin doon na wala nang ulo sa Malutlut. 'Yung unang bakbakan doon ,(You'll be afraid if you see what we saw, the headless corpses in Malutlut.

The military did not expect the capablity of the ISIS sympathizers to fight back.,\"Noon mga rido lang. Patay-patay lang sa daan. Ngayon nagsobra na ngayon. (,Before, it was just rido. They kill each other on the streets. This war is something else; it's too much),\" Moheming said.,Moheming fled as troops poured into the city.

However, even if APIS 2013 made use of the 24-page income module of FIES 2012, this would still not make poverty data from the APIS and FIES comparable since FIES also asks households detailed information on their expenditures (before income questions are asked) using a total of 78 pages of questions (taking an average interview time of 5 hours).    ,The APIS 2013 questionnaire had 6 pages of questions on expenditure, aside from 19 pages of income questions, and several pages of other questions, which, over all, took 3 hours to accomplish. ,Consequently, official poverty statistics in the first semester of 2013 are incomparable to those based on the FIES 2012.  We have apples and oranges here, so there is no certainty about a drop in poverty, as has been claimed. ,On the other hand, can't we look at self-rated poverty from the Social Weather Stations (SWS) surveys? No, since these SWS statistics are based on showing respondents face cards with a line running across these cards. Below the line is marked \u201cpoor\u201d and above the line, \u201cnonpoor.\u201d Each respondent is then asked, \u201cWhere would you place your family in this card?\u201d SWS self-rated poverty statistics are likewise incomparable to income poverty statistics. Here, we have apples and bananas. ,To get definitive recent trends on income poverty, we have to await the results of the 2014 APIS. ,Unchanged poverty rates,Three clear trends on poverty conditions can, however, be seen from past runs of the  FIES: (a) poverty rates have been ,unchanged, in the first semester periods from 2006 to 2012, since minute differences in estimates are within margins of error; (b) poverty rates also have been ,unchanged, in the full year periods from 2006 to 2012;  (c) estimates of the proportion of Filipinos who are poor are lower in the full year, compared to first semester figures, on account of extra income received from thirteenth month wages and bonuses, and other income received in the second semester. ,Since poverty rates are unchanged, the number of poor Pinoys is increasing on account of population growth.,But why hasn\u2019t poverty incidence changed? , Changes in poverty rates result, if there is a rise in incomes (in real terms), or if there are changes in income distribution. Between 2009 and 2012, all segments of income distribution had rising incomes, but the rise in incomes was commensurate to the increase in prices. ,The poor are not really getting any poorer: their incomes are rising, albeit only as fast as inflation. Regarding income distribution, it can be noted that measures of income inequality, such as the share of the bottom 20% in national income, and the Palma ratio (defined as the ratio of the income of the top 10% to the bottom 40%) have both been unchanged from 2009 to 2012.  ,Thus, the entire income distribution rate also remains unchanged., ,The PSA\u2019s ,technical notes, point out that the source of poverty data in the first half of 2013 is the 2013 Annual Poverty Indicator Survey (APIS), another survey of the PSA, which used a different questionnaire from that of the 2012 FIES.  , ,Table 2. ,Selected Statistics on Income Distribution and Income Inequality:  ,2009, and 2012,PShare of Bottom 20% in National Income,5.04%,5.03%,Palma Ratio,2.73,2.71,Does this suggest that programs such as ,Pantawid Pamilya,, the government\u2019s Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program, have failed? Not really. The CCT was designed not as a short-term solution for poverty reduction, but rather a mechanism to assist poor households to break free from intergenerational poverty by investing in the education of their children, and health of their household members. ,Positive outcomes,The effects of ,Pantawid, on poverty are expected to take time, when beneficiary children that have better education and health get into the labor market.  Unfortunately, CCT critics and even some ,Pantawid, supporters expect the program to have immediate impact on poverty reduction. The CCT has various positive outcomes on the poor, and this will be discussed in a subsequent article. ,Expecting quick changes in poverty because of ,Pantawid ,is unrealistic, especially since in 2012 poor families, which have an average family size of 6, needed, on average, P29,765  to cross the poverty line, while CCT beneficiary families only received a maximum of P15,000 grants in 2012 (P300 per child per month for 10 months for a maximum of 3 children, plus P500 per month for twelve months for health support), if they satisfied their co-responsibilities.   ,So, the CCT cash grants are truly \u201c,Pantawid,\u201d especially in the wake of disasters and other income shocks. Still, many analysts are convinced that had we implemented ,Pantawid, a decade ago, we would be reaping benefits of lower poverty incidence and lower income inequality today., ,In summary, we do not yet have evidence of changes in poverty or income distribution. ,Still, this does not suggest that the CCT is not working since cash grants in ,Pantawid, are not enough to help the poor cross the poverty line. The grants are supposed to incentivize the poor into investing in human capital. Also, climate change is a game changer. Blaming gets us nowhere, folks. ,Certainly, there are challenges in making economic growth inclusive. We all have to work together. Everyone, especially our taipans, has a role to play in ensuring that no one person is left behind as we pursue economic development. ,- Rappler.com, ,Dr. Jose Ramon \"Toots\" Albert is a professional statistician who has written on poverty measurement, education statistics, agricultural statistics, climate change, macro prudential monitoring, survey design, data mining, and statistical analysis of missing data.

The campaign against illegal drugs has begun even before President-elect Rodrigo Duterte sits in Malaca\u00c3\u00b1ang. ,MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) \u2013 The crackdown on drugs is intensifying in the Philippines, with the police killing 25 suspected drug dealers roughly a week before President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office. ,Philippine National Police (PNP) spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wilben Mayor told reporters that the 25 suspects were killed from June 16 to 20, or an average of 5 people a day in separate operations. ,Mayor said according to the PNP\u2019s Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management records, the latest breakdown of the killings of drug suspects by the police are as follows:,This is on top of the 29 other suspects whom the PNP killed in its anti-illegal drugs operations starting May 10, a day after the 2016 elections that saw the landslide win of Duterte. (READ: ,PH gets taste of Duterte anti-crime war,) ,This means that from May 10 until June 20, a total of 54 suspected drug dealers have been killed by the police. The body count rises to 68 if the suspects killed from January 1 to May 9 are included. More drug suspects have been killed after June 20 as well.,\u201cThe reason those suspects were killed was because there was a shootout between the police and the suspects. The lawmen involved were abiding by operational procedures. There [was] imminent danger on their part,\u201d Mayor said.,\u201cPart of the investigation is to determine the circumstances behind the operation and why the suspects were killed,\u201d he added.  ,Duterte has promised to suppress crime and illegal drug use in the country within 3 to 6 months. ,He already offered ,million-peso bounties, for the capture or death of drug lords. He said a dead drug lord would merit a P5-million reward, while the amount would be several thousands of pesos if the drug lord is captured alive.,The President-elect has also endorsed ,citizens', arrest and capture of those involved in the drug trade.,End drugs, but no to 'anarchy',Will the number killed drug suspects continue to rise once Duterte is seated as president?

So far, it is only the small fry who are tumbling down. There must be a method to the operations that would lead to and expose the big bosses \u2013 the top drug honchos, their protector politicians, and police officials in high places,\u201d said Jimenez.,He then called on President Benigno Aquino III and outgoing PNP Chief Director General Ricardo Marquez to check the accountability of the police officers. ,\"We welcome all drug syndicates to be wiped out from the face of the earth. They are the scourge of the land. But we don't want anarchy like this,\" said Jimenez.,\"So now that President Aquino, who still leads the country, is still in control of his overzealous police officers, we call on him to check them out and not allow this situation to fester,\" he added.,List of suspects killed ,DEATH BY DRUGS. 54 illegal drug suspects have been killed during police operations from May 10 to June 20. ,Here is a running list of illegal drug suspects killed since the 2016 elections, as reported by the media:,May 23-27,: Police said ,8 unidentified suspects, died after 3 separate police raids in Manila, another near the capital, and the third in a small town in the northern Philippines.

Policemen, fire and rescue teams, volunteers, and disaster responders wasted no time and quickly filled a major street in the country\u2019s capital. The man on the radio just announced that a very strong earthquake hit Manila. ,Fortunately, it was all just a drill. ,Recently,  the Manila city government, together with national agencies, tested the government and community response in case ,\u2018the big one\u2019, strikes.,Watching the earthquake drill from the sidelines, I couldn't help but notice the dissonant responses from the people. ,While rescuers and responders rushed to various disaster scenarios, only a few took the city-wide tsunami and earthquake drill seriously \u2013 the rest either took selfies, welcomed the much-needed break from work, or ignored the drill all together.,RESPONSE. Many people don't take earthquake drills seriously. Photo by David Lozada/Rappler ,Bigger disaster,I neither had to look for the missing fire in the buildings nor check for the debris that should be obstructing the major highways. The short and slow strides, calm expressions, and almost stoic responses of the people were enough to remind me that it was just a drill.,I was disheartened. Considering the ,country\u2019s long history of typhoons, and the combo mega disasters that recently battered the nation \u2013 Habagat, the Visayas earthquake, and Super Typhoon Yolanda \u2013 I hoped for ,a more informed and cooperative response from the people,.,The drill made me realize that disasters don\u2019t always become natural calamities. More often than not, disasters happen because of wrong policies.,But in the case of the Philippines, the bigger disasters that it faces are, first, the lack of an innovative and sustained information drive; and, second, an uninvolved citizenry. ,What if there were a real earthquake? Would they respond differently? More importantly, would people know ,what to do and where to go,?,SCENARIO. Hazards in case of a strong earthquake in Manila include fire, building collapse, liquefaction, and tsunami. Photo by John Uy/Rappler ,Perennial problem,According to Manila disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) chief Johnny Yu, this is a common problem whenever local government units (LGUs) conduct emergency drills. ,\u201cMany civilians don\u2019t take emergency drills seriously. They only become serious when the actual disaster scenario happens,\u201d Yu explained in Filipino.,This is the reason why the  ,Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, Director Renato Solidum emphasized the importance of a ,sustained information drive, coupled with an effective capacity-building of communities. ,After all, how can individuals and communities prepare for disasters if they are not made aware of the consequences they will face and what they can do to avoid these? How can they appreciate the importance of the drill if they don't see its significance to their lives and the lives of the people they love? ,\u201cYou have to think of the potential effects of the earthquake to Manila \u2013 fire, building collapse, tsunami and liquefaction. Given that situation, people should not expect that immediate help will come right away. It is a must for communities to respond immediately,\u201d Solidum said during ,Rappler\u2019s TalkThursday interview, on July 10.,In building more disaster-resilient communities, there are many innovative and comprehensive programs national agencies and local government units can employ. ,In fact, Solidum suggested at least 3 ways for government agencies to capacitate communities: 1) have professional engineers and architects in each community conduct their own 'medical mission' for 'sick houses'; 2) train more volunteer responders; and 3) have the education department institutionalize an assignment for students to prepare and outline an evacuation plan for their own homes. ,Shared responsibility,Disaster experts have \u2013 time and again \u2013 emphasized why it is important to prepare for disasters. Doing so could save thousands of lives, properties, and livelihood. It could even spare the nation billions of pesos in economic loss. ,However, we often associate \u2013 or reduce \u2013 disaster preparedness to a plethora of national programs: flood mitigation, relief operations, evacuation programs, and etc. ,But the truth is, an effective national disaster preparedness program goes beyond that \u2013 it is an individual responsibility as much as it is a national obligation. ,Having said that, here's a challenge for everyone: take disaster preparedness seriously. ,Prepare your disaster kit,. Read on what to do ,before, during, and after a flood,, an ,earthquake,, ,fire,, ,storm surge,, and ,tsunami,. Know your ,internet etiquette during disasters,.

President Rodrigo Duterte has been careful in his statements endorsing the killing of drug users, but human rights groups say he 'implicitly' supports killings in violation of due process. Photo by Rob Reyes/Rappler  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It has been a common refrain between the government and its critics: the latter decries President Rodrigo Duterte's \"shoot-to-kill\" orders against alleged drug users, while the former denies there ever was such a thing. ,As human rights groups, international media, and diplomats begin to take increasing notice of the ,number of drug-related deaths in the Philippines,, it comes with criticism against what they perceive as the government's tacit endorsement of extrajudicial killings.,The harrowing images have been splashed across international news outlets: photos of slain people with their faces wrapped in tape, usually beside a cardboard sign saying: \"I'm a drug pusher, do not emulate me.\",But the relatives of some of the victims insist that their loved ones ,did not fit the profile, of a drug user, or were simply at the ,wrong place at the wrong time,. ,One US senator said Duterte was ,endorsing, \"what amounts to mass murder.\" Human rights groups point out that vigilantes have grown emboldened because of Duterte's many statements defending and even promoting the killing of alleged drug users who fight back.,Even before the start of the campaign period for the May 2016 polls, Duterte had already promised to ,order the killing of criminals,. But he emphasized that this should only be done if they fight back.,This caveat has been the government's consistent defense against criticism that it endorses extrajudicial killings.,Shoot to kill, DIY arrests,Duterte has long been vocal about his hardliner stance against illegal drugs. His campaign threats to kill drug users, he said, were not rhetorical.,Several months since the May polls, the Philippines is seeing the concrete evidence of that statement: thousands have been killed in Duterte's bloody war on drugs, some of them under questionable circumstances. (READ: ,'Nanlaban sila': Duterte's war on drugs,),In May, shortly after winning the elections, Duterte said he would give security forces ,\"shoot to kill\" orders, against those who resist arrest. ,He also said he would offer ,million-peso bounties, for the capture or death of drug lords.  ,But he was quick to add: \"I'm not saying you kill them but the order is 'dead or alive.'\",The President has made several pronouncements in the same vein, issuing shoot-to-kill orders but immediately clarifying that it should only be done if the suspects resist arrest.,He has made this call not only to law enforcers, but to ordinary citizens. In June, during a thanksgiving party in Davao City, Duterte endorsed the idea of ordinary civilians engaging in ,do-it-yourself arrests,.,\",Kayong nandiyan sa neighborhood ninyo, (Those among you in your respective neighborhoods), feel free to call us, the police, or do it yourself if you have the gun, you have my support,\" he said.,If a suspect resists arrest, \"you can kill him,\" Duterte said.,The President added, \"Only if your life is in danger, ,at lumaban, at may baril din at kutsilyo, barilin mo, (and there is resistance and the suspect is armed with a gun or knife, shoot). I'll give you a medal.\" ,'Layered' messages?,Aside from issuing shoot-to-kill orders, Duterte has vowed to ,protect the policemen, who do their duty, even if they kill a thousand people in the course of their work.,\"Do not bullshit with me but do your duty, I will die for you. Do your duty and if in the process you kill 1,000 persons because you were doing your duty, I will protect you,\" he said in July. ,That message was said even during the campaign period, when Duterte said he would ,pardon policemen, convicted of killing criminals and civilians while performing their duties. ,In August, the President acknowledged that some of those killed in the war on drugs were ,victims of extrajudicial killings,. ,He then echoed the police's defense, insisting that those killed in police operations all fought back. ,In September, however, Duterte's message took on a different tone. In contrast to his earlier pronouncement that only those who resist arrest should be killed, this time, Duterte told soldiers that criminals should be killed ,whether or not they fight back,. ,\"Pagka bumunot, patayin mo. 'Pag hindi bumunot, patayin mo rin, putang ina, para matapos na. Eh kaysa mawala pa 'yung baril. Ako na ang bahala sa inyo,\", he said. ,(If they pull out a gun, kill them. If they don't, kill them still, son of a whore, so it's over, lest you lose the gun. I'll take care of you.),But it's unclear whether the President meant it, because he would later flip-flop on his own statement by saying he would never order the military to commit illegal acts.,\",Hindi ako mag-order ng illegal. 'Wag kayong maniwala diyan,. (I won't order anything illegal. Don't believe that.) I did not order you and the police to perform punitive police action. I have declared war against the drug syndicates in this country. You know what is war. War is war,\" he said.,Asked about the President's conflicting messages, Abella said Duterte's remarks are \"layered.\",But this shoot-to-kill order has been slammed by critics, including Senator Leila de Lima. De Lima, a former justice secretary and former chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, said that such an order should only be a last resort of law enforcers.,Senator Panfilo Lacson also agreed with De Lima, saying that ,shoot-on-sight or shoot-to-kill orders, not used for self-defense would be murder. ,Killings 'not a gov't policy',In the face of mounting criticism over the death toll in the war on drugs, Malaca\u00f1ang has defended itself by saying that extrajudicial killings are ,not a policy, of the Duterte government. ,\"Notwithstanding the accusations hurled against him, no formal charge of human rights violations has been filed. Alleged EJKs (extrajudicial killings) are not the policy of his administration,\" Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella said last month.,Abella also ,told the United Nations, that Duterte, as a lawyer and former prosecutor, \"knows the limits of the power and authority of the presidency.\" ,Various groups, such as Human Rights Watch (HRW), pointed out however that Duterte's statements constitute an ,\"implicit\" support, of killings in violation of the rule of law.,\"Duterte implicitly voiced support for such unlawful brutality by stating that police can rightly put illegal drug suspects 'below the ground' if necessary,\" HRW's Phelim Kine said.,He added, \"President Duterte must publicly recognize that respect for rule of law and fulfilling the human rights of Filipinos extends to all Filipinos, including criminal suspects and those implicated in the drug trade.\",Should the President's statements be interpreted as a tacit approval of drug-related killings? In his public statements, Duterte is careful to add that killing should be done only if necessary. But with 2,294 victims of extrajudicial killings ,as of latest figures, \u2013 and with investigations into these deaths still pending \u2013 these drug-related killings remain a cause for concern for the Philippine government. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/148295-philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-statements-shoot-to-kill-drug-war", "title": "Shoot to kill?

In some cases, it\u2019s surprisingly enlightening and even relatable.,The \u201cqueen of talk\u201d recently launched an online series called \u201c,The Kris List,,\u201d where she gets to experience stuff she\u2019s always wanted to try (camping beside Caliraya Lake!) or acquire new lessons from familiar things (such as driving or making breakfast). Talented artists, writers, and even the vice chairman of a real estate group joined in on her adventures.,As the episodes showcased Kris\u2019 candid attempts to fulfill her very own bucket list, she liberally dispensed tips that, taken on their own, actually sound like solid life advice.,Turns out that in life, food, or even road safety, we can all learn a thing or two from the \u201cqueen of talk.\" Here's a sampling:, ,\u201cIf you want something to turn out beautiful, you have to give it time.\u201d,In the pilot episode, Kris took calligraphy lessons from crafter and pattern designer ,Alessa Lanot,. As she learned to cross her t\u2019s and dot her i\u2019s with extra flair, she mused aloud that in life and calligraphy, space and time are needed to achieve perfect results. Patience, practice, and going with the flow makes things better., ,\u201cFamily is the time you give the ones you love.\u201d,Spending a whole day outdoors is a rare treat for Kris, especially if she gets to do it with son Bimb. The calm atmosphere at Caliraya Lake inspired her to see her past failed relationships in a positive light: without them, she won\u2019t have her sons. For her, love is what makes a family complete, regardless of roles or luxuries., ,\u201cThere is merit in doing things step by step\u2026 and patiently waiting for all of it to come together.\u201d,In episode 3, Kris asked her designer friend Avel Bacudio to teach her how to make authentic laing, the way true Bicolanos prepare it. They only use fresh leaves and high-quality meat and do ,not ,mix the leaves with the pork. In this day and age where everything is instant and available with a few clicks, it\u2019s especially rewarding to still enjoy things that go through a thoughtful process, such as recipes from home., ,\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s really the journey that counts.\u201d,For moms like Kris who often travel with their kids, road safety is important. As motoring journalist James Deakin took Kris for a spin around the city, he reminded her about fundamental road rules, such as doing a visual check of the car, or controlling your temper even if the traffic (or a fellow driver) isn\u2019t cooperating. Dash cams are a great tool, too, Deakin said, because people will generally behave better if they know they\u2019re being recorded. , ,\u201cSimple recipes are really delicious\u2026 because they come from love.\u201d,In the 5th episode of the series, Kris learned how to make a dinner-worthy breakfast with the help of a chef from the Purefoods Culinary Center. As she whipped up fancy brittle pancakes from scratch and prepared crepes using simple ingredients such as hotdogs and ham, she mused on the challenges of being a working mom: after a busy day at work, she\u2019s tired and she doesn\u2019t have the energy to make a big meal for her family. But even if she just makes a quick and easy dish such as eggs or waffles, her kids love it. \u201cThey never really forget that,\u201d she said., ,\u201cPeople who have the courage to overcome great odds are the people who inspire us.\u201d,Many people have heard of the W Group of Companies that owns several buildings in Bonifacio Global City. But few have met its Vice Chairman, Rosalind Wee. In the 6,th, episode, she told Kris about how she and her husband started out with small businesses such as silk-screening t-shirts, selling fish in Divisoria, or renting out movies. With hard work and determination, they grew their wealth from a simple seaweed used in countless food items like ham, sausages, and even ice cream. \u201cIn this world, nothing is easy. You have to work hard for it,\u201d Mrs. Wee told a visibly moved Kris.,So what do you think? Did you find these life lessons relevant? What should Kris do next on her list?

US President Donald Trump right and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan deliver their statements after a summit at the White House on May 16 2017. Screengrab from White House video WASHINGTON DC USA US President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stood side by side at the White House on Tuesday May 16 and promised to strengthen strained ties despite the Turkish leader s stern warning about Washington s arming of a Kurdish militia.Fresh from securing his grip on Turkey with a referendum to enhance his powers Erdogan came to the Oval Office with complaints about US support for Kurdish fighters and what Ankara says is Washington s harboring of the mastermind of a failed coup.But both leaders also tried to put a brave face on their differences and to renew a key alliance between NATO s leading power and its biggest Muslim member partners in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq ISIS . xa0 It is absolutely unacceptable to take the YPG PYD into consideration as partners in the region and it s going against a global agreement we reached Erdogan said referring xa0to the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units YPG in Syria. In the same way we should never allow those groups who want to change the ethnic or religious structures in the region to use terrorism as a pretext he added suggesting that the Kurds are using the anti ISIS fight as cover for separatist nationalism.Trump was one of the first leaders to congratulate Erdogan on winning the April 16 vote to strengthen his office and his Turkish counterpart repaid the compliment on Tuesday by hailing his host s legendary triumph in the US presidential race. Of course Mr Trump s victory has led to an awakening of new expectations for Turkey and the region it is in. We know the new US administration will not let these hopes be in vain Erdogan said.The US leader paid tribute to Turkey s historical contributions to the Western alliance s Cold War battles and promised Today we face a new enemy in the fight against terrorism and again we seek to face this threat together. Attempted coupWashington and Ankara are bitterly at odds over US support for the YPG a Syrian armed faction that acts as the main ground force in the Pentagon s plan to defeat the Islamic State group but that Turkey deems a front for the banned Kurdistan Workers Party PKK .And Erdogan remains angry that the US continues to host Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen a former ally who chose exile in Pennsylvania and who has now been accused of masterminding last year s bloody attempted coup in his homeland.While the pair shared warm words at their joint public appearance Erdogan again made it clear that he would never accept an autonomous YPG led Kurdish area in Syria and that he had frankly communicated his expectation that Washington hand over Gulen.After their meeting Trump and Erdogan exchanged friendly tweets.The US leader said it was a great honor to welcome his guest and the Turk responded by thanking him and declared I believe today s meeting will strengthen our longstanding alliance and strategic partnership. Sinjar offensiveTrump hoped to secure at least grudging Turkish agreement not to oppose the US led drive by YPG fighters to oust the Islamic State from their Syrian stronghold of Raqa.In return Trump may have had to give Erdogan assurances that Gulen will be closely monitored while the US courts examine an extradition request and pledge that Washington will eventually endorse a Turkish offensive against PKK bases in Sinjar northern Iraq.

Turkish officials had spoken enthusiastically about Trump s election as a chance to turn a new page. READ Erdogan says he will open new page in Turkey US ties with Trump But hopes could have been dashed last week when the Pentagon confirmed that it has increased its support for the YPG by directly arming its fighters ahead of the battle to oust the Islamic State from its de facto capital in Syria.Ankara regards the YPG as simply the Syrian arm of the terrorist PKK which has waged a deadly insurgency inside Turkey since 1984 and Erdogan is worried his deadly enemy will find itself in charge of a US armed statelet on his southern frontier.After Erdogan left the White House tensions over the Kurdish issue spilled out into the streets of Washington.According to witnesses a brawl erupted when the Turkish president s security detail attacked protesters carrying the flag of the Kurdish PYD party outside the ambassador s residence.City police reinforcements restored order but emergency services said nine people were injured and taken to hospital one of them in critical condition.

File photo by Bobby Lagsa/Rappler   ,GRACE POE,The wooing of Poe, who is barely halfway through her first term as senator, is the most public among those being considered. President Benigno Aquino III himself ,met with Poe, at least 4 times in the past few months, with at least two of those meetings with Roxas in attendance.,Although it was never explicitly said to her, Poe admitted in an interview that it seemed as though Aquino was eyeing her to be ,Roxas\u2019 running mate,.,Roxas himself said in a chance interview on August 1 that Poe was still ,part of his shortlist, for vice president.,Poe ran as an independent during the 2013 midterm elections but campaigned alongside the ruling Liberal Party, even donning the party\u2019s trademark yellow in some of its ads. She topped the senatorial race that year. ,But the senator says she wants to ,remain independent, in 2016, should she seek a higher national post.,One of the roadblocks to persuading Poe to forgo the presidency for 2016 and slide down to vice president, if LP allies and sources are to be believed, is Senator Francis Escudero, who is eyeing a higher post come 2016.,The two allies, however, have stated that they are still going to be independent of each other when it comes to their plans for 2016. Thus LP allies are still ,not giving up, on wooing Poe to be Roxas\u2019s running mate, pointing out that it would be a dream tandem.,The idea, LP sources said, is for 12 years of \u201c,Daang Matuwid,,\u201d the current administration\u2019s tagline for its transparency, good governance, and anti-corruption drive. Aquino, in his last State of the Nation Address, said it was possible for the country to reach First World status should his reforms continue.,Aquino remains hopeful that Poe and Escudero would join the \"unified\" ticket in 2016.,\"We are still hoping. We still want to have that very unified group that will preserve the coalition as much as possible that can ensure the victory of the agenda,\" Aquino told reporters on Monday, August 3.,The President warned of the dangers of having a divided coalition and said it might lead to the opposition's victory.,\",Pero kapag naghati tayo nang naghati nang naghati, baka naman maging manipis na manipis 'yung lamang at doon manganib lahat 'yung pinaghirapan natin,,\" Aquino said.,(But if we continue to be divided, we might end up having slim lead over the others.

It was only after the tragic passing of her husband, the late DILG secretary ,Jesse Robredo,, that she entered the fray.,The Camarines Sur representative was among the hundreds of politicians who trooped to Club Filipino on July 31 to witness Aquino\u2019s endorsement of Roxas.,The ties between the two go beyond the political. Roxas was a close friend of Robredro\u2019s from Roxas's time as Department of Trade and Industry chief and Jesse Robredo's term as mayor of Naga City.,Roxas, said the congresswoman\u2019s daughter Aika on social media, was jokingly referred to by Leni Robredo as Jesse\u2019s \u201csecond wife.\u201d,The interior secretary played a prominent role in 2012, when the plane that Jesse Robredo was in crashed off the coast of Masbate. Then secretary of transportation, Roxas himself oversaw rescue and later, retrieval operations.,\u201cHe was the very first cabinet secretary who gave Mama a call when Papa's plane was missing, who kept updating us on a regular basis during the search, and was also the first to let us know when it was found,\u201d wrote Aika in an Instagram post.,Roxas eventually took over the DILG.,According to a source close to Aquino, the Camarines Sur representative is \u201cbeing considered\u201d to be Roxas\u2019 running mate.,\u201cAnd she\u2019s open to it,\u201d the source, who is in talks with both Robredo and the LP, added.,Robredo however has said in previous interviews that she has not been offered anything and that she's only learned about the likelihood of her running with Roxas in newspaper reports.,\"The next important question is: Who should be Mar Roxas\u2019 running mate?

He was rushed to the nearby New Era Hospital then transferred to St Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City afterwards. ,Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr, initially told reporters in an interview outside the hospital that the cause of the incident had yet to be determined. Belmonte later on confirmed Benaldo tried to take his own life. ,Belmonte said ,Benaldo was inside his office at the 5th floor of the South Wing of the Batasan complex when his staff members heard a bang.

This is about recognizing our contribution in history.\u201d,This was the sentiment of 60-year-old Ester Isberto regarding the reparations and compensation for human rights victims of Martial Law. She and her husband were political detainees during the period.,She remembers vividly how their house was raided on Nov 10, 1977. She went through different kinds of torture until she was released in 1978.,Her husband suffered longer as he was released 3 years later in 1981.,\u201cWe were kept in isolation for a few months...,After that, ,doon lang nila kami nilipat sa Bicutan Rehabilitation cente,r,,\u201d Isberto said. ,(We were kept in isolation for a few months. After that, they transferred us to the Bicutan Rehabilitation Center.),Despite this, she considers herself lucky compared to other Martial Law victims.,\u201cI\u2019m still alive and I reached 60 years old, which I never thought I\u2019d reach. Many of us just disappeared and got killed and we don\u2019t even know where their graves are until now,\u201d she added.,Against the flow,When asked about the biggest sacrifice she and her husband made during Martial Law, she answered with teary-eyes and a shaky voice.,\u201cWe opted to take the road less taken. We opted to fight against the very unjust government...These people who went through prison before were not paid,\u201d she said.,Isberto added, \u201cWe were imprisoned because of our belief. We did what was right.\u201d,Despite their sacrifices, Isberto and her husband have not received a single centavo from the reparations owed them.,They are only two of the thousands of Martial Law human rights victims claiming reparations.,Compensation for the victims,SLOW PROGRESS.

But it will degenerate into an unfortunately dead law if it is not implemented soon,\u201d Lagman said.,Claims board,Lagman added it has been 5 months since the bill was signed into law by President Benigno Aquino III. No actions have been taken, however, because the claims board chair and members have not yet been appointed.,\u201c,Walang mangyayari sa ating batas kung hindi manunungkulan ang claims board.

The first are the plaintiffs or those who filed the case. The second are the victims recognized by the court.,New hope?,Lawyer Rod Domingo Jr, who defended the case of human rights victims in the Hawaiian Court, said there is good news in their struggle.,On July 18, lead counsel Robert Swift announced a US$10 million settlement over an artwork owned by former First Lady Imelda Marcos. This means the victims will receive an additional $1,000 each.,\u201cWe are expecting it to be distributed by early next year,\u201d Domingo said.,Domingo noted, however, that only the 7,526 claimants, who have benefited from the ruling of Judge Manuel Real of Hawaii, will receive the additional reparation. The same group also received $1,000 in March 2011.,There were initially 9,539 claimants for the case. 2,000 of them, however, were taken out of the list due to their failure to fulfill requirements. Domingo said the list will be able to accommodate more claimants once the law is implemented.,Domingo said that at least 60% of the victims have already passed away. He added that relatives of victims may also claim the reparations.,Continuing struggle,Lagman noted that the fight for justice during Martial Law is a continuing effort.,\u201cWhen the last of the claimants are rewarded, when the people behind the atrocities are punished, and when another Martial Law is not possible, only then will our task be completed,\u201d Lagman said.,Isberto, on the other hand, expressed her disappointment about the Marcoses still being in power.,\u201cThey\u2019re back...Why is it that in other countries, people really go after the dictators. But here, they\u2019ve come back with full powers,\u201d she pointed out.,She maintained, however, that she still believes that the justice they deserve will be given to them.,\u201cThis entire process of what we\u2019re going through is an improvement.

File photo by Jasmin Dulay/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Ilocos Norte 1st District Representative Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as, the Majority Leader of the House, was declared persona non grata in his own province on Tuesday, June 27.,Eight members of the Provincial Board voted in favor of Resolution Number 2017-06081, which was sponsored by Provincial Board Member Vicentito Lazo and Vice Governor Angelo Marcos Barba.  ,The Ilocos Norte officials approved the resolution amid Fari\u00f1as' political rift with Governor Imee Marcos.,The House good government and public accountability committee is currently investigating the alleged misuse of P66.45 million worth of Ilocos Norte tobacco funds to purchase motor vehicles. Fari\u00f1as initiated the probe along with Pampanga 3rd District Representative Aurelio Gonzales Jr and Pampanga 4th District Representative Juan Pablo Bondoc. (READ: ,Ilocos Norte's tobacco funds go to Imee Marcos' pet projects,),Ilocos Norte Provincial Board Member Da Vinci Crisostomo said that while the persona non grata status means Fari\u00f1as is an \"unwelcome person,\" the House Majority Leader will still be allowed to enter the province.,\"Well, this is in the form of a resolution, and under the parliamentary rules, it is a manifestation or expression of our feelings towards the person. So, what the Provincial Board, whose members were directly elected by the people of the province of Ilocos Norte and representing our constituents, wants to express are the sentiments of the whole province,\" said Crisostomo in Filipino.,Since 1998, the Fari\u00f1as and Marcos families have either been allies or rivals in Ilocos Norte after the Marcoses returned to the province when patriarch and late dictator Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in 1989. ,In 2015, the Marcoses cut ties with Fari\u00f1as and dropped him from their \"One Ilocos Norte\" ticket.,Fari\u00f1as to sue,But Fari\u00f1as, a lawyer, argued he cannot be declared persona non grata since the status can only be imposed upon foreigners. He plans to sue the officials who approved the resolution.,\"I will file cases against them for damages for the violation of my constitutional rights, as well as for a violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for causing me undue injury through evident bad faith,\" Fari\u00f1as told reporters.,\"I am a citizen of this country and no one, especially Sangguniang Panlalawigan members, can declare me, or any other citizen of this country, a persona non grata. Not even convicted criminals are declared as such,\" said Fari\u00f1as, reiterating his leadership position in the House. ,He emphasized that a persona non grata status \"applies only in diplomatic relations, more particularly to aliens.\",Fari\u00f1as had initiated the House probe into the Ilocos Norte tobacco funds after uncovering documents indicating Marcos allowed P66.45 million of the tobacco funds to be used to buy 40 mini-cabs, 5 secondhand buses, and 70 Foton mini trucks.,Under Republic Act Number 7171, 15% of cigarette excise taxes shall be allotted for a special support fund for tobacco farmers, but the money should only be used for cooperative, livelihood, agro-industrial, and infrastructure projects.,The probe has led to the detention of 6 provincial officials for their refusal to properly answer lawmakers' questions.

We embedded the spreadsheet with our summaries of various cross sections of the data to help you analyze this issue on your own.  ,The Marcos camp said that the ,alleged \u201ccheating\u201d script, was introduced to the transparency server at around 7:30 pm on May 9. After that, they said, Robredo started gaining over Marcos. ,The data, however, show that Marcos\u2019 total lead against Robredo still increased for an hour after the correction to the \"\u00d1\" in the result files was introduced. ,The correction was made so that entries that used \"\u00d1\" would read correctly instead of having \"?\" in its place. Thus, entries like \"SE?ERES\" and \"OSME?A\" would read correctly as \"SE\u00d1ERES\" and \"OSME\u00d1A\". ,This is why the Comelec earlier described the fix as a \"cosmetic change\" that did not alter the results. Former Comelec chair ,Sixto Brillantes Jr, who will represent Marcos, in the canvass, also agreed.,What we saw in the data,1., Were the votes that Marcos was receiving dropping?, Yes. But this can be explained by the total transmission pattern. Very soon after polls closed, the b,ulk of polling precincts transmitted their results. This is illustrated in the graph below, which compares transmission times for the ,past 3 elections in the Philippines, which used the automated election system. , , ,Looking at patterns, it is apparent that after polls closed \u2013 from 6:30 pm to 6:40 pm \u2013 the initial surge in transmitted precinct results pushed Marcos' total votes from 1.79 million to 4.78 million. His lead over rival Robredo in total new votes, however, decreased in the succeeding 10-minute intervals.,Ten minutes after the big boost, Marcos got only an additional one million-plus votes vs Robredo's 984,494 votes. Another 10 minutes later, he got only an additional 697,515 votes vs Robredo's additional 613,285 votes. ,Below is a snapshot of the summaries we made of votes for vice president per 10 minute intervals. (You can see the full data summary under Tab A of the spreadsheet embedded below this story.) ,VOTES BREAKDOWN. Table shows how many votes Marcos and Robredo received per 10 minute interval   ,Note that Marcos' lead over Robredo peaked at 8:30 pm at 938,622 votes, a full hour after the big boost, and also about an hour after the hash in the results file changed. This means that the change in the hash had no adverse bearing on his votes. He was still getting a bigger slice of new votes being transmitted. ,The results data also show that way after Marcos was overtaken by Robredo in the unofficial count at 3 am of May 10, there were periods in the transmission when Marcos received more votes than Robredo, further belying the argument of a \"distinct pattern of erosion\" in his votes.,2. If the transmission pattern is the reason why Marcos' votes were going down, and even the new votes Robredo was receiving were going down, how was Robredo able to overtake Marcos?,The explanation lies in bailiwicks and transmission rates. This is a snapshot of the map of regions. Those colored red favored Marcos more, while those colored yellow favored Robredo., ,SOURCES OF VOTES. The map shows which vice-presidential candidate got the most votes in each province and key city   ,If you graph the percentage of precincts from each region that had already transmitted at a particular point in time, it would look like the interactive graph below. Hover over the lines to see the transmission level at each particular point in time. ,The interactive graph below shows precinct results accumulated over time. ,It clearly shows that in the regions that favored Robredo, precinct results transmission was not as fast.,As of 10 pm on election day, May 9, the NCR was almost done transmitting with 94.65% of precincts reporting. Transmission in the Ilocos region was also at 85.88%, while that for Region II was at 83.58%.,Altogether, these regions, known bailiwicks of Marcos, had already delivered 4,540,787 votes for him by 10 pm.,Note that the lines break at some points in the graph. This indicates that no precincts reported from that particular region for that specific hour. You can also double check this graph against the data summaries in the spreadsheet embedded above. ,As of 11 am of May 12, Robredo\u2019s lead over Marcos in the Bicol region amounted to 1.3 million votes. In VII (Central Visayas), she was leading by 700,000 votes. In Western Visayas (Region VI), the gap between her and Marcos was almost 1 million.,Bicol, Robredo's home region, and Western Visayas, home region of administration standard-bearer Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas II, were both rather slow in transmitting results. Western Visayas had transmitted only 77.99% of results at that time, and has, so far, given Robredo a lead of almost 1 million over Marcos.  ,Even as of 3 am of May 10, when Robredo finally overtook Marcos in the count, these regions still had a significant number of untransmitted votes. Only 88% of precincts from Bicol had transmitted at the time, while Western Visayas' transmission rate was only at 87.28%. , \n,Compare the graph above with the graph below which shows at what point Robredo started overtaking Marcos.  ,Robredo first took the lead in the VP race at 3:29 am on Tuesday, the day after election day. At first, her lead was miniscule, a mere 575 votes. ,At 3:48 am with 87.60% of precincts reporting, Robredo continued to pick up the pace at 12,899,569 million votes while Marcos had 12,890,683 votes \u2013 a difference of 8,886., ,You can examine the votes per region further if you go to Tab B of the spreadsheet. Colors in the spreadsheet indicate if the balance of total votes from the region favors Marcos (red) or Robredo (yellow) when the difference between the votes of the two candidates is computed. Again you can view the full data summaries and make your conclusions by examining the spreadsheet embedded below. ,MARCOS VS ROBREDO. The colors of each square on this graph indicate who is the candidate favored by that region. The number is the candidate's lead for that region  ,The end of the 9 pm mark on May 9 indicates a point in the transmission when the number of precincts that transmitted dipped to 2,879 nationwide. The number of precincts reporting picked up again at 10:30 pm as shown in the snapshot below.,Again, you can examine and audit the data by navigating through the spreadsheet embedded below.  ,PRECINCTS REPORTING. This table summarizes number of precinct results received per hour.  ,There are different reasons for varying transmission rates. Some precincts were unable to transmit immediately because (1) there were still voters voting; (2) some precincts encountered signal issues, which is common in far flung areas; (3) failure of elections, which means elections in an area will have to be conducted another day.,Election officers being required to entertain voters within 30 meters from a precinct at closing time was an added factor in transmission delays.,Analyze the data and make your own conclusions,We embedded our summaries so you can independently make your own conclusions. We made the following cross sections of the data:, \n, \n,Note that our analysis is based on the time stamps of each precinct, not on the frequency of updates coming from the Comelec transparency and mirror servers.,The system works this way: new precincts are just appended as additional rows in the results file. This means that even if you analyze only the last version of the file, you should see all the precincts that had transmitted so far, including their time stamps. ,Note that it is easy to produce graphs, but drawing conclusions based on incomplete and flawed data is both dangerous and irresponsible. As data scientists say, the most useful and solid conclusions can be drawn from data that are transparent and capable of being corroborated., \u2013 ,with Russell Shepherd, Dominic Gabriel Go, and Joben Ilagan/,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/132948-vp-results-data-cheating-claim-bongbong-marcos-debunked", "title": "Election data quash Marcos' cheating pattern claim", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/174344-warriors-star-curry-play-second-tier-golf,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132894-human-error-hash-election-results-code-mismatch,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/132819-mudslinging-math-slaying-netizens-vice-president-race"},

A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives.,Together, they have written two books: ,Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality ,and ,Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.,Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer,,When I was 7 years old, my cousin, 14 at that time, taught me how to pleasure myself. I was aroused by the fact that we did it together and that he was teaching me how to do it. I am 20 now and have been questioning my sexuality since. I realized that I liked girls and that it was only a phase, and that I knew I was straight and in actuality, my cousin had just harassed me and robbed me of my innocence.,I have been a member of a varsity team in our university since I was 17. And as any other team in our university, we train a lot during the day then we drink at night. Last year, after a team party at a teammate's (let's call him Gino) place, I was forced to sleepover, as I was too drunk to drive home. Gino and I had to share a bed because all the other beds were already taken. We were close friends so it didn't bother us.,The night went on and I discovered myself holding his thighs and rubbing my package against his butt. I even remember whispering his name. He woke up, got out of the bed and glared at me, disgusted. I was apologizing to him all night and he didn't utter a word. He didn't sleep 'til the sun rose. He drove me all the way to our house, as I was still drunk. It was the most awkward moment of my life. We haven't talked since.,Does this mean that I am not straight? Does my past (aroused by my cousin) have anything to do with all of this? But I am not into men. I like girls. I have had 4 girlfriends.,What should I do? I haven't had the courage to talk to Gino. Should I even talk to him? I haven't told this to anyone yet. He hasn't too, I think.,Please help me., ,James,-----------------,Dear James,,Thank you for your email.,Sexual orientation can be a vexing issue, especially if one is not certain of,,, or resistant to,,, one's leanings. You like girls, have had 4 girlfriends, yet two major events in your life have left you with questions.,In the absence of divine revelation, which most \u2013 if not all \u2013 mainstream religions rule out for masturbation, people are left either to discover this practice for themselves or are initiated by a family member or friend. It makes sense that it is usually a person of the same sex who does, since the techniques are anatomically specific :) Thus, who actually initiated you, James, when you were 7 years old, should not be a significant factor in and of itself, and indeed the fact that you make no further mention of your cousin or others in this connection would seem to confirm this.,Fast-forwarding to the present and the incident with your friend Gino, I would again suggest that one single event when you were drunk should not be blown up into a crisis in which your sexual orientation is suddenly under the microscope. Imagine you were drunk and blindfolded in a room with a man and a woman and someone fondled you. You would, in all probability, react to the stimulus regardless of who the fondler was, and just because it turns out that it was the man should not necessarily mean that your orientation is in doubt.,There is, however, one caveat. You say that you were whispering his name as you rubbed against Gino. This does raise questions, but unfortunately, just mentioning his name is insufficient by itself to be indicative of very much.,Two incidents in a life of 20 years should certainly not be considered more significant than the fact that you like girls and have had 4 girlfriends, though the possibility that you are gay or bisexual cannot be completely ruled out. Either way, a full and satisfying life still lies ahead of you., ,Finally, provided you make sure that Gino understands your position, it is then up to him if he wishes to continue your friendship. If your efforts to reach out to him are rebuffed or ignored, you will have done your best. ,Good luck, ,JAF Baer, ,Dear James, ,Thank you very much for your email. There are so many issues your letter brings up that I hope it is okay if I focus on only 3 of them. ,First, you worry whether your experience with your cousin was the reason you became gay. Actually, the studies that have been done linking earlier homosexual experiences to later sexual orientation have not been conclusive.,Second, you worry about your friend Gino, who may be just as confused about his own sexual orientation as you are, and because you may have aroused feelings in him he has tried to repress, he has become angry at you. Of course, this is only one among many possibilities. In the end, what Mr Baer says in the final paragraph of his letter is true: you cannot force Gino to be friends with you once more. All you can do, perhaps, is find a way to let him know you miss being friends with him. Expect nothing more from him but that, but keep your distance until he is ready to be friends with you once more.,Finally, you also worry whether you are gay or not.  This is definitely not the time to bang on about \u201cwhy you should not be upset about being gay,\u201d because what you want are facts and not an opportunity for attitude change. ,I\u2019m afraid I do not know the definitive answer to your question and I wonder if part of the reason is because there really is not a definitive answer for you, and for most of us. I doubt there is a definitive answer, even for myself.,Dr Alfred Kinsey, author of ,Sexual Behavior in the Human Male ,(1948) and ,Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, (1953) developed a scale, called the Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale, which, is used in research to describe a person's ,sexual orientation, based on their experience or response at a given time.,Introducing the scale in 1948, Kinsey wrote: \u201cMales do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories... The living world is a ,continuum, in each and every one of its aspects. While emphasizing the continuity of the gradations between exclusively heterosexual and exclusively homosexual histories, it has seemed desirable to develop some sort of classification which could be based on the relative amounts of heterosexual and homosexual experience or response in each history\u2026 An individual may be assigned a position on this scale, for each period in his life\u2026 A 7-point scale comes nearer to showing the many gradations that actually exist.\u201d,The results of the studies conducted by Dr Kinsey and his colleagues include the fact that \u201c11.6% of white males aged 20 to 35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives. The study also, reported, that 10% of American males surveyed were \"more or less exclusively homosexual for at least 3 years between the ages of 16 and 55 (in the 5 to 6 range).,\u201d  ,Please remember, dearest James, sexual orientation is not set in stone and whether one is exclusively homosexual, heterosexual, or in-between at one point in one\u2019s life does not mean one will feel that same way the rest of one's life. ,One would just hope that whatever sexual orientation one professes to have is the actual orientation one has because nothing is more painful than having to deny a part of who you are. More to the point, nothing is more joyous than loving the way you are. ,All the best, ,MG Holmes,Need advice from our Two Pronged duo?

Ang bawat ipinapatayong kalsada, tulay, daungan, paliparan, paaralan, farm-to-market roads, at iba pang imprastraktura sa iba\u2019t ibang bahagi ng bansa ay bahagi ng ating estratehiya tungo sa malawakang kaunlaran,.\" (It's clear that the entire budget is based on a serious study of problems and solutions to them. Each road, bridge, school, airport, or farm-to-market road that is built is according to our strategy of inclusive growth.),Budget Secretary Florencio Abad said: \"With this budget, we have doubled the national budget since 2010 and we are providing the largest sectoral allocation to social services. This budget also caps the administration's record of enacting the budget in time for a perfect 6 straight times.\",According to him, next year\u2019s budget is double the first budget that Aquino passed in 2010, which was P1.645 trillion. It is also the 6th and last budget to be passed under the current administration. ,In the last 5 years, the Congress and the Executive had promptly passed the budget, preventing a re-enactment of the previous year\u2019s appropriation scheme.

The focus continues to be on social services that directly benefit individual citizens, such as education and health, both with increased budgetary allocations at P436.5 billion and P128.5 billion, respectively, he added.,\"It can be gleaned that for every P100 of the 2016 budget, around P64 will be spent on social and economic services. This clearly shows how the government is wisely investing on its people, with the foresight of supporting services that will keep serving their needs long into the future,\" said Abad.,Aquino said Abad made sure that the money will be well spent. \",Masusi niyang sinuri ang bawat pahina at detalye ng librong ito, at sinigurong walang mawawaldas ni isang kusing,.\" (Abad scrutinized each page and detail, and made sure that not a single cent will be wasted.),The 2016 budget contains increased funding for different ,government agencies,.,Among those that received the highest allocations are:,Other notable inclusions in the budget were the P64 billion allocation for the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Program and the doubling of the Vice President\u2019s budget from P230 million to P500 million. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund was also allotted P38.9 billion.

Compared to the traditional line-item based budgeting, it links funding to results,\u201d Abad said. ,\u201cThis enabled agencies to meet their targets and timelines and address the causes of underspending, such as problems in procurement,\u201d he added. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/116749-aquino-signs-national-budget-2016", "title": "Aquino signs P3.002-trillion national budget for 2016", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/116176-congress-ratifies-2016-budget,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/159002-2017-national-budget-duterte-promises,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/171463-nadine-lustre-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/nation/115418-bicam-approves-2016-budget,http://www.rappler.com/nation/116176-congress-ratifies-2016-budget"},

Several math experts provide interpretations on Leni Robredo's rise in the vice presidential polls. ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 From mudslinging to math-slaying.,This is how ,netizens are describing the social media posts, of several math experts trying to make sense of the data explaining Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Leni Robredo\u2019s rise in the vice presidential race.,Vice presidential bet Senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr initially led the race during the first few hours of the transmission of election results on May 9, based on the ,Comelec-GMA7 Mirror server,. ,By 3:40 am of May 10, however, Robredo snatched the top spot from Marcos., ,The sudden surge of Robredo in the race, according to Marcos, amounts to \"strange developments.\" Marcos quickly alleged the possibility of cheating in the unofficial results. (READ: ,Unyielding Marcos says Robredo's rise in tally 'strange',),\"It was a very measured increase in the votes that doesn't seem to follow what our internal surveys are saying,\" he explained.,Marcos also insinuated ,dagdag-bawas, (point shaving) by citing two reports where Senator Francis \"Chiz\" Escudero lost more than 30,000 votes at the time Robredo earned the same number of votes. The Marcos camp insisted on the allegation even after GMA-7 and CNN Philippines had already apologized and said they had committed a typographical error.,Fortunately, various Filipino math experts were quick to provide possible explanations to the trend. ,Too good to be true? ,There are two fundamentally opposing mathematical interpretations that have surfaced on social media: one backing up the cheating allegation, and another refuting the claim. ,Is Robredo's rise a result of cheating? The almost perfect trendline, according to David Yap, a former instructor of the Ateneo de Manila University and Antonio Contreras of the De La Salle University, is suspicious. (,Editor's note: An earlier version of this story referred to Antonio Cotreras as Alvin Contreras. We made the necessary changes. We apologize for the error) ,Employing a trendline on the ,rise and fall of Marcos ,in the unofficial results, Yap and Contreras said that the equation resulted to an almost perfect line.,\"My mathematical side tells me that when increases and decreases in votes that are supposed to be coming randomly from diverse areas in the country with different political preferences become a straight line, then reaches a point where it is reversed, that something might have been programmed,\" Contreras said. ,In his ,analysis,, Contreras also assumed that \"bailiwick votes could not be used to explain the sudden downward trend of the lead of Marcos over Robredo, considering he is also strong in Region 8 in the Visayas, and Regions 11 in Mindanao.\",Yap's analysis particularly triggered a flurry of counter-interpretations from experts in the fields of statistics and mathematics. ,Yap was scheduled to give a talk, entitled \"Analysis of Voting Patterns in the Vice-Presidential Race\" on Friday, May 13, at the UP School of Statistics, but the forum was cancelled at the request of Yap, who cited \"concerns about his security.\",'Misguided assumption' ,Many mathematicians and statistical experts said that the model used by Yap and Contreras does not provide the best method to interpret the unofficial results, especially because it uses cumulative data.,Filipino ,MA student at Columbia University ,Arnold Lau,, ,UPSE PhD candidate ,Adrian Mendoza,, and UPSS assistant professor ,Peter Julian Cayton, \u2013 among other math experts \u2013 agreed with this. ,In his analysis,, Jan Carlo Punongbayan, also said that Yap and Contreras' interpretation is anchored on a critical misguided assumption: supposed randomness of the transmission of election results.,Punongbayan is currently a PhD student at the UP School of Economics, where he also graduated summa cum laude and valedictorian in 2009,.  ,He also served as the Head Executive Assistant at the National Economic and Development Authority from 2014-2015.,NOT SUSPICIOUS. This graph showing the growth rates of the votes of Bongbong Marcos and Leni Robredo show that there is no evidence that Robredo's votes grew disproportionately vis-\u00e0-vis the growth of Bongbong\u2019s votes. Graph by Punongbayan  ,Instead of analyzing the unofficial result by looking into the linear trends of the gap, Punongbayan examined the growth rates, their moving averages, and their correlations. ,The graph produced by Punongbayan showed that the growth rates of both Marcos' and Robredo's votes actually showed similar patterns. ,\"Whatever advantage Leni has derived thus far into the race came from the accumulation of very small gaps between these otherwise highly correlated growth rates,\" Punongbayan added. ,Punongbayan further broke down the data by taking the moving average over time. It reflected the same result: \"There ,does not seem to be any evidence to suggest that at any point of the race Leni's votes grew disproportionately vis-\u00e0-vis the growth of Bongbong\u2019s votes.\" ,Logarithmic trend and common sense ,Miguel Barretto Garcia, echoed this, saying that \"what Yap and Contreras may have forgotten to factor into their analysis is the transmission rate of the votes.\" Garcia is currently a Filipino PhD student at the University of Zurich. ,\"The assumption of randomness does not hold because we are looking at aggregate data and the rate of transmission of votes has a systematic rate of increase: a logarithmic one,\" Garcia said. Meaning, the increase of votes is exponential and when visualized shows a curve in the graph.,GRAPH. This snapshot taken while Marcos was leading Robredo by more than 200,000 votes show that the distribution and transmission of votes follow a logarithmic behavior. Graph by Miguel Baretto Garcia ,\"Why transmissions behave in a logarithmic manner has a very simple explanation: Luzon and Metro Manila votes (which heavily favored Marcos) came in early and it quickly reached above 90% transmission in the evening of May 9. On the other hand, the Visayas and Mindanao votes transmitted data at a much slower rate, especially if you happen to live in far flung islands or in areas with dense forests,\" Garcia added.,The graphs produced by Garcia showed that Marcos' early lead in the unofficial results may be attributed to the early reporting of areas where he led by wide margins \u2013 most of them provinces from Luzon.,Marcos is banking on the \"Solid North\" to win the country\u2019s second-highest elective post. The \"Solid North\" refers to the Ilocos region and nearby provinces. (READ: ,Which home provinces delivered for presidential, VP candidates?,) ,This analysis is simulated ,here. ,Echoing the same argument in simpler terms. Reina Reyes, the ,Filipina scientist who proved Einstein right,, stressed that \"the votes did not come in randomly. This much is clear from the data/common sense/news reports, that assuming otherwise must be disingenuous, while ironically claiming authority through technical jargon.\",\"You can see how the dramatic overtake is clearly driven by votes coming in from Visayas and Mindanao,\" suggesting that in the end, it is simply about geography.,Analysis and solutions,Responding to the variety of mathematical interpretations, political analyst, Clarissa David warned readers, against \"experts\" claiming to be able to prove cheating through graphs and analyses. ,\"There is a right and wrong way of doing analysis. It starts with the humility and foresight to know and state assumptions. No amount of data analysis will make up for incorrect assumptions,\" David added.  ,On Thursday, May 12, Comelec Chairman Andres Bautista ,denied that cheating took place,. He said that the change in the hash code of the data package containing election results was merely \"cosmetic\" in nature.,Comelec Commissioner Christian Lim added that the hash code issue has been ,blown out of proportion,.,Marcos is trailing Robredo in the unofficial tally as of 9:34 pm on Thursday. Robredo has 13.99 million votes as opposed to Marcos' 13.76 million., \u2013, ,Rappler.com ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/132819-mudslinging-math-slaying-netizens-vice-president-race", "title": "From mudslinging to math-slaying: 'Experts' clash on VP race result", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132625-bongbong-marcos-leni-robredo-rise-tally-strange,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132505-home-provinces-cities-deliver-president-vp"},

A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives.,Together, they have written two books: ,Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality ,and ,Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.,Dear Dr Holmes and Mr Baer,,Call me New, a public servant. I have a girlfriend. She's a beauty. A flight attendant (don't know if the article on people being in an aviation service being cheaters are true). She tells me her family is beyond average in terms of net worth. Tells me I'm lucky to have her. Tells me she loves me. Of course she's had past relationships. The one before me was worse to the point that her ex-BF physically attacked her (and I am outraged, as public servant). Of course I did have my own stories of failed relationships, the one before her was also bad. , ,So in short, we both do not want to get hurt any further. So to make it simple, I am very open to her. I'm being myself before her to the point that I let her open my phone and read all my messages and convos to make her think that I'm sincere (well I really am). But the thing is, when I attempt to open hers, she disagrees to the point that when I force her, she gets really angry. Every time I talk about it, she gets angrier (paulit-ulit daw ako (she says I keep saying the same thing over and over)). The heck? She wants me to be open to her but she doesn't let me? How unfair could that be? ,She told me she was a playgirl (paasa) to some past guys she's been talking to for revenge (which I still don't know who they are up until now). Since we became a couple, she has this habit of texting or chatting really really often that I don't know if she considers me her lover. I don't know if she's been or still is talking to other guys. I just can't fully trust her, you know? Telling her that how could I love her fully while she's doing things like that? I'm hurt. I'm confused. Just that. ,New,-------------,--------,Dear New,,Thank you for your email.,Your account of your relationship with your girlfriend (let's call her Cora) makes it sound a little out of kilter. On the one hand, she is beautiful, richer than you, happy to tell you how lucky you are to have her as a girlfriend and has a penchant for secrecy and possibly revenge on her ex-boyfriends. On the other, you are a humble public servant, sincere, happy to let her see your phone and want an open and honest relationship.,A good relationship is defined principally by the two people in that relationship. A foundation stone must surely be that you share a common understanding as to what constitutes \"good\" in this context. Whether it is opposites can attract or shared interests, whether you have similar socio-economic and educational backgrounds or believe that rich and poor can be happy together etc. etc., in the final analysis it helps to agree from the outset.,Equally, there are negatives which if ignored will erode a relationship until it collapses. Dr John Gottman, co-founder of the Gottman Institute, has spent over 40 years researching couples and their relationships. He has identified what he calls the ,Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,, which are communication styles that can predict the end of relationships. These are criticism, contempt, defensiveness and stonewalling.,Based on your account of your relationship with Cora, you do not share the same goals and most if not all the horsemen are present. Dr Gottman prescribes specific antidotes and these are briefly:,For more detail click ,here,.,Try applying these to see if Cora is amenable to searching for a solution to your joint problems, though frankly I would be surprised if she is even willing to recognize that she has a role to play in these issues.,If she does, there's hope for a future together; if she doesn't, it's time to move on separately. ,All the best,,JAF Baer,Illustration by Alyssa Arizabal/Rappler ,Dear New,,Thank you very much for your letter.  In truth, I am so, so happy that Mr Baer wrote the answer he did above, mainly because all he said was factual and just as importantly, like a good psychologist (which all of us can be, even if we don\u2019t have a degree in it) he did not prescribe/strongly suggest you do something. What he did was present the options to you and asked you to decide.,Thus, I feel I can be a little more directive/prescriptive than that., ,First, if you want this relationship to continue, I feel you must insist on couples therapy.  It is likely that she will refuse. After all, a woman who feels her boyfriend is \u201clucky to have her\u201d usually also has the view that there are more men like you waiting in the wings.  ,Why should she waste her time and energy doing something for a relationship she may not put as much value in as you do? Better to switch to someone else who will not ask for things she is unwilling to do.  ,I could, of course, be wrong. But even if she does agree, a part of me feels she would be doing this as a lark and/or out of curiosity and/or because she\u2019s bored, etc. In other words, she may not be invested in this as much as you are.  ,Caveat: My answer is based on the belief that everything you have told us is accurate, okay? That, while \u201cthere are always two sides to every story,\u201d what you relayed in your letter about what you and she are willing to share in your relationship is true.  ,You are willing to be honest and open, not only about your past relationships, but also about any interactions you may have with others. She, on the other hand, is secretive about any other relationships she may have at the moment.,Two days ago, I wrote a ,Clinical Notes column, ,that talks about not just the danger, but the certainty that relationships where even one party (like Cora) has secrets about things she\u2019s done or said since the relationship started would affect said relationship terribly.,Cora does one thing more. She not only has secrets, but doesn\u2019t hide the fact that she is keeping things from you. She not only keeps things from you, but seems to revel in making you feel bad that she does, A-N-D that there is nothing you can do about it.,But there is, isn\u2019t there?  You can up and leave her\u2026 and I must admit this is what I wish you would do.,One chooses relationships that validate one's partner, and make them feel someone has their back when things are tough. Cora gives me the impression she is not in your corner. In truth, she seems to be exactly the sort of person someone in your corner would protect you from. ,SO... perhaps instead of couples therapy, it would be better if you went to therapy for yourself, exploring, among other things, the reasons you would allow anyone to treat you the way Cora has.  ,All the best,MG Holmes ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/156327-two-pronged-flight-attendant-cheating", "title": "[Two Pronged] My flighty flight attendant", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/171463-nadine-lustre-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez"},

How has it been allocated to fulfill the many promises Duterte has made to the Filipino people?,Rappler takes a close look at the 2017 General Appropriations Act and compares it to the 2016 General Appropriations Act to see what changes the Duterte administration has brought to the budget to fulfill the President\u2019s vows to citizens. ,How much larger are funds for law enforcement agencies this year so they can continue waging the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d? ,Will the bigger budget be felt in places like the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao after Duterte promised development in all corners of the country? How much will be allocated to the popular conditional cash transfer program?,Top 5 most well-funded agencies, ,Duterte previously said, if elected president, he would make agriculture, education, and health his 3 top budget priorities. In the 2017 budget, the Department of Education makes it to the top 5 most well-funded agencies. ,While the agriculture and health departments are not on the list, funds for agriculture and health have made their way to other programs not necessarily under the two departments.,Funds for campaign promises,Is Duterte\u2019s determination to fulfill his campaign promises reflected in the budgets for agencies that will be fulfilling these promises?,A comparison of the 2017 and 2016 budgets shows increases in almost all agencies and programs that have to do with his campaign pledges \u2013 from suppressing illegal drugs to spending more on transportation infrastructure. ,Changes in budget from 2016 to 2017:, ,Suppress drugs, crime by March 2017 (new date due to extension),Budgets of crime-fighting agencies increased substantially, with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency budget, for instance, posting an almost 100% increase. Duterte\u2019s own confidential and intelligence funds are 400% higher than former President Benigno Aquino III's last year.,Philippine National Police,Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency,Dangerous Drugs Board,Office of the President\u2019s confidential and intelligence funds,National Intelligence Coordinating Agency,Rehabilitate drug addicts,Rehabilitation of drug addicts is phase 2 of the campaign against illegal drugs, according to the Palace., ,Double salaries of military and police in 3 years,Talk peace with Communist Party of the Philippines, Moro separatist groups,Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process,The huge increase is because of the P7 billion for PAMANA projects to be implemented by OPAPP. In previous years, OPAPP merely monitored the projects while they were implemented by other agencies. ,PAMANA is a program that funds infrastructure and social development projects in conflict areas in the belief that peace can only be achieved by addressing poverty, one of the causes of violence in the areas.,Decentralize economic growth,Internal Revenue Allotment for local governments, ,Local Government Support Fund,Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,Mindanao Development Authority,Prioritize education,Department of Education,Commission on Higher Education,P8.3 billion of CHED budget for free tuition for college students in state universities and colleges,State universities and colleges,Improve Conditional Cash Transfer program,Department of Social Welfare and Development,Conditional Cash Transfer program,Prioritize health, improve access of poor to free healthcare,Department of Health,Health Facilities Enhancement Program,Assistance to Indigent Patients,The P3 billion increase for PhilHealth was approved to cover all Filipinos in a \u201cuniversal healthcare program\u201d and so that \u201cindigent patients will not have to pay for anything in government hospitals under the No Balance Billing (NBB) policy,\u201d said Senate finance committee chairperson Loren Legarda.,P4 billion was allocated for \u201cassistance to indigent patients,\u201d an increase from the P2.9 allocation in 2016.,P1.5 billion was also allocated for the Doctors to the Barrio program, construction of additional health facilities, and medical assistance to indigent patients, added Legarda.,Improve transportation, development infrastructure to spread economic growth, decongest Metro Manila,Department of Public Works and Highways,Department of Transportation,P850 billion was allocated for the construction of road networks in cities and provinces, sea ports, airports, school buildings, and hospitals.,Provide free irrigation,Help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs),Department of Trade and Industry,Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Development Council Fund,P1 billion was allocated under the Small Business Corporation \u201cso it can provide loans at almost no interest to microenterprises,\u201d said Legarda.,Fight terrorism, secure national borders,Department of National Defense,Help overseas Filipino workers,Philippine Overseas Employment Administration,Commission on Filipinos Overseas,Notables about Duterte\u2019s first budget,Higher than usual funds for social protection,Social Watch Philippines (SWP), a non-governmental organization scrutinizing national budgets since 2006, spotted some unique characteristics of the 2017 budget.,Among recent administrations, the Duterte administration has allotted the biggest percentage of its budget to social services.,Based on SWP\u2019s analysis, P1.3 trillion or 40% of the national budget is for \u201ceducation spending, health care spending and social protection like direct cash transfers,\u201d said Isagani Serrano, Social Watch Philippines co-convener and president of Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement.,\u201cCompared to previous budgets, that\u2019s bigger. During the Aquino administration, it did not hit 40%, it was always around 30%. It was even lower during Gloria [Macapagal Arroyo\u2019s] time,\u201d he told Rappler.,He commended the administration for higher conditional cash transfer funds, new rice grant funds under CCT, and the P19.4 billion Assistance to Disadvantaged Municipalities.,\u201cIt\u2019s going to help because that\u2019s a direct transfer. Any additional transfer to the poor municipalities, any real transfer that happens to the poor is something to be welcomed for us,\u201d he said.,Serrano thinks the large budgets for education, health, and social services go well with the Duterte administration\u2019s goal of bringing down the country\u2019s poverty rate to 14% in 2022 from 21.6% in 2015. But he thinks the government can do better.,\u201cThis is a huge promise and the government can be probably commended for putting it at that ambition level, but for us, it\u2019s still not ambitious enough. We want to see extreme poverty ended under the Duterte regime,\u201d said Serrano.,Is government funding the right infrastructure?,The P850-billion infrastructure budget seems poised to create more jobs and spur development in key parts of the country. But Serrano wonders if it\u2019s funding the kind of infrastructure that will bring about inclusive economic growth.,He pointed out that a majority of the infra budget is for road network services, not public transportation systems.,\u201cIf it\u2019s big infra, we want to see it in mass transit, in ports, because we are an archipelago so we want a development of the port system and then the train system. We don\u2019t want expansion of highways,\u201d said Serrano.,More highways create an incentive for car ownership which he said practically translates to \u201can indirect subsidy to the rich\u201d rather than the pro-poor public transit systems like trains and sea ports.,SWP also wanted to see more funds for light infrastructure: rural roads, electrification, and sanitation and water infrastructure.,Funds prone to abuse,While Duterte continues to sound the call against corruption, Serrano said one needs only to look at the 2017 budget to see windows of opportunity for abusive spending practices.,For instance, he criticized the \u201chighly discretionary\u201d ,intelligence and confidential funds, under the Office of the President, which posted a 400% increase compared to 2016.,Because of the sensitive nature of the funds, they can only be looked into by the Commission on Audit chairperson. But for Serrano, these funds can and should be explained after they are spent.,\u201cIn the pre-audit, maybe not, we can understand because that will compromise whatever plans they have. But after, there should be an accounting for it,\u201d he said.,Another red flag for Serrano is the supposed, pork barrel-like funds, for ARMM infrastructure projects that had been lodged in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).,The roughly P9-billion funds were questioned by Senator Panfilo Lacson to the point that come bicameral committee, members of the House of Representatives who pushed for the funds agreed to transfer the funds to the Commission on Higher Education for, free tuition, in state-run universities.,But SWP pointed out that, despite this move, DPWH was able to retain the P9 billion because of other additions to its budget. ,SWP shares ,Lacson\u2019s concern ,that this additional budget likely came from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (Calamity) Fund which experienced a large cut \u2013 ,from a proposed budget of P37.255 billion to a mere P15.755 billion in the signed 2017 budget law. That's a cut of P21.5 billion.,Serrano doesn\u2019t buy the House of Representatives' reasoning that just because projects are itemized means they are not prone to pork-like practices.,\u201cThis is probably all itemized, in that sense, it\u2019s not pork. But if they have a connection to the projects because they were the ones who proposed it and that\u2019s been pre-arranged with contractors, that\u2019s the thing worth watching,\u201d said Serrano.,With the budget allocated, citizens should be on the lookout for how government money is spent. Only the implementation of funded programs will show if the 2017 national budget helped fulfill President Duterte\u2019s promises to the people., \u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/159002-2017-national-budget-duterte-promises", "title": "A look at the 2017 budget: Will it help Duterte fulfill his promises?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/174344-warriors-star-curry-play-second-tier-golf,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156276-duterte-signs-2017-budget,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/146510-explainer-office-president-confidential-intelligence-funds"},

And for me, that is improper at best,\" said Nograles, who went to the press office at the House on Tuesday, May 2, after he was rumored to be in talks with the Impeach Leni Movement.,The group, composed of lawyers and bloggers who support President Rodrigo Duterte, is seeking lawmakers' endorsement of their impeachment complaint against Vice President Leni Robredo.,A Filipino citizen may initiate impeachment of a public official, but the complaint must be endorsed by a lawmaker for the document to be considered officially filed. (READ: ,FAST FACTS: How does impeachment work?,),In a press conference, the group's spokesperson and lawyer Bruce Rivera said a male lawmaker asked them to bring a copy of the impeachment complaint to his office so he may review it.

Whoever that lawmaker is, it surely is not me. I saw the front page of that said complaint bearing my name and the names of other individuals who I do not know,\" said Nograles.,He explained that Rivera and ,suspended lawyer, Trixie Cruz-Angeles left a copy of the impeachment complaint in his office on Tuesday without even asking to see him.,\"I do not know these people.

In two of the elder Nograles' 3 failed bids for Davao City mayor, he lost to a Duterte \u2013 first to Rodrigo and then to Rodrigo's daughter, Sara. ,But the Nograles family ,set aside local politics to support Duterte ,during the 2016 elections, which the latter won by a landslide.,Just a 'misunderstanding?',The PBA representative later showed reporters a copy of the first page of the draft impeachment complaint.,The document's complainant section reads: \"Rose Beatrix Cruz-Angeles, Antonio Contreras, Epimaco Densing III, G Ahmed G Paglinawan, Bruce Rivera, Tomas Berenguer, Through Rep Jericho Nograles, PBA Partylist.\",Apart from Nograles, the complainants listed are all members of the Impeach Leni Movement. , ,Sought for clarification, Rivera told Rappler there was a \"misunderstanding\" between the Impeach Leni Movement and Nograles' camp. He clarified the lawmaker his group is directly talking to is not Nograles either.,\"Ang ano kasi diyan, (What happened there is that), we were initially asked to talk to several congressmen. ,Ngayon, 'di naman namin alam sino mag-e-endorse so gumawa kami ng draft letters ,(We didn't know who will be endorsing so we made draft letters),\" said Rivera. ,Contrary to Nograles' statement, Rivera said they informed the lawmaker's camp that they would be giving him a copy of the complaint for his review.,\"Apparently nagka-misunderstanding\u2026 Hindi tama 'yung pagkaka-relay ng information\u2026 Dapat babasahin niya muna,\", said Rivera.,(Apparently there was a misunderstanding\u2026 The information was not relayed properly\u2026 He should just read it first.) ,\"Draft lang 'yan ,(That's just a draft).

{"author": "Lucille L. Sering", "date": "2014-03-29T06:31:56+0800", "content": "\nClimate changes may also increase the danger of war, because already scarce natural resources, including drinking water, will be under greater pressure    ,The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) this week declared the start of summer, and for most of us this is generally good news. It means the end of regular classes, a long vacation due to the Holy Week, among other \u201csunny\u201d things. In short, a much-needed break. The line from the song ,\u201c,Summer Breeze,\u201d, by Seals and Croft \u2013 \u201csummer breeze makes me feel fine\u201d \u2013 aptly sums up the general sentiment about the season. Even writing this article gave me a smile due to the prospect of not worrying about floods for at least two months. Then some reality check., ,I am here in Yokohama, Japan, to attend the 38th Session of the ,Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),. The IPCC is a scientific body under the auspices of the United Nations (UN). It reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical, and socio-economic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change. The IPCC is open to all member countries of the UN and World Meteorological Office (WMO). Governments participate in the review process and the plenary sessions, where main decisions about the IPCC work program are taken and reports are accepted, adopted, and approved.,The 38th session meeting started on March 25 and is scheduled to end on March 29. It is also the 10th Plenary of the IPCC Working Group 2, the group that produced the report that deals with impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability. It is part two of the 4-part assessment of the IPCC. It will supersede the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) that was published 8 years ago.,The Philippine Climate Change Commission (CCC) is the lead policy making body on climate change-related programs as enunciated under Republic Act 9729 or the Climate Change Act of 2009. As part of the CCC, I have the privilege to be the first to see the draft of the scientific summary for policy makers and the opportunity to intervene in the language of the draft.,For those following climate change issues, these reports are considered the \u201cbible\u201d of climate change. With the growing global concern on climate change, interest in the latest available science have also heightened. The work of the IPCC is considered the most pertinent benchmark for climate action. It has significant influence on the negotiations in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its previous work, the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), received the Nobel Prize in 2007. The IPCC shared the prize with Al Gore, former vice president of the United States of America. The Nobel Prize raised the integrity and level of confidence in the work of the IPCC as the foremost document on climate science. Thus, the release of the entire report is highly anticipated not only by the scientific community but also by governments and businesses with special interests.,By awarding the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 to the IPCC, and former US Vice President Al Gore Jr, the Norwegian Nobel Committee called special attention to their efforts to obtain and disseminate greater knowledge concerning man-made climate changes and the steps that need to be taken to counteract those changes.,According to the IPCC, there is a real danger that climate changes may also increase the danger of war and conflict, because they will place already scarce natural resources, not least drinking water, under greater pressure and put large population groups to flight from drought, flooding, and other extreme weather conditions.,For the Philippines, these ingredients of danger are already present. With an increasing population exposed to increasing intensity of typhoons during the last 5 years, even in areas not often visited by typhoons, the dangers are now becoming a reality. And we are only talking about typhoons. While it is true that most of the damages from natural disasters are water-related, we need to also understand the other extreme weather events, such as droughts. In the Philippines, drought events are associated with the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, whose frequency during the last decade has been increasing.,Unlike typhoons, whose strength can now be easily determined in terms of wind speed, rainfall, and pressure, droughts are difficult to ascertain. Even declaring an occurrence of a drought varies from region to region. A drought is generally taken to mean a situation of acute rainfall deficiency. Its potential impacts will be most apparent on water supply, especially for agriculture. El Ni\u00f1o events that brought significant damage in the agriculture sector occurred in the years 1972-73, 1982-83, 1986-87, 1997-98, 2002-2003, and 2010.,I initially struggled with the timing in raising this as a concern, especially after the signing of the Bangsamoro Peace Agreement. But being a Mindanaoan, I feel that the timing is right to take advantage of the enthusiasm of the prospect of real peace. Under the year 2020 scenarios of Pagasa, Mindanao will experience longer dry season starting from March to August.,The scenario is dimmer for year 2050. The provinces in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) will have the highest reduction of rainfall in terms of percentage from baseline. These scenarios are considered conservative because the ARMM is the least observed area in the Philippines in terms of weather and climate, not for lack of intention but mainly because of peace and order challenges.,Now that the promise of peace is about to be realized, we need to sustain it by addressing climate change, an issue considered by many as the greatest challenge of our time. Climate change may not have been mentioned under the agreement, but hopefully it will find its way in the law creating the Bangsamoro.,As I often say, climate change is not a disaster; it potentially can become one if we do not heed the warning offered by science. Being here in the IPCC meetings gives me the opportunity to see and appreciate the motivation behind the scientific report for policy makers. The report, despite being placed under scrutiny by government representatives, remains consistent with the overall finding that climate change is upon us. It enhances the need for urgent action from all corners of the world because no one will be exempted from the adverse impacts in a 4-degree temperature increase scenario.,A recent statement of the WMO, cited that \"many of the extreme events of 2013 were consistent with what we would expect as a result of human-induced climate change,\" with emphasis on the heavier precipitation, more intense heat, and more damage from storm surges and coastal flooding as a result of sea level rise \u2013 as Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) so tragically demonstrated in the Philippines. The WMO also pointed to data from Australia\u2019s drought, showing that the country's record heat last year would have been \"virtually impossible\" without human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.,With all these, should we be alarmed? Yes, we should. Being alarmed has its merits because it motivates you to do something to address it. Complacency, on the other hand, breeds mediocrity and inaction. Projections based on sound science are actually giving us time and the opportunity not to panic. This is the real value of these scientific reports. It should not be feared. Instead, it should be welcomed.,Government resources were strained in 2013 alone after the 25 typhoons, with significant damage from typhoons Labuyo, Santi, and Yolanda, and the major earthquake in Bohol. Our overall level of preparedness was exposed, its flaws highlighted.,This is why the Climate Change Commission is strongly pushing for planning around vulnerabilities \u2013 not only plans and programs by the government but also by the private sector. All plans and programs must incorporate climate and weather information as part of managing risks, or, for businesses, as part of maximizing yield.,In the next few days, the climate change Cabinet cluster will be presenting to the President the roadmap covering the second half of his administration. It is heavy on investments in science that will help the country plan around vulnerabilities, including conducting the first ever climate exposure database.,The climate exposure database now includes exposure to increase in temperature, especially in production areas. The database will guide technical agencies, especially the National Disaster Risk Management Council, to focus preparedness not only on typhoons but also on slow onset events like droughts. Equally important is that the database will be most useful to businesses that rely on agriculture in their supply chain.,As we enjoy summer, it makes time pass by so fast. The threat of El Ni\u00f1o for this year remains low and is not expected to happen this summer, but the threat remains nonetheless. According to Pagasa, rainy season is expected to start mid-May or start of June. President Aquino already made instructions to relevant agencies to prepare for the rainy season. Some academic institution made a proactive stance by moving the opening of the school year to August. Weather might not be the main reason for the change, but I have long supported this call. In the first place, making up for classes due to weather-related suspension is not part of the curriculum design.,As we move forward from last year, addressing climate change and disaster should be more proactive and not merely reactive. Understanding the dominant role of water in the climate system is crucial to identifying vulnerabilities to the increase in volume of water and also to the lack of it. While we know what is forthcoming on weather, preparedness means not just preparing to respond but, now more than ever, preparing to withstand. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/thought-leaders/54187-sering-preparedness-extreme-weather-events", "title": "Preparing to withstand other extreme weather events", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/earth-space/117360-record-el-nino-climate-change-drive-extreme-weather,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/167397-jennica-sanchez-eliminated-asias-next-top-model-season-5,http://www.rappler.com/nation/173701-civilian-wounded-stray-bullet-marawi-capitol"},

{"author": "Jane Bracher", "date": "2015-05-10T22:45:00+0800", "content": "\nNCR has been Palaro\u2019s champions in the last decade. They have yet to relinquish their hold of overall champion of the games since 2005    , ,TAGUM CITY, Philippines \u2013 Even winners must lose at some point.,And that\u2019s exactly what the Davao Region (Region XI) is hoping to achieve, hopefully in the near future, against long-time champions National Capital Region (NCR) at Palarong Pambansa, the country\u2019s largest multi-sporting event. ,But how do you take down a perennial champion that produces highly competitive athletes thanks to its enormous pool of resources? ,\u201cIt will require continuing reforms,\u201d Davao del Norte Governor Rodolfo del Rosario shared his insights to Rappler one dry afternoon in Tagum City, the host of this year\u2019s Palaro. ,Del Rosario explained how the private schools of Manila are always a step ahead, even against the private schools of provinces. ,\u201c,Itong Palarong Pambansa, it just occured to me, akala ko strictly public schools. Ngayon pala pati private schools kasama rito,,\u201d he said. (Palarong Pambansa, it just occured to me, is not strictly for public schools. Now we have private schools participating already.),\u201cAnd who has the best private schools in the country? ,Hindi ba nasa, NCR (Is it not NCR)? Ateneo, La Salle, UP, Mapua, UST. They\u2019re participating in the games. ,\u201cHere in the provinces, we have private schools here but we don\u2019t have the kinds of private schools they have there. They really tap their athletes and scout. Before you know it they\u2019re already in the private schools with scholarships.\u201d,NCR has been Palaro\u2019s champions in the last decade. They have not relinquished their hold of overall champion of the games since 2005. And 2015 is no different as NCR emerged triumphant with 98 gold, 67 silver and 71 bronze medals.,Calabarzon was once again a far second with a 51-41-49 medal haul, while Western Visayas came in at third with 42-48-41. ,Usurping the region where the country\u2019s capital is located has been close to impossible with NCR clobbering its competition by an average of 106.3 medals since 2012.,Last year, while the disparity in total medal count was significantly lower than previous years \u2013 as it decreased to 87 in 2014 from 110 in 2013 and 122 in 2012 \u2013 NCR still proved its dominance with its gold medal haul. They ran away with the overall championship with 107 golds as opposed to just 38 and 32 by podium finishers Calabarzon and Western Visayas, respectively. ,Over the last decade, the remaining two slots at the podium was contested between Western Visayas and Calabarzon, though Central Visayas and Northern Mindanao ousted Calabarzon for third place in 2013 by virtue of point system and medal tally, respectively. Palaro determines the overall champion either by point system or medal tally and it varies each year.,Del Rosario\u2019s Davao region, which finished 8th last year, slipped to 9th place this year despite \u201chomecourt\u201d advantage with 13 golds, 23 silvers and 30 bronzes. ,Athlete piracy,Most coaches, media and watchers attribute NCR\u2019s dominance to athlete \u201cpiracy\u201d \u2013 something they say is made possible by the region\u2019s wealthy resources.,\u201c,Sabi nga namin, kung hindi lang gagawin ng NCR yung pamimirata ng athletes mas malakas kami. Totoo yan,,\u201d said Pacita Lungcay, Education Program Supervisor for the Department of Education in Calabarzon, who did not drop any athlete names. \u201c,Kasi katulad last year yung ilang kalaban namin sa swimming ay mga athletes namin before na na-pirate ng NCR,.\u201d ,(We always say that if only NCR did not pirate athletes, we\u2019re stronger. It\u2019s true. Like last year some of the athletes we competed against in swimming were those pirated by NCR.),Recruiting athletes from provinces has long been convention in Philippine sports. For instance, scouts from Manila make the effort to attend the Palaro, among other local sporting events, to search for outstanding athletes whom they offer scholarships and, in some cases, alleged additional perks and allowances.,The lure of a full ride to college along with many other opportunities is hard to ignore for most young athletes who hail from impoverished to average backgrounds. They simply want a chance for a better life, and if it's something these scouts from NCR can provide them, they can't be blamed for jumping ship.,Veteran journalists who have covered Palarong Pambansa for years affirm recruitment is a significant factor that contributes to the continued competitive gap between NCR and the rest of the regions.,\u201c,Ngayon, ang palagi namin sinasabi is we will play as a team. Solid tayo, (Now, we just tell ourselves that we will play as a team. We\u2019re a solid unit),\u201d said Lungcay. ,Del Rosario himself regressed and admitted NCR is too huge a force to reckon with.,\u201cWe cannot compete with the people in Manila because they have a lot of resources. ,Hindi naman pwede swelduhan yung mga athletes namin, (We can\u2019t give salaries to our athletes).\u201d,Del Rosario, however, also presents a different yet important perspective when it comes to the so-called athlete piracy.,\u201c,Ganoon din naman yun, (It\u2019s the same), if they end up in private schools then the better,\u201d he said, adding that this practice does not make beating NCR a hopeless dream.,\u201cThat\u2019s an opportunity for them (athletes) and they will build up their abilities. ,Pag nagkaroon ng Palaro and makitang magaling ka, ma-tap ka nila ,(If there is a Palaro and they see you\u2019re good, and they tap you), they will give you all the benefits you want. It\u2019s an advantage and it\u2019s a good thing to happen.\u201d,The NCR Girls' Volleyball team takes down home team Davao Region to reclaim the volleyball championship. Photo by Christine Cudis/Rappler  ,Promoting parity,With NCR expected to win year in and year out as if by default, parity is practically extinguished at Palarong Pambansa. Like a giant without a weakness fighting against much smaller foes, nobody has yet to upset the accustomed dominance of NCR. But Calabarzon is not giving up. ,\u201c,Of course lahat naman ang target is makuha yung overall champion, kaya lang yung case sa halos lahat ng regions, parang hindi siya talaga ganoon kadali,,\u201d said Lungcay. \u201c,Pero ginagawa naman namin lahat ng magagawa namin para at least makahabol kami,.\u201d,(Of course everyone\u2019s goal is to become overall champion, but in the cases of the regions, it\u2019s never easy. But we are doing everything we can to match up.),The Department of Education (DepEd), the organizer of the annual games, recognizes the need for parity among regions, which led to putting in place a point system two years ago on top of the regular medal system. ,The point system aims to put more value on every medal earned and give other regions a shot at earning a podium finish even if they don\u2019t garner the most golds.,This year\u2019s Palaro overall champion, however, was determined by medal tally. And even if a region who makes more points off of silver medals than another region that wins a few golds, the fact remains that NCR still tops everybody else with its high volume of golds medals.,Some of the media assess that NCR\u2019s supremacy is, in large part, a result of their competitiveness in medal-rich sports, which is the key to winning multi-sporting events. Such sports include swimming, athletics and gymnastics. This year, NCR collected 32 of its 98 total golds from swimming.,In addition to the point system, DepEd Assistant Secretary Tonisito Umali shared plans for a program called \u201cOne Child, One Sport,\u201d which aims to ensure each child can play and is knowledgeable of at least one sport.,\u201c,Sa pakikipagugnayan ng LGU, hihikayatin natin na ang bawat bata ay makakapaglaro at magiging mahusay sa iisang palakasan lang,,\u201d Umali said in a press briefing at the games. \u201c,Pag sinabing One Child, One Sport, hilig niya ito. Alam niya yung storya ng sport,.\u201d,(In coordination with the LGU, we will encourage every child to play and become well-versed in one sport. When we say One Child, One sport, we mean the child truly loves one sport. He or she knows the history of that sport.) ,That is in addition to including sports as one of the tracks in the K to 12 curriculum.,\u201cWe believe that a child with at least one sport in his mind will go a great way, not only in being a better person in terms of physical health, but also in terms of discipline etc.,\u201d Umali added.,Meanwhile, some regions are taking matters into their own hands.,No longer wanting to remain a perennial bridesmaid, Calabarzon hopes its efforts to provide its homegrown athletes with sufficient training facilities as well as international exposure will yield Palaro rewards.,For next year, Calabarzon plans on putting more emphasis and focus on some of their weaker sports such as boxing and archery.,\u201c,Siguro may mga events pa kami na kailangan pa namin matutukan,,\u201d Lungcay said when asked what the region should do for a better showing next year. \u201c,Yun yung mga events na hindi nakakatulong sa amin na umangat,.,\u201d ,(There are still some events that we need to focus and improve on. Those events that are not helping us rise up.),Aside from Calabarzon, the Davao region is also gearing up for a competitive future with its grassroots sports development program, which involves developing swimmers out of children living in coastal areas and runners out of children living in the highlands. (,WATCH: Floating pool future of PH swimming,),The lack of parity at Palaro reflects the Philippines\u2019 economical and societal status, where people flock to the capital in the hope of capitalizing on supposedly better opportunities. If there were equal opportunities across all regions, most would not feel the need to relocate and abandon their natural way of life. ,The same parity is required in producing competitive athletes to represent the country internationally. Ideally, grassroots programs should be standard, instead of a once in a blue moon occurence. Equal opportunities can yield the best athletes from every part of the Philippines, while monopolizing limits what the nation can achieve in sports.,At Palaro, NCR and its resources remain too much to overcome, for now. But if other regions institutionalize a stable system for sports development, change will come soon enough. ,\u2013 with reports from Michael Jugado/Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/specials/palarong-pambansa/2015/92785-what-will-it-take-beat-ncr-palaro", "title": "What will it take to eventually beat NCR at Palaro?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/sports/specials/palarong-pambansa/2015/92625-floating-pool-future-philippine-swimming"},

According to Dela Rosa, the SAF troopers will \u201cconduct tactical offensives against police scalawags.\u201d,Senior Superintendent Chiquito Malayo, former deputy chief of the PNP\u2019s Firearms and Explosives Office, will be its head. Malayo was the police chief of Zamboanga City when rogue Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters tried to seize the city.,The newly-created task force will be occupying the building that was once the Anti-Illegal Drugs Group (AIDG), which has since been ordered ,dismantled, by President Rodrigo Duterte himself.,Aside from the SAF, the task force will tap counter-intelligence operations from the PNP Intelligence GRoup and investigators from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group.,The creation of the task force comes at a rather trying time for the PNP.,Nearly 8 months into a popular but controversial war on drugs, Duterte ,ordered a stop, to all police anti-illegal drugs operations. Although the PNP has been hounded by allegations of abuse in the name of the drugs war, the tipping point seemed to have been the ,murder, ,of Korean national, Jee Ick Joo, allegedly by cops and National Bureau of Investigation operatives.,Police allegedly claimed they were conducting an anti-illegal drugs operation when Jee was taken from his home in Angeles City. He was killed the same day in front of the AIDG headquarters in Camp Crame.,The deadline of the task force\u2019s \u201cinternal cleansing\u201d efforts isn\u2019t quite clear just yet. In a speech, Dela Rosa said that with the PNP\u2019s cooperation, it might take as short as 1 month. Speaking to reporters a few days later, Dela Rosa said he wanted Malayo to get the job done before he retired in January 2018.,One thing\u2019s for sure, though. Malayo and his men and women will have a tough job ahead of them \u2013 \u201ccleansing\u201d the PNP of its black sheep at a time when many are beginning to doubt its mandate \u201cto protect and to serve.\u201d \u2013 ,Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/160544-task-force-police-scalawags-what-we-know", "title": "Task force vs police scalawags: What we know so far", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130937-zamboanga-del-norte-jalosjos-assassination-try,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/174317-rumors-pacquiao-decline-greatly-exaggerated,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159982-pnp-counter-intel-task-force-scalawag-cops,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159931-pnp-dela-rosa-stop-drug-operations-focus-cleansing"},

It would have made it illegal for DMCI to construct Torre de Manila to a height that would impair the sightline of the Rizal Monument., ,But a month later, then-Manila mayor Lim vetoed the ordinance \"for being ultra vires,\" a term which means that the act was beyond the legal power of the city council.,This was done while the council was on recess, and local officials were in the thick of the electoral campaign season.,In November, under the term of current Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada, the city council ,suspended the building permit, for Torre de Manila to allow for a roundtable discussion between DMCI and groups opposing the project.,FIGHTING FOR RIZAL.

Senator ,Pia Cayetano questioned DMCI, on its assumptions of \u201cgood faith\u201d in constructing the high-rise despite knowing the zoning limitations in the area. DMCI explained that it considered the permits obtained from the city government good enough to proceed with construction. ,On September 12, the Knights of Rizal \u2013 a group created in honor of the national hero \u2013 filed a ,petition before the Supreme Court,, seeking the demolition of the condominium. ,The group said the high-rise building threatens to ruin the \"visual dominance\" of the monument of the national hero.,The petitioner also said the building qualifies as a \"nuisance\", and claimed that DMCI built the building in bad faith.,Named respondents in the petition were DMCI, the city of Manila, and government respondents National Museum, National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).,The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) represents the government respondents., ,2015,January,In January, the NCCA issued a cease and desist order (CDO) against Torre de Manila because it \u201cdestroys or significantly alters\u201d the view of the Rizal Monument. ,The NCCA cited the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009, saying that the Rizal National Monument, Rizal Fountain, Rizal Park, and the Execution Site are \u201ccultural property characterized as built heritage.\u201d,DMCI, however, said ,only the Supreme Court, can stop construction. ,June,In June, the SC issued a temporary restraining order ,stopping the construction, of Torre de Manila. It also set dates for oral arguments on the petition filed by the Knights of Rizal.,Also in June, ,Estrada openly blamed Lim, for signing the permits for the controversial high-rise. Lim earlier accused Estrada of extorting money from DMCI for building permits.

Should constitutional provisions on heritage conversation be interpreted in a different way? Did Manila city officials follow the rule of law when it allowed DMCI to construct the building? Does NHCP have the legal obligation to stop the construction of Torre de Manila?,In July, the Solicitor General ,changed his stand on the case,, reversing his earlier position that there was no legal basis for the NHCP to stop the construction of the building because Torre sits on private property \u201cway beyond the protected buffer zone of the Rizal Monument and the Rizal Park.\u201d ,Under the law, the NHCP can issue a CDO when the \u201cphysical integrity\u201d of a cultural artifact is threatened.,Solicitor General Florin Hilbay\u2019s new position was that Torre de Manila is illegal and should be removed because it violates constitutional provisions on the preservation of cultural artifacts.,He argued that in the case of the Rizal Monument, its \u201cphysical integrity\u201d necessarily includes its sightline.,The ,NHCP slammed Hilbay, for reversing his position. ,In August, the Solicitor General ,drops the NHCP as its client, owing to differences in opinion on the case.,On September 1, the Court held the ,6th and last hearing, on the Torre de Manila petition.,In a 46-page memorandum dated September 21, the Solicitor General asked the SC to ,order DMCI to demolish Torre de Manila, at its own expense. ,The Solicitor General also said the NHCP ,\"acted outside of its jurisdiction\" by going against its mandate when it said that there was no legal justification to stop the construction of the building. ,\u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/104667-torre-de-manila-dmci-supreme-court-timeline", "title": "TIMELINE: The Torre de Manila case", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/167397-jennica-sanchez-eliminated-asias-next-top-model-season-5,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/nation/102980-torre-de-manila-supreme-court-jardeleza,http://www.rappler.com/nation/43012-nhcp-backs-off-torre-de-manila-issue"},

(READ: ,What's in the proposed 2017 national budget?,),The allotment for confidential and intelligence funds increased by 400%, from only P250 million ($5.2 million) in 2016 to a proposed P1.25 billion ($26.1 million) for 2017.,With the Duterte administration's ongoing war against illegal drugs, how will these funds come into play?,Lump-sum funds,Both are lump-sum funds allocated every year to national and local government executives.,Confidential funds (CF) are used for \"surveillance activities in civilian government agencies that are intended to support the mandate or operations of the said agency.\",Meanwhile, intelligence funds (IF) are for \"intelligence information-gathering activities of uniformed and military personnel and [of] intelligence practitioners that have direct impact (on) national security.\",Both definitions are contained in ,Joint Circular No. 2015-01, of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of National Defense (DND), the Commission on Audit (COA), and the Governance Commission for government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCC).,What data says,In previous years, CF and IF allocations under the OP never went beyond P1 billion.,The biggest allotment in the last 10 years was in 2010, when P651 million was set aside for confidential and intelligence expenses. Of the amount, P500 million was allotted to the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, P1 million to the National Telecommunications Commission, and the remaining P150 million to the OP itself as part of its expenses for general management and supervision.,In the last 4 years of the administration of then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the combined CF and IF budget was around P650 million. Under former president Benigno Aquino III, the budget for CF and IF was constantly set at P500 million, except for 2011, when it was at P400 million.,For 2017, however, the combined CF and IF allotment is only 12.48% of the total OP budget, which is lower by at least 2.8 percentage points compared to previous years.,In an email to Rappler, the DBM Media Office said that these confidential and intelligence funds would be used \"mainly for President Rodrigo R. Duterte\u2019s war against drugs, criminality and corruption.\",\"The increased efforts of the President naturally requires an increase in resources,\" it added, with a comment that in the past, the annual budget for these funds \"was disbursed without any visible results.\",The DBM also said that the CF and IF are subject to review by the Commission on Audit.,For her part, former COA chief Grace Pulido-Tan said that auditors would rely on the reports and documents that the agencies, including the OP, submit.,Because of the nature of these funds, details of where they actually go may not be fully disclosed to the public. (WATCH: ,Confidential, intel funds difficult to audit \u2013 ex-COA chair,),Guidelines,Nonetheless, Joint Circular No. 2015-01 provides for guidelines regarding the use of these funds.,According to the said circular, confidential funds can only be used for the following:,Meanwhile, intelligence funds can be used only by uniformed, military personnel and intelligence practitioners in these cases:,The CF and IF cannot be used to pay salaries and other benefits, representation or consultancy fees, or for the construction/acquisition of buildings or houses.,The disbursement or release of these funds must be supported by documentary evidence of payment and a certification (signed under oath) of the officer accountable for these funds. The documentation for CF and IF expenses would then be handled separately and differently by COA personnel for security reasons.,Allocation, release,Allocations of these funds should be accompanied by a Physical and Financial Plan where the amounts for each related program or activity are indicated.,The CF and IF of national agencies are contained in the national budget passed by Congress. Their use of CF is subject to approval by the concerned Cabinet secretary or head of agency. But the release of intelligence funds must be approved first by the President.,Local goverment units (LGU) that have peace and order as a primary concern are also entitled to have confidential funds, but not intelligence funds. The CF's release and use should be approved by two-thirds of the LGU's peace and order council. Additional CF would have to be approved by the DILG.,GOCCs may likewise have confidential funds upon clearance with the Governance Commission, but their release and use are subject to approval by the President.,Quarterly report,The CF expenses should be contained in a quarterly accomplishment report. Security procedures to protect classified information would have to be observed.,National agencies must report to the President, both leaders of Congress, and to the Cabinet secretary concerned. Meanwhile, LGUs report to the DILG.,GOCCs report their CF expenditures to the President (through the Governance Commission) and to both leaders of Congress.,National agencies that spent intelligence funds would also have to report quarterly to the President. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,* $1 = P47.83, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/146510-explainer-office-president-confidential-intelligence-funds", "title": "EXPLAINER: Office of the President's confidential, intel funds", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/156174-duterte-fentanyl-madness-de-lima,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159883-government-stop-project-noah-march-2017-lack-funds,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/156327-two-pronged-flight-attendant-cheating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/budget-watch/145988-proposed-2017-national-budget,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/rich-media/146494-confidential-intelligence-funds-audit-process-coa-chair"},

He added that the two lawyers also sent him two billing statements for \"consultants,\" amounting to P45,000.,This prompted Dongga-as to file a complaint with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP)'s Committee on Bar Discipline.,According to the SC, Angeles denied being remiss in her duties, citing the complainant's failure to provide the address of his estranged wife and to provide sufficient evidence as the cause of the delay in filing the petition.,She also said that Paler was tasked to draft and finalize the petition.,Paler had moved to dismiss the case, arguing that it was filed to avoid payment of attorney's fees.,The IBP's investigating committee found the two administratively liable and recommended their 4-month suspension, while the IBP Board of Governors recommended a two-year suspension.,The SC adopted the IBP's findings, but raised the penalty to a 3-year suspension.,Aside from the suspension, the SC also ordered the respondents to return the P350,000 to Dongga-as within 90 days from the finality of the decision.,In a Facebook post, Angeles said she accepted the SC decision.,\"I will not argue the merits of my case, though I strongly believe I was not accorded due process. However, I am an officer of the court and subject to its disciplines. I am also subject to the legal system. And I believe in that system.

temperature and the surface area affected    , ,PARIS, France \u2013 Deadly extreme weather on at least five continents is driven in large part by a record-breaking El Nino, but climate change is a likely booster too, experts said Monday, December 28.,The 2015-16 El Nino, they added, is the strongest ever measured.,\"It is probably the most powerful in the last 100 years,\" said Jerome Lecou, a climate expert at the French weather service Meteo France, noting that accurate measurements have only existed since the mid-20th century.,Flooding and mudslides unleashed by torrential rains have killed at least 10 people and driven more than 150,000 from their homes in Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay in recent days.,In central and southwestern United States -- where temperatures in Texas are forecast to drop from a balmy 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit) Saturday to zero (32 F) on Monday \u2013 clashing weather fronts have given rise to snow-packed blizzards, freezing rain and a spate of tornadoes that have claimed at least 43 lives.,Across the Pacific, meanwhile, wildfires in Australia fanned by high temperatures and super-dry conditions have engulfed more than 100 homes outside Melbourne, with hundreds more threatened.,Across south and southeast Asia, monsoon rains essential for life-sustaining crops have been limited, while drought in eastern Africa means millions will require food aid, especially in Ethiopia, according to Oxfam.,\"The role of El Nino on much of what we are seeing around the planet is obvious,\" said Herve Le Treut, a climate scientist and director of the Pierre-Simon Laplace Institute, which is a federation of French research centres.,El Ninos, which emerge every 4 to 7 years on average and run from October through January, are triggered by a shift in trade winds across the Pacific around the equator.,Multiplier effect,Warmer surface water that normally accumulates in the eastern Pacific moves to the west, leading to heavier rainfall along the west coast of the Americas and drier-than-usual conditions in Australasia and southeast Asia.,This year's El Nino is the most powerful ever measured, surpassing the one in 1997-98, both in terms of ocean surface temperature -- up by more than 3C (5.4F) -- and the surface area affected, said Lecou.,As was true in 1998, this year's super El Nino will have contributed to making 2015 the warmest on record, worldwide. ,But the reverse may also be true, with climate change boosting the power of cyclical El Nino events.,\"If you add the background global warming to natural weather phenomena, there's a tendency to break records left and right,\" Le Treut told Agence France-Presse.,\"This naturally occurring El Nino and human-induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways which we have never before experienced,\" Michel Jarraud, head of the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, noted last month.,But the multiplier effect of climate change on extreme weather events -- while predicted by climate models -- is very difficult to establish on a case-by-case basis, scientists caution.  ,The tornadoes, for example, that ripped across populated stretches of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolis in Texas cannot be directly linked to global warming, even if generally warmer conditions may favour their occurence. ,Likewise the heavy rains and flooding that have devastated parts of northern England, where the government dispatched hundreds of soldiers for emergency assistance.,\"Milder winters favour rainfall, such as what we are seeing in England,\" said French researcher Jean Jouzel, former vice chair of the UN\u2019s top panel of climate scientists.,But such extremes could still fall within the boundaries of natural cycles, independent of climate change, he added.,This year's El Nino is credited with the largest number \u2013 9, in total \u2013 of major Pacific hurricanes in a single season, along with the single most powerful hurricane ever recorded. ,Patricia, packing 320-kilometer (200-mile) per hour winds, was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it struck Mexico in October. ,\u2013 Marlowe Hood,

Cagangohan, a barangay in Panabo City, is the brainchild of DavNor swim coach Mustari Raji and was funded by the local government in line with Davao del Norte Governor Rodolfo del Rosario\u2019s \u201cUgmad Komunidad\u201d program, which includes sports., ,The pool is standard Olympic size and is roughly 300 meters from shore. It is best utilized during high tide, when the water rises and makes the pool 6-feet deep. Compared to a controlled fresh water pool, the biggest difference is swimmers will have to deal with the sea\u2019s current and waves. The theory is swimmers trained here are stronger and more resistant than those trained in a controlled pool.,The floating pool is relatively inexpensive to build as it costs around Php 400,000 and is made of readily available materials such as nylon, coconut tree trunk, plastic barrels and styrofoam. It took about a month to construct.,Visitors can see it up close using either a makeshift barge which the local kids pull from shore, or a motorboat.,Raji, the primary trainer at the floating pool, started teaching local children the basics of swimming just a week before Palaro \u2014 the country's largest annual multi-sporting event \u2014 which takes place in neighboring Tagum City.,A former national team swimmer in the 1970s, Raji used the sport to earn a scholarship and finish college. It is his firm hope that impoverished children living along the coast can find a way out through swimming, just like he once did.,\u201cMaraming mahirap sa coastal areas, kasi galing ako sa mahirap na pamilya,,\" said the coach who hailed from Jolo. (There are plenty of poor people in coastal areas, and I came from a poor family as well.),He sees a great disconnect in Philippine sports, which he says fails to notice its many talented athletes from small towns.,DavNor\u2019s entire sports development program is built on the concept of capitalizing on natural strengths. It is plucking potential competitors from their natural habitats and steering them in the competitive direction.,The floating pool project taps swimmers from coastal areas.,\u201cWe want to give them the opportunity because they are better in swimming because they are fishermen and the children are playing in the shoreline,\u201d Del Rosario told Rappler.,\u201c,Palangoy langoy lang sila doon, (They just swim there) without knowing that their resistance is better than the ones who learn in Olympic swimming pools.\u201d,FUTURE. A young swimming-trainee gets ready to dive to the floating swimming pool. Photo by Franz Lopez/Rappler ,This initiative is not the only one of its kind in DavNor.,\u201cTalaingod, one of my municipalities here, is in the high land,\u201d Del Rosario shared a similar project involving runners.,\u201cThe population there is mostly Lumads and so, since the terrain is elevated, and yung dinadaanan nila (the road they pass through) are rolling areas, the children grew up going from one place to another using just the trails.\u201d,Like swimming, this program reaches out to young ones who inherently possess the skills to excell in a specific sport because of their natural way of life.,\u201cThe children are trained to experience rough terrain so their resistance is more than the ones living in low lands. Doon namin dine-develop yung mga runners namin (That's where we develop our runners),\u201d Rodolfo explained. \u201cYou put them on a flat running terrain like the ones here, they will outrun everyone.\u201d,For the poor, for the future,Maryniel Bacus, 13, jumped at the opportunity to secure her future upon learning of the opportunities swimming can bring.,\",Naisipan ko naman na oo nga, marunong naman ako lumangoy. Subukan ko kaya sumali,,\" explained the vivacious 2nd year high schooler.,\",Kasi baka makatulong sa pamilya ko, mahirap lang kasi kami. Sabi kasi may scholarship daw so hindi na magastos sa pag-aral.,\",(I thought that yes, I know how to swim. So I though I should join. It might help my family since we're poor. They told me there could be a scholarship so I won't have to pay for school.),Dave Verallo, 14 and whose mother works in Malaysia to provide him with a better life, is likewise in it for the future.,\",Sumali ako rito kasi sabi nila may libreng scholarship,,\" said Verallo, whose father works at the fish cages. \",Pag nakuha ako hindi na gagastos yung parents ko. Para hindi na kami maghirap.,\",(I joined because of the scholarship. If I get it my parents won't have to pay for anything. So we won't have a hard life.),Bacus and Varello are the primary beneficiaries of the grassroots program. They train once every day either in the morning or afternoon, depending on the tide, for a chance to get their heads above water in life.,The bigger picture, Raji said, is that swimming can prevent lives from going to waste. In the process, he hopes to produce the next generation of legendary Filipino athletes.,\",Ang objective, para sa mahihirap na bata, (The objective is that it's for the poor children),\" Raji said, adding that he already received information about a potential new location for a second floating swimming pool.,That location will be inland, however, and without waves.,For now, the initiative is commendable. The boldness is admirable. And the vision is sound.,So much so that other provinces are already seeking to replicate DavNor\u2019s floating swimming pool. Among them are Cagayan Valley and ARMM (Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao).,But as with anything else, the beginning is the easy part.,All eyes will be on DavNor, watching closely if they can sustain their grassroots sports initiatives and eventually take it to the next level. Only time can tell what the floating swimming pool can truly do for Philippine sports.,And it is up to DavNor to see their plans through.,\"That\u2019s my aspiration. I want to leave a legacy for our young people here,\" said Del Rosario.,\"It\u2019s really all up to them (kids) if they want to succeed in life. That\u2019s our role, give them the opportunities and let them take advantage of it if they want. But it\u2019s not only leaving it up to them.

In comparison our ASEAN neighbors Malaysia Thailand and Singapore have more schools in the list topped by the National University of Singapore. READ xa012 ASEAN schools in top 100 of Asian university rankings But one is better than nothing. In another major international rankings xa0Thomson Reuters Times Higher Education THE Asia University Rankings 2015 none of the 4 Philippine schools made it to the top 100. Only 4 ASEAN schools made it to the list National University of Singapore Singapore Nanyang Technological University Singapore King Mongkut s University of Technology Thonburi Thailand Mahidol University Thailand QS gives more weight on academic reputation while THE Asia University Rankings focuses on research an area that top Philippine universities are embarrassed about.Comparison will be inevitable in a post ASEAN integration era and this makes rankings all the more crucial for Philippine schools. But according to an ASEAN education expert at this point the rankings game is a perception game for the Philippines. Rankings gap Perceptions are real in their consequences. They have consequences for the way your people are treated because they become vulnerable to condescension Cynthia Bautista one of the commissioners from the Commission on Higher Education CHEd told Rappler.Take the case of UP the country s premier state university. It dropped from 63rd to 70th in the 2015 QS Asian rankings but the university is not the least bit worried not when it remains the top university in the country. Bumaba e anong magagawa natin It went down so what can we do UP vice president for public affairs Prospero de Vera said when asked about the drop in rankings.This is the same university that attributed improved rankings in 2014 to its pursuit of internationalization. xa0Now that it went down 7 notches de Vera pointed out there are indicators in the rankings where UP is naturally disadvantaged. More importantly UP s priority he said is to serve Filipinos.While that is true its own charter also mandates UP to become a regional and global university. But in the ASEAN region alone the rankings gap is already huge between UP and the top universities in Singapore Malaysia and Thailand. Collaboration or competition xa0But years ago Malaysia and Thailand used to be the Philippines equals in education according to Bautista who also chairs the regional task force on the ASEAN Qualifications Reference Framework.Today the difference is glaring. Only one public school from the Philippines made it to the 2015 QS University Rankings for Asia compared to 11 public institutions from Thailand and 14 from Malaysia. xa0Bautista said the Philippines is playing catch up in education a bit too late compared to other ASEAN nations that have started their cramming over a decade ago. ASEAN integration is pushing us to cram. What are we cramming We re cramming the education paradigm shift to learner centered education... We re cramming K to 12... We re cramming all of the changes that have to be done in connection with the paradigm shift the commissioner said.Fortunately the mood among ASEAN schools is still friendly at this early stage of the integration de Vera said as countries try to help each other develop.But competition is just around the corner. Soon enough once investments move across countries then you will see the competitiveness he added. xa0 xa0This is why for Bautista the Philippines has to be globally competitive sooner rather than later. The ASEAN way is collaboration rather than competition but the context we re operating in is also of competitive context. So we also have to be globally competitive. We also have to see ourselves as competing even while we re collaborative . You can collaborate more meaningfully and give of yourself if you re also developed Bautista explained.Balancing actAlthough UP admits rankings affects its reputation the university still looks at the numbers more as a guide than a driving force in its decision making. xa0 READ xa08 ways PH higher education can prepare for ASEAN 2015 It alerts us to benchmark what we re doing with the universities in the region especially in the ASEAN. That s the advantage because you see what the other universities are doing and it guides the position of UP in discussions de Vera said.Even at the national level while the country is trying to rank support for HEIs is not rankings driven. We re not yet supporting in a large scale like China and India not the kind of programs they already have although we are supporting through Centers of Excellence and helping them develop Bautista said.Because rankings are supposedly indicators of the quality of an institution the Philippines can t afford to ignore the numbers or negative perceptions of its higher education will persist. xa0 Kulang ka sa 12 years they think low quailty. Di ka nagrarank they think low quality. So the dilemma is you know in substance that s not necessarily the case that you don t rank doesn t mean your quality is poor . Dapat may consciousness tayo ng handling perceptions she added. If you have less than 12 years they think low quality. If you don t rank they think low quality. So the dilemma is you know in substance that s not necessarily the case that you don t rank doesn t mean your quality is poor . We must have a consciousness of handling perceptions. But in a landscape where other ASEAN countries already have big dreams for their higher education sector Malaysia for example wants to become an education hub in the region Bautista said the Philippines has to first focus on implementing reforms that are long overdue.It s a balancing act between playing the perception game well and pursuing quality in higher education. xa0After all as de Vera also noted schools with better quality of education will be the winners once ASEAN integrates.

Family and friends only had good words for 22-year-old Rowena Tiamson. Photo from Justice for Rowena facebook page ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Rowena Tiamson was supposed to graduate from college this coming October. But on July 19, she was deprived of the chance to march up the stage and get her diploma.,The 22-year-old was found lifeless in Barangay Parian in Manaoag, Pangasinan, with her hands tied and face covered. Around her neck was a cardboard sign with the all-too-familiar phrase \u201c,Huwag tularan, ,pusher (Don\u2019t emulate me. I\u2019m a pusher.)\u201d,Family and friends insist that Rowena was not in any way involved with illegal drugs. Tagging her as such is very unfair, they said.,According to her mother, Tere Tiamson, the last time she saw Rowena was when she asked for permission to go to school to fix school requirements. ,\u201c,Nagpaalam siya na may aayusin sa eskuwela kasi nga graduating,,\u201d she told Rappler. \u201c,Hindi ko naman alam na iyon na iyong huling beses na makikita ko ang anak ko,.\u201d,(She asked permission to fix school requirements because she\u2019s graduating. I didn\u2019t know that was going to be the last time I would ever see my daughter.),Police data also \u201ccleared\u201d her name. According to the Pangasinan Provincial Police, Rowena was not part of the list of drug personalities which includes 4,755 individuals from 1,704 drug-affected barangays in the province.,Rowena's dreams,There is no truth to what was written on the cardboard, her family and friends firmly claimed. Rowena did not fit the profile of a drug user, more so a drug pusher. ,Far from what the killers thought of her, the 5th of 6 children of a fruit vendor was a picture of a responsible and loving individual. Everyone only had good things to say about her: kind, selfless, obedient, pure.,\u201c,Kahit sino pa po ang tanungin ninyo dito sa lugar namin, mapapatunay nila na sinungaling ang nasa cardboard at hindi totoo na drug pusher ang anak ko,,\u201d Tere said. \u201c,Napakabait na bata niyan, palaging naglalambing, palaging tumutulong,.\u201d,(If you ask anyone in our area, they can prove that what's written on the cardboard isn't true and my daughter was not a drug pusher. She was very kind, very gentle, and very helpful.),Contrary to what was on the cardboard, Rowena was too busy finishing her final semester as a Mass Communication student at Colegio de Dagupan to be peddling illegal drugs. ,When she wasn't studying, she would be belting out the latest hits in local variety shows or singing hymns in her church. Tributes by many of her friends on Facebook, in fact, included ,videos, of her performing. ,When she wasn't in church or in school, Tere said her daughter would just be at home doing chores or taking care of her nephews and nieces. ,Rowena went through her daily life with no signs of slowing down just so she could achieve her dreams.,One of Rowena\u2019s dreams, abruptly snatched from her by unidentified suspects, was to buy a house for her family. She ultimately wanted her mother to live a comfortable life.,\u201c,Sabi niya bibilhan niya kami ng bahay para maayos na kami,,\u201d Tere said. \u201c,Magtatrabaho daw siyang maigi para hindi na ako magbenta palagi ng prutas, para hindi na ako gumising nang maaga para lang bumiyahe papuntang palengke,.\u201d,(She told me she will buy us a house so we\u2019ll be okay. She said she\u2019ll work hard so I won\u2019t have to sell fruits anymore and not wake up very early to travel to the market.),Rowena did not deserve the bullets that took away her life and her dreams, her mother insisted. She did not deserve her untimely death, especially being mistaken for a drug pusher, she said. ,\u201c,Napakasakit po na kukunin na lang ang anak ko na ganyan basta-basta,\u201d ,she said. \u201c,Ang dami pa niya pangarap, sobra,.\u201d,(It is so painful that she was taken from us just like that. She had a lot of dreams.),Those close to her cannot help but ask, although in vain: Why would someone mistake a consistent honor student and church choir member for a drug pusher?,She was smart, she was talented, and she was not supposed to be part of the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of the intense war against drugs in the Philippines.,Justice for Rowena,The people responsible for the death of Rowena still remain unidentified. Many can only point to vigilante groups responsible for the summary killings happening across the country. ,In fact, on the day his body was found, 20-year-old Oman Manaois was gunned down by unidentified men in Dagupan City. (READ: ,Drug user? No, Oman was a good son,),Like Rowena, Oman was supposed to graduate in October. Like Rowena, bullets also took away that opportunity. ,Tere said that she would not stop calling for justice, even if it falls on deaf ears.,\u201c,Hindi ako papayag na hahayaan ko na lang na ang Diyos ang bahala sa kanila,,\u201d she emphasized. \u201c,Hindi kami titigil hanggang hindi nabibigyan ng hustisya ang pagkawala ng anak ko,.\u201d,(I won't let the suspects be on the mercy of the Lord. I won't stop until I get justice for my daughter.),Losing a loved one is painful, but according to Tere, losing Rowena in a way she did not deserve makes the pain unbearable.,\u201c,Sobra sobra ang sakit na naramdaman namin ng pamilya ko,,\u201d Tere said. \u201c,Wala naman ginagawang masama si Rowena,.\u201d (The pain my family is feeling right now is too much.

It also requested the same amount for Intelligence Expenses, likewise up from P250 million allocated this year.,Audit guidelines,Because the specific disbursements and use of these funds are not spelled out, and COA relies on what the agencies themselves submit to auditors, Tan said she often asked why COA had to audit these funds.,In an attempt to set standards in reporting and documenting the use of these funds, COA came out with guidelines on the use and audit of confidential and intelligence funds in January 2015.,The ,joint circular, was formulated by COA, together with the Department of Budget and Management, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of National Defense, and the Governance Commission for GOCCs.,The guidelines spelled out stricter accounting and auditing rules to ensure that the funds are used properly. ,\"We worked hard to come up with this circular so that agencies can have some kind of standard in reporting, documenting, and utilizing these funds,\" she said. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/rich-media/146494-confidential-intelligence-funds-audit-process-coa-chair", "title": "Confidential, intel funds difficult to audit \u2013 ex-COA chair", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/nation/146051-house-appropriations-committee-budget-office-of-the-president-office-of-the-vice-president"},

He denied committing human rights abuses. (READ: ,Duterte denounces extrajudicial killing: No honor in it,),\u201c,Hindi ko ginagawa \u2018yan. Talian ko? Parang hindi ka naman lalaki kung patayin mo 'yung taong nakatali sa likod,,\u201d he said during the forum at the De La Salle University, which the DZRH and Media Bayan networks also broadcast live. ,(I don\u2019t do that. I\u2019ll tie him up? You\u2019re not a man if you kill a person who is tied up.),He clarified that all the criminals he had ordered killed resisted arrest or threatened the lives of law enforcers. ,\u201cIt\u2019s always an armed confrontation,\" he said.,\",Lumalaban talaga because they\u2019re paranoid., Almost invariably they have weapons, lethal weapons to fight it out,\" he said, describing drug lords or members of drug syndicates.,\"If I become president, there\u2019s no such thing as bloodless cleansing.

(READ: ,Duterte, Cayetano platform focuses on crime, economy,),Cayetano: President gave such order too,In a press conference after their speeches, vice-presidential candidate Alan Peter Cayetano backed up Duterte by pointing to the Aquino administration's own \"cleansing\" of terrorism.,He said President Benigno Aquino III ordered the terrorist Marwan to be taken \"dead or alive.\",\"That's why nobody knocked on doors and showed a warrant of arrest. What they're accusing the mayor of was actually [the same one] ordered by the President. Why did we not hear from Human Rights Watch against the President?\",Human Rights Watch has been ,issuing statements, implicating Duterte in human rights violations, saying those he had ordered killed included children and mere suspects.,'Rule in the outside world',Members of the audience were given a chance to react to statements made by the two politicians.,A La Sallian student had this to say: \u201cWhen Mayor Duterte was describing how bad it was in Davao, how these drug lords were actually carrying guns and threatening people.... From my perspective, okay so they\u2019re not upholding the responsibility to respect other people\u2019s lives so when they were killed, that means it wasn\u2019t actually an abuse of human rights. So I think Mayor Duterte is just standing up for justice in his city.\u201d,In the press conference, Duterte explained that it is not realistic to believe that fighting criminals, who are likely backed by powerful people, would be bloodless and clean.,\"That ain't the rule in the outside world. Others say there is speedy trial, due process. They ,think of a situation in their minds that would suit their words to their thinking.

This is his story in his own words.    ,KIDNAPPED. Former Iglesia ni Cristo minister Lowell Menorca relates how he was abducted upon the alleged orders of fellow INC members during a press conference on October 25 at the Bayview Hotel in Roxas Boulevard. By his side is wife Jinky. File photo by Lito Boras/Rappler   ,(Editor's Note: This is based on Lowell Menorca's narration made during his ,October 25 press conference, at the Bayview Hotel in Manila. He has been expelled from the Iglesia ni Cristo since his kidnapping made it to the news.),I was kidnapped in Sorsogon. It was ironically this same suit I\u2019m wearing that I wore when I officiated the worship service. It was right after the worship service that I realized the district minister Ernesto Mabasa, the KSKP minister Renato Sacdalan, and the technical minister Bien Sebastian were accomplices in the kidnapping.,They were with me when we officiated the worship service, after which I changed into a ,barong, and I was surprised for the first time since I was assigned in that locale, there were no brethren inside, after the worship service. That\u2019s very unusual because a lot of people there \u2013 especially it\u2019s a remote province \u2013 they would hang around the vicinity for a while.,I went outside. I saw the police officers. If I\u2019m not mistaken, there were around 3 uniformed officers wearing the badge of QCPD [Quezon City Police District] and 3 officers in civilian clothes. One of them I recognized, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, his surname is Suba. I\u2019m just not sure if he\u2019s a police officer but he's a brethren and I've known him because he was one of the security inside Central before.,They approached me with long rifles, they pounded at me, and they kept on shouting, \u201c,Dapa! Dapa! Dapa kung ayaw mong masaktan ,(Get down! Get down! Get down, if you don\u2019t want to get hurt).\",I was thinking to myself, I wouldn\u2019t drop down because I was wearing a ,barong,, I had no intention of running. I\u2019m no Superman, I couldn\u2019t fly, so I just bowed my head and prayed. They approached me and put the handcuffs behind me, frisked me and then put a jacket on my head, covered me up and dragged me all the way outside. I was able to get a glimpse of the whole chapel compound, surrounded by police officers, and there were a lot of non-members there too.,I was dragged into a high-end ambulance, and then swiftly, they convoyed outside, put me in another vehicle, which is a coaster, a high-end coaster. Inside, the first person I easily recognized was a minister, Benefrido Santiago. He was the team leader of the operation, and then there were also armed, heavily-armed and uniformed people inside, and the one driving the vehicle was another minister, Roldan Gavino.,Police in uniform,I was still handcuffed, we traveled all the way to Dasmari\u00f1as. We arrived there probably around 2 am. I was interrogated in between, I remained in handcuffs, my hands were bleeding, I don\u2019t know if there are still scars on my wrists, and this would prove that the handcuffs were really tight...,Around 2 am we stopped over at the safehouse there in Dasmari\u00f1as. When I saw the signage Dasmari\u00f1as that\u2019s when I got confirmation my best friend and our groomsman Attorney Vimar Barcellano was indeed behind this too.,We stopped at a safehouse there in Dasmari\u00f1as. A lot of people were inside the coaster and the other vehicles that escorted us inside the Prado, a white Prado, and a black Fortuner and another vehicle. They went inside and I remained inside the coaster. After waiting for another 30 minutes, another officer went inside.,There was a high-ranking officer inside the coaster. I knew that he was a high-ranking officer because he had a high-ranking officer uniform and the other policeman would salute him. If I\u2019m not mistaken, if I were to see a picture, I would probably [be able to] confirm [his identity]\u2026,I asked them, \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d They told me everything will be fine now, ,dadalhin ka na namin para makita mo na pamilya mo, (we will take you so you can see your family).,So the coaster followed a small red, dilapidated Kia, if I\u2019m not mistaken. The other vehicles remained in the compound, in the safehouse, and it was just the coaster and the red vehicle.,Grenade by the cemetery,It stopped along a highway. I think if I'm not mistaken, it was a cemetery. It parked, then the driver exited and I alighted from the coaster and they immediately had me sit down on the driver seat. As you can see I\u2019m a big guy, that was a small vehicle, so the steering wheel was already [close to] my chest, and they locked the door and immediately, they left the scene. The person who drove the red car went to the back side \u2013 if I were on the driver\u2019s side, he would be on the right side, he went there and threw a round thing inside the car at the back seat. I knew that it was a grenade, even though it was dark, I saw that it was round.,And then from that moment on, I just bowed down my head and prayed, I prayed for my wife and my child, so if anything were to happen to me, God would protect them so that they won\u2019t be involved in this situation that I\u2019m in. But after my prayer, realizing that [the grenade] didn\u2019t go off, I did everything I can to transfer to the passenger side, and unlocked the door. I was able to run for another few meters.,Probably, the people who got me realized there was no explosion, they went back, they looked for me and found me at the side of the road. They picked me up again and told me, why did I leave? Then the guy who was manhandling me called a person on the phone and told him, ,\u201cBakit anong nangyari? Bakit hindi natuloy? Sabi niya sige, tawagan mo na lang yung tao mo para pumunta na doon, (Why, what happened? Why didn\u2019t it push through? He said, go ahead and just call your guy so he could go there).\",I didn\u2019t know what that was all about, I just know their initial plan of killing me via grenade didn\u2019t work.,They went back and the guy was still on the phone. ,\u201cIyan na ba yung tao mo ,(Is he your man)?,\u201d, [he asked], because there was a policeman already standing in front of the car.,\u2026Then I was brought down again. This time I was seated at the back seat. I was being hysterical because the grenade was still there. With my hands at my back, I tried to reach for the grenade and found it, and I was able to hold it. And just thinking if it didn\u2019t explode, probably by holding the trigger I [could] still be able to make sure it [didn\u2019t] explode.,I [told] the policeman, \u201cThere\u2019s a grenade in here.\u201d He was trying to play dumb. \u201cWhat grenade, there's no grenade there,\u201d [he said.],\u201cThere is a grenade here,\u201d [I said], and I showed it to him, I gave it to him. He got it and gave it to another guy where the driver of the Kia before used, which was a red Vios. I think they put a tape on it.,The policeman who was about to apprehend me talked to whoever [it] was on the phone. I gave him the phone and they talked, they talked for a while, and then he ran back to the car and this time he was the one who drove it.,We drove for a couple of minutes and it was an isolated area and this time I realized [that] their plan was really to kill me. And when we were already in a very isolated area, he was already looking for a gun.,I asked him, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d ,Sabi niya, wala bang iniwang baril?, (He said, wasn\u2019t there a gun left behind?) ,Sabi ko ,(I said),, \u201c,None that I know of,.,\u201d,And even if I knew, why would I tell him? But I said, I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything. And that's when I begged him.,Begging for life,I told him, \u201cPlease don't kill me.\u201d ,Sabi ko, maawa ka na sa akin. ,Sir,, sabi ko, hindi po ako masamang tao. Ang katunayan po, ministro po ako ng Iglesia ni Cristo. Maawa na po kayo sa akin, meron po akong asawa, meron pa akong isang anak. Bata pa po ang anak ko, isa't kalahating taon pa lang, ngayon pa lang natututong magsalita. ,I was already crying to him. I am not a bad person.,(I said, please have pity on me. Sir, I said, I\u2019m not a bad person. The truth is, I am a minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo. Please have pity on me, I have a wife, I have one child. My child is still young, just a year-and-a-half, and only learning how to talk.),Sabi ko sa kanya, huwag 'nyo po naman sanang hayaan na lumaki 'yung anak kong walang ama. ,(I told him, please don\u2019t allow my child to grow up without a father.),He [asked] me, ,\u201cBakit ka ba kasi nandito?, (Why are you here in the first place?)\",I asked him if he was a brethren, ,kung kapatid siya,. ,Sabi niya, \u201cNo, kayang-kaya kong gawin kahit anong pinagagawa sa akin ,(He said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s why I can do whatever they ask me to do).\",Sabi ko,, \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me, because I know that was the plan already. ',Wag ho naman ninyo ako patayin, gagawin ko ho kahit anong gustong ipagawa sa akin basta buhayin niyo lang po ako sapat para mabuhay pa at makasama ko pa yung pamilya ko balang araw ,(Please don\u2019t kill me, I will do whatever you want me to do, so long as you let me live long enough for me to be with my family some day).\",Sabi niya, \u201cAlam mo kasi eh may ginawa kang masama.\" ,(He said, \"You know it\u2019s because you did something bad.\"),In his head, he\u2019s thinking, I was one of those rich untouchable criminals that they just had to execute. That\u2019s why I repeatedly told him that I was a minister, that I\u2019m not a bad person.,And then upon realizing that, he said, \u201c,Eh bakit ka ba kasi nandito?, (But why are you here?)\",He got his phone and called, and that\u2019s the first confirmation [I got] because that\u2019s the time when I heard the name Vimar. He was saying to the person he was talking to, ,\u201cHindi, ipagpaalam mo na lang kay Sir, eh dadalhin ko na lang sa presinto ito.\u201d Eh sabi tulog na. \u201cHindi, gisingin mo si Sir Vimar,\u201d, [he said.],(No, inform Sir that I\u2019m just taking him to the precinct. He was told he was asleep already. \u201cNo, wake up Sir Vimar.),That's how I confirmed it, and then we, he, made a U-turn.,Powerful people,Instead of killing me there, he said, ,\u201cSige, ganitong gagawin natin ha, naawa ako sa iyo eh. Sinasabi mo hindi ka naman masamang tao, eh hindi ko kayang pumatay ng walang kasalanan.\u201d Sabi niya, \u201cPero tandaan mo, kung kinakailangan gagawin ko, hindi mo naman ako kapatid sa Iglesia.,\u201d,(\u201cOkay, this is what we will do. I pity you. You\u2019re saying you\u2019re not a bad person and I can\u2019t bring myself to kill someone who is innocent.\u201d He said, \u201cBut remember, if I need to do it, I will, because I am not Iglesia brethren.\"),\u2026Nagpasalamat ako sa kanya. Sabi ko, \u201cKahit ano pong pagawa niyo sa akin, gagawin ko.\u201d And then he told me, \u201cSige, dadalhin kita sa presinto, pakakasuhan na lang kita. Kung anong ipapakaso ko sa iyo, umoo ka na lang.\u201d ,(I thanked him. I said, \u201cWhatever you ask me to do I will do.\u201d And then he told me, \u201cOkay, I will bring you to the precinct and have you charged there. Whatever you are charged with, just accept it.\"),\u2026Pagdating namin doon, ,again he briefed me, gave me an overview\u2026[and said],, \u201cBaka mamaya magsusumbong ka doon sa mga kasama mo, baka pag may dumating na, media, diyan eh ako naman ipahamak mo.\u201d ,(When we arrived there, he again briefed me and gave me an overview, and said, \u201cYou might complain to your brethren, and if the media arrive, you might put me in trouble.\"),Sabi ko, \u201cHindi po, hindi po ako magsasalita. Kung ano pong sinabi niyo sa akin 'yun pong sasabihin.\u201d,(I said, \u201cNo, no, I won\u2019t talk. Whatever you told me, that\u2019s what I will say.\"),I entered the precinct. They were all asking me what my charge was. I didn\u2019t have anything to answer. I didn\u2019t know what they were charging me [with], only to realize in the end that I was being charged with possessing a grenade.,And when they were asking me for the details\u2026,I couldn\u2019t give them any details because I didn\u2019t know exactly what they drafted for the case. And I asked the policeman, ,sabi ko, \u201cSir, yun pong chinarge niyo sa akin, sa pagkakaalam ko po, ,non-bailable, 'yun eh. Paano naman ho ako makakaalis pa nito para makita kong pamilya ko?\u201d ,(I said, \u201cSir, from what I know, what you charged me with is non-bailable. How will I be able to leave and see my family?\"),Sabi niya sa akin,, ,\u201cAlam mo, kung sino man ang gumawa sa iyo nito, eh napaka-,obvious, naman makapangyarihan. Tandaan mo, napag-utusan lang ako ng mas mataas sa akin at siya, napag-utusan ng mas mataas sa kanya kaya sumusunod lang kami sa nag-uutos. Eh hindi namin kaya ito, makapangyarihan ang gumawa nito, kaya, natitiyak ko, kapag kinulong ka, kung sinuman ang gumawa nito sa iyo, sila rin ang maaaring mag-alis nito.\u201d,(He told me, \u201cYou know, whoever did this to you is obviously powerful. Remember, I am just taking orders from a superior who, in turn, is taking orders from his superior, so we are just following orders. But we can\u2019t handle this. Someone powerful did this that\u2019s why I\u2019m certain that if you\u2019re imprisoned, whoever it is who did this to you is the only one who can undo it.\u201d),So he gave me that assurance that even though it was a criminal offense \u2013 it was a non-bailable criminal charge \u2013 that whoever was responsible, had the power and influence to\u2026just erase it like that.,So I believed them and actually I didn\u2019t have any choice, and then that's the reason why I was charged with illegal possession\u2026,Brought to fiscal\u2019s house,The funny thing is, they took me to the fiscal who signed [the papers]. I think it was a holiday, they took me there, they covered my eyes so I wouldn\u2019t see because we went to the residence of the fiscal and I didn\u2019t know that the two people who were there inside the police vehicle with us\u2026were just ordinary-looking people.,I didn\u2019t know that they were the ones\u2026they got to file the charge against me. And once we got there, he introduced the fiscal. \u201c,Eto na po yung,\u2026(This is the guy).\u201d And then they gave the paper. The fiscal asked me, ,\u201cO, alam mo ba itong ano, bakit ka ba may dalang granada?, (Do you know this? Why do you have a grenade with you?)\",Of course I couldn\u2019t answer, and then the policeman just told me, \u201cDon\u2019t answer anything.\u201d,[The fiscal said], \u201c,So basta, alam mo itong pinapasok mo, (As long as you know what you are getting into).\",Then, pinirmahan niya, tapos tinanong niya yung dalawa,\u2026(Then he signed then questioned the two)\u2026Eventually I learned that they were construction workers.,Tinanong niya, \u201cAno bang nangyari?\u201d Nagkatinginan yung dalawang ,construction workers,, hindi rin nila alam. Hanggang sa sinabi na lang nila eh, \u201cKasi po nakita kong may dala siyang granada.\u201d Tapos eh hindi ko alam kung papaano nila napaniwala yung piskal. Yung dalawang ,construction workers, they were small and they're thin,, payat sila, ,and they said na they were able to overpower me with the hand grenade.,(He asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The two construction workers looked at each other because they also didn\u2019t know. Until they just said, \u201cIt\u2019s because we saw him with a grenade.\u201d Then I don\u2019t know how they made the fiscal believe them. These two construction workers, they were small and they\u2019re thin and they said they were able to overpower me with the hand grenade.),So if this is not fiction, I don\u2019t know what is. But again, by some miracle, they were able to overpower me and were able to retrieve the hand grenade, according to them, from my hand. And that's when they reported me to the authorities.,The only thing I could say is yes, and the fiscal asked me if anybody knew where I was, if anybody could contact my relatives, and I said no, and then he signed the papers and I was again blind-folded and taken away. And then they were telling me stories.\u2026 It was a long way from the precinct and they were telling me\u2026that they were amazed that it happened to me.,They did not know the reason why, all they knew is that they were instructed by their superiors and their superiors were instructed by their superiors.,And they were telling me, \u201c,Alam mo, kung sino man may gumawa sa iyo nito, napakamakapangyarihan. Kaya ikaw lang ang makakapag-paalis din nito.\" ,(You know, whoever did this to you is extremely powerful. That's why you're the only one who can make all this go away.),\u2026Sabi niya, \u201cIlang araw mula ngayon, tiyak dadalawin ka ng kung sinumang taong may kinalaman dito para kausapin ka. Ang maipapayo ko lang sa iyo, kung ano man ang gusto nila, kung anuman ang kailangan nila, hingin nila sa iyo, ibigay mo na kasi sila lang ang puwedeng magtanggal nito.\u201d,(He said, \u201cSeveral days from now, whoever is behind this will surely visit you to talk to you. My only advice to you is, whatever it is they want, whatever it is they need or ask from you, give it to them because they are the only ones who can undo this.),Picked up construction workers,...They were the ones who told me those two guys were just construction workers. \u201c\u2026,Eto ngang dalawang ito, kinuha lang namin diyan eh, dinampot lang namin eh, (These two, we just picked them up).\",[Addressing the two and scolding them, he said], \u201c,Kayo naman\u2026hindi kayo marunong magdrama, dapat medyo may konting ano naman, eh nagbigay naman kayo ng mga detalye, hindi yung sasabihin niyo na na-,overpower, niyo, eh ang laki-laki nito. Sana sinabi niyo na lang na ganito, sabi ng isang pulis. Dalawa kasi yun eh. Dalawang pulis sa may likod tapos dalawang pulis sa may harap. Ito naman itong bata mo, sabi niya, \u201cHindi naman marunong umakting.\u201d Sabi, \u201cSige di bale, sulit naman yung dalawang daan sa inyo.\u201d, They gave them P200 each.,(You guys, you didn\u2019t know how to act, you should have tried a little and given a few details instead of just saying you overpowered him when he\u2019s so much bigger than you. You could have said this, said one police officer. Because there were two of them. There were two police officers at the back and two in front.

Tutal atin-atin lang naman. Sinabi ko sa kanila ,what happened to me in Sorsogon and then they were the ones who said,, \u201cHindi pala malinis trumabaho ang Iglesia, ano?\u201d Sabi ko, \u201cBakit naman ho?\u201d ,Eh kasi naman, biruin mo, pupunta sila doon sa Sorsogon tapos naka-uniporme pa sila, QCPD. Wala na sa ,jurisdiction, ninyo, dapat doon na lang sa Sorsogon di ba? Doon na lang trinabaho yan. Tapos galing kang Sorsogon, tapos dito ka dadalhin sa amin? Kami tuloy ang mapuputukan kapag pumutok yang ano na yan, yang issue na yan. ,(Imagine, they went to Sorsogon wearing QCPD uniforms. It\u2019s beyond their jurisdiction so they should have left it to Sorsogon, right? It should have been taken care of there. Then from Sorsogon, you\u2019re brought here to us? When this issue explodes, we\u2019ll bear the brunt of it.),Tapos, ang sabi niya, bakit sila mag-o-operate ng ganyan na may pagkakakilanlan sa kanila, wala silang ,warrant of arrest, na pinakita, wala silang ginawang, procedure., Tapos ang masama pa diyan, ginawa nila yan, ang daming ,witnesses.,(Then, he said, why would they operate that way with possible identification by others, without a warrant of arrest shown, without a procedure. Then worse, they did it with a lot of witnesses.),Barangay piyesta pala doon sa inyo, ginawa nila \u2019yan. Kaya sila mismo nagsabi, \u201cParang hindi masyadong marunong sa ganyang operation ang Iglesia ano?\u201d,(They did it during the barangay fiesta. That\u2019s why they themselves said, \u201cIt appears the Iglesia does not know how to do these types of operations, right?\"),Of course I didn\u2019t say anything any more.

Lahat kami ay sang-ayon na nakasalalay sa tamang liderato ang pagsulong ng ating bansa.

We all agreed that progress of the country depends on the right leadership. That's why we all agreed that the most important thing to do is to consider the voice and guidance of the people to ensure the reforms started will not be put to waste.),Poe, however, did not give further details, and has yet to reply to questions sent to her.,Escudero said they ate Chinese food. \"The meeting was cordial and relaxed.

(READ: ,Osme\u00f1a to Poe: Serve as VP before running for president,),Other Aquino allies however are saying that it is Roxas who should give way. ,Asked about this, Roxas, the presumed standard-bearer of the Liberal Party, said ,he is capable of sacrificing, and cited the 2010 elections as example. ,\u201c,Malinaw ang track record natin na may kakayahan tayo na magsakripisyo, na magparaya alang-alang sa mas malaking objective na pagsulong ng Daang Matuwid,,\u201d he said.,(Our track record is clear: we are capable of sacrificing, of giving way for the sake of the bigger objective, which is to continue the Daang Matuwid.),Roxas was supposed to run for president in 2010 but slid down at the last minute to make way for Aquino, whose victory was boosted by the death of his mother, EDSA Revolution icon and former president Corazon Aquino.

A writ of habeas corpus is a legal action sought on behalf of a person who has been unlawfully detained.,The petitioners claimed that Lowell, his wife Jinky, their daughter Yurie, and househelp Abbegail Yanson were being held against their will by members of the Sanggunian, the INC's top administrative body.,\u201cIt is manifest that Lowell, Jinky and Yurie Keiko Menorca, as well as their house help Abbegail Yanson, have clearly been subjected to the INC's unjustified, unlawful and inhumane restriction of their liberty,\u201d the petitioners said.,They said Jungko was able to personally witness the \"horribly stressful condition\" that the family was experiencing, with INC leaders allegedly barring them from wandering around or leaving their house to buy groceries.,Petitioners also claimed that Lowell had begged the INC to release his family, but was denied.,In July, Lowell was identified as one of several INC ministers who were allegedly abducted because he was critical of the INC leadership.,He was ,arrested, in Dasmari\u00f1as for allegedly threatening two construction workers with a hand grenade.,According to a blog post by a certain \"Antonio Ebanghelista,\" Menorca was allegedly taken away by members of the Sanggunian while he was officiating a worship service in Sorsogon.,The petitioners said this was witnessed by Menorca's wife, who claimed that she too would have been taken had she not resisted the armed men.,But she was later escorted to the INC compound in Quezon City after allegedly receiving a threatening message that she would never see her husband again unless she complied.,Lowell later appeared in a television interview with INC spokesman Edwil Zabala, which was aired on INC-run television station Net 25.,In the interview, Lowell ,denied, that he was abducted.

File photo from Poe's Facebook page ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Does President Benigno Aquino III want Senator Grace Poe to go through an internship-like preparation for the presidency? ,Aquino met with Poe for the second time to discuss the 2016 presidential elections but still did not offer her any post. In the meeting in Malaca\u00f1ang at 1 pm on Wednesday, June 10, Aquino instead asked Poe to sit in his meetings as chief executive.,Poe disclosed the details of the \u201cfrank\u201d meeting where she and the President discussed a \u201ctransition\u201d for 2016. The meeting lasted two and a half hours. ,\u201c,Inimbita niya ako mag-obserba sa mga bagay na p'wede niyang gawin kasi alam niyang may katanungan din ako, may sariling pag-iisip, so gusto niyang iklaro kung may questions. Kunyari, may certain meeting siya with agri, may mga katanungan ako, iniimbitahan niya ako sumama sa meeting para maobserbahan ko,,\u201d Poe told reporters at the Senate. ,(He invited me to observe things that he can do because he knows I also have questions, I have my own mind, so perhaps he wants to clarify if there are questions. For example, if he has a certain meeting with the agriculture sector, if I have questions, he is inviting me to join him in the meeting so I can observe.) ,Asked why Aquino extended the invitation, Poe said it was probably because she asked him many questions about some of his programs of government like those on inclusive growth and irrigation. ,\u201cSabi niya, 'Next week, pumunta ka dito,' pero sabi ko may commitment. Sabi niya anytime and his line is open,\u201d ,Poe said.,(He said, \"Next week, come here,\" but I said I have a prior commitment. He said, anytime, and his line is open.) ,Poe smiled when reporters joked that the invitation sounded like an on-the-job training (OJT).,This is the second time Aquino and Poe met to discuss the 2016 polls after a ,first meeting, on May 5 also in Malaca\u00f1ang. Aquino is the chairman of the ruling Liberal Party (LP).,An independent senator, Poe is widely seen as a formidable candidate for higher office because of her ,strong survey showing,. The neophyte politician ranks second only to opposition standard-bearer Vice President Jejomar Binay, while LP president-on-leave and presumptive presidential bet Interior Secretary Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas II is lagging behind. ,Like in the first meeting, there was no clarity on whether Aquino wanted Poe to become the administration candidate for president or vice president.  ,\u201cMalamang kinokonsidera niya siguro ako, pero 'di ko alam talaga kung anong posisyon. 'Di namin pinag-usapan,\u201d ,Poe said. (Maybe he is considering me, but I really do not know for what position. We did not discuss that.) ,Aquino told Poe that he will announce his chosen candidate after his State of the Nation Address on July 27 but did not indicate the exact date. ,Poe said she and Aquino will meet again, depending on the President's availability. ,'Be ready just in case',Poe said Aquino also did not mention who she should team up with if she seeks a higher post under the administration banner.,\u201c,Wala namang sinasabi ang Pangulo na kailangang katambal mo ay ganito o kailangang gawin mo iyan. Basta lamang maging handa kung saka-sakali na sana ay maipagpatuloy ang maayos na pamamalakad,,\u201d she said. ,(The President did not say that you should be in tandem with this or that or that I need to do this or that. He just said I should be ready, just in case, to continue his good leadership.) ,The senator added that she made it clear to Aquino that she prefers to remain independent. He in turn explained his party's process of choosing candidates for 2016. ,\u201cSinabi nga niya sa LP daw, patas silang mamili. Lahat sila ay may opinyon, at 'di lang iisa o iilang tao lamang. Pero ang sinabi ko rin sa kanya, 'ginagalang ko iyon, pero dahil independent ako at nangyari rin iyon noong 2013 coalition, nasabi ko naman iyon, ang aking opinyon tungkol dito.,\u201d ,(He said that the LP is fair in decision-making. All of them have an opinion. It's not just one person or a few people. But I told him that I respect that, but because I am indepenent, and that also happened in the 2013 coalition. I also said that, my opinion on that.) ,In 2013, the former censors chief ran under the administration ticket called Team PNoy but remained an independent candidate.,Poe said the President did not object when she mentioned her stand on maintaining her independence. She said Aquino did not force her to join the LP. ,\u201cKasi sinabi ko naman, 'Mr President, alam ninyo naman, kahit sa ating mga kababayan, parang hindi naman maganda na bago na lang maghalalan, saka ka magpapalit ng partido o magkakaroon ng partido.' Naintindihan naman niya iyon, pero inesplika rin niya sa akin ang kanilang paninindigan sa LP na 'ginagalang ko naman na sila raw ay may proseso sa pagpili.\u201d,(Because I told him, \u201cMr President, you and even our countrymen know that it does not look good that politicians switch parties or join parties shortly before an election.\u201d He understood that, but he also explained the LP stand, and I respect that they have a process for choosing candidates.) ,LP stalwarts, including Senate President Franklin Drilon and Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, have said that they prefer that a member of the party become the administration candidate. Drilon and Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr endorsed Roxas, and urged him to ,declare his presidential candidacy now. ,'Aquino did not name Mar as bet',Poe said Aquino did not tell her that Roxas is already the LP's standard-bearer. ,\u201cWalang statement na ganoon, pero sabi niya mabuting tao si Sec Mar at may potensyal din. May kompyansa siya kay Sec Mar,,\u201d Poe said. (There was no statement like that, but he said Sec Mar is a good person. He trusts Sec Mar.) ,In a previous interview, Aquino said Roxas remained \",at the top\" of his list, of potential candidates following reports that he seemed inclined to choose Poe as presidential bet. ,Yet Poe said that Aquino told her in their second meeting that his list of possible administration candidates included her close friend and fellow independent politician, Senator Francis Escudero. ,\u201c[The President] mentioned he will also talk to Senator Chiz. I did not have to tell him that I am ,more comfortable, with Senator Chiz because they know each other for a longer time,\" Poe said. ,On LP members' statements that they do not want Escudero as candidate, Poe said, \u201cBut the President said they have a democratic process of choosing. So it depends how many LP members think that way. We don't know. If they include everyone, and even NGO members, their decision might change.\u201d,After her second meeting with Aquino, Poe said that she would rather decide on her political plans close to the filing of certificates of candidacy in October. She said her ultimate consideration is the programs she can offer to the people. ,\u201cImportante, ano ang gagawin ko para sa mga magsasaka. Ano ang gagawin ko para sa kalusugan, sa edukasyon? Mahabang proseso iyon.\u201d ,(What's important is what I will do for farmers. What will I do for health, education? That's a long process.) ,She admitted, \u201c,Wala rin naman akong makinarya at limitadong-limitado kung mayroon man akong pera,.\u201d (I don't have machinery, and if I have money, that is so limited.) \u2013, Rappler.com, , ,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

Several individuals and environmental groups bring their anti-coal struggle to the Supreme Court. All photos by Inoue Jaena/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Several environmental groups and individuals on Friday, June 30, filed a case with the Supreme Court (SC) against the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for neglecting their duties as \"vanguards of energy security and environmental sustainability.\",This is the \"first ever case on coal\" in the Supreme Court against the two government agencies, according to the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice (PMCJ), one of the petitioners in the case.,The PMCJ, together with other individuals and groups, filed a 65-page petition for continuing mandamus, with application for a temporary environmental protection order.,The other petitioners in the case are the following:,In their prefatory statement, the petitioners \u2013 as represented by their legal counsel Jose Manuel Diokno \u2013 noted that the DOE is mandated under Republic Act 9513 or the Renewable Energy Act to \"reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.\",Meanwhile, the petitioners said the DENR is mandated under Republic Act 8749 or the Clean Air Act to \"strictly regulate the operations of coal-fired power plants because of the hazard they pose to the environment and our health.\",The petitioners then noted that both government agencies have \"allowed coal plants to proliferate, making the country more, instead of less, dependent on fossil fuels.\", ,They also believe that the DOE neglected its duty to formulate a Renewable Portfolio Standards Rules and to establish the Green Energy Options Program, while the DENR neglected its duty to do the following:,\"As a direct result of the failure of DENR and DOE to do their duties specifically enjoined by law and their respective offices, the country has had to rely on dirty energy generated by coal plants that have been operating without proper standards, without accountability, and without regard to their adverse impact on the environment and the people's health,\" the groups' prefatory statement read.,The groups believe the Philippines will be \"locked in to costly and harmful coal contracts for generations to come,\" unless the SC intervenes.,They also noted that the Philippines, as one of the countries that ,ratified the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement,, has pledged to cut by 70% its carbon emissions by 2030.,Thus, through the petition, the groups hope to compel both the DOE and the DENR to \"perform acts that the laws specifically enjoin as duties resulting from their office, there being no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\",For the petitioners, until the agencies fulfill their duties as mandated by law, a temporary environmental protection order must be issued to stop the DENR from processing environmental compliance certificate applications for coal-fired power plants, and from issuing coal plants with authority to construct and permit to operate.,They also want the SC to stop the DOE from issuing a certificate of endorsement to coal plants, and service contracts with coal plant proponents.,\"We are finally filing a case to seek the intervention of the Supreme Court against an act of total disregard on the laws of the land by our own government agencies that resulted to continuously increasing number of environmental and societal damages,\" PMCJ National Coordinator Ian Rivera said in a statement Friday.,According to the PMCJ, this case includes members of the community ,in Limay, Bataan,, as petitioners.

Family and friends only have praises for Roman 'Oman' Manaois who was killed by unidentified gunmen on July 19. Photo from Melandrew Velasco  ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 Wrong place, wrong time.,That\u2019s how relatives of Roman Clifford Manaois described his untimely death in the hands of unidentified gunmen on July 19 in Dagupan City, Pangasinan. ,Cecil Manaois told Rappler in an interview on Thursday, July 28, her son was just supposed to go to the city market to eat ,kaleskes,, a local delicacy. ,Oman, as fondly called by family and friends, was picked up at 9 pm from his house by a tricycle driven by his friend, ,Julio*,. On the way to Galvan Market, a neighbor named Zaldy Abalos hailed the vehicle and requested to be dropped off at Lucao district.,While paying his fare at his destination, Zaldy was gunned down at close range by men wearing bonnets. ,According to Oman\u2019s relative, Melandrew Velasco, Julio, who was able to flee, recalled that Oman held up his hands, seemingly asking for mercy, when the gunmen turned to him.,The merciless suspects, however, proceeded to kill the 20-year-old Oman. ,\u201c,Tinaas pa raw ni, ,Oman, a,ng mga kamay niya pero binaril pa rin sa tagiliran na tumama sa puso,,\u201d Velasco told Rappler. \u201c,Just to make sure he was dead,, ,binaril ulit siya sa, temple ,niya,.\u201d,(Oman held up his hands but he was still shot at the side, which hit his heart. Just to make sure he was dead, he was again shot in his temple.),Oman, the good son,What was supposed to be a short trip to satisfy a craving ended the dreams not just of Oman, but also his family.,The second of 4 children to a housewife and a disabled father, Oman was the breadwinner who worked while studying. He often tagged along with his uncle who took on electrical wiring jobs around the city.,Oman was also just a few months shy from graduating and was scheduled to take an overseas job in Dubai. The job, Melandrew said, would have helped his family tremendously. ,\u201c,Siya sana iyong mage,-,emancipate, ,ng pamilya niya from, ,hardships in life, (He was supposed to emancipate his family from hardships in life),\u201d he explained.,The Oman the people of Barangay Carael grew up knowing was far from the suspected drug users and pushers who wound up behind bars \u2013 or worse, dead \u2013 as the present administration\u2019s war on drugs intensifies. ,Everyone only had praises for Oman, according to Cecil.,\u201c,Madami ang magpapatunay sa kabaitan ng anak ko at wala talagang masasabing masama tungkol sa kanya,,\u201d she told Rappler. \u201c,Hindi ko binubuhat ang sarili kong anak, pero madami dito sa amin na nanghihinayang sa pagkawala niya kasi talagang napakabait na bata.,\u201d,(There are a lot of people who can testify to my son\u2019s goodness and nothing bad can ever be said about him. I\u2019m not saying this just because he\u2019s my son, but a lot of people have felt bad about his death because he was really a good kid.),Sacristan,JUSTICE. Melandrew Velasco, Oman's relative, takes to Facebook his call for justice for his death.  ,His death was a surprise to many who knew Oman as the good son who did odd jobs to help his family, the loving grandson who spent the last hours of his life tending to his 71-year-old, half-blind grandmother, and the selfless community member who served as a sacristan in the local parish, among others.,\u201c,Talagang nagulat silang lahat at hindi sila makapaniwala ,(Everyone was surprised and they really couldn\u2019t believe what happened),,\u201d ,Cecil said. ,His family, however, couldn't help but feel hurt by the various comments online accusing Oman of being involved in illegal drugs.,\u201c,Ang hiling ko lang sana ay huwag nilang husgahan ang anak ko kasi patay na nga, kawawa naman,,\u201d Cecil stressed. \u201c,Marami pa kaming naririnig na masasakit na salita,.\u201d,(I just wish people would stop judging my son. He\u2019s already dead, I pity him. And yet we still hear a lot of hurtful words.),Notorious Zaldy,It was Zaldy who was reportedly notorious for being involved in the drug trade.,\u201c,Dalawang kagawad na sa amin ang nagsabi na wala talaga, na hindi sangkot si Oman sa kahit anong droga,,\u201d Cecil explained. \u201c,Nadamay lang talaga ang anak ko kasi nagkataon na nasa maling lugar lang siya,.\u201d,(Two village officials already said that Oman wasn\u2019t involved in illegal drugs. He was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.),Melandrew, meanwhile, cited the coroner\u2019s report that said Oman\u2019s body had no trace of illegal substance.,\u201c,Sabi pa nga nila, sayang ang batang ito kasi malinis ang katawan,,\u201d he said. \u201c,Malinis siya at mabuting anak,.\u201d (They even told us that it\u2019s a pity since his body\u2019s clean. He\u2019s clean and a very good son.),Justice?,Oman is just one of the many individuals killed by unidentified gunmen. ,In Dagupan City, for example, a 22-year-old graduating honor student was also found dead the day Oman was killed. She also did not fit the profile of a drug suspect.,\u201cIt's just alarming to say the least that a life can be snuffed out anytime just by being at the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d Melandrew said. \u201cOman\u2019s case is not an isolated case as there are other killings that are being perpetrated on suspects, but it's easy to label one as a user or a pusher.\u201d,According to data from the Philippine National Police, as of August 22, over 1,160 individuals have been killed outside police operations. With 900 drug personalities killed in legitimate operations, as of August 31, this brings the total number of drug-related deaths to at least 2,160.,PNP Chief Director Ronald dela Rosa said during a Senate hearing on August 22 that those killed outside legitimate operations are considered \"deaths under investigations.\" Perpetrators are unknown.,The lack of identifying features \u2013 most suspects wore bonnets over their heads \u2013  hinder the investigation process and eventually, also prevent families of victims from attaining justice.,Julian, the sole witness, was not able to see the  face of the gunmen who killed both Zaldy and Oman. Police Inspector Enrique Columbia of Dagupan City Police District\u2019s Investigation Unit told Rappler that investigation is still ongoing based on his statement. ,Cecil wants justice to be served. But the lack of information on who might be responsible for the death of her son sometimes makes her feel hopeless.,\u201c,Kahit naman magdemanda kami, hindi naman alam kung sino ang pumatay sa kanya kaya sino ang ituturo namin ,(Even if we file a case, we still don\u2019t know who killed him so who will we blame)?\u201d she asked.,\u201c,Pero ipapasa-Diyos na lang namin iyong mga gumawa nito sa kanya.

Petitioners who want the construction of DMCI Homes' Torre de Manila refer to the condominium as 'Terror de Manila.' Image from 'NO to DMCI's \"Terror de Manila\"' Facebook page,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Where were the country's cultural agencies when the ,controversial Torre de Manila project, by DMCI Homes was approved?,Torre de Manila is a 46-story residential building currently being constructed between Rizal Park and Adamson University. Located within Manila City's Institutional University Cluster, it is only allowed a maximum gross-floor-area-to-area-of-the-plot ratio of 4. (Gross floor area refers to the total floor area inside the building.) But based on construction plans, its floor area ratio will be 7.79, thus violating zoning laws under Ordinance No 8119.,But it's the desecration of the national park across the street that bothers many Filipinos much more than the zoning violation. Once Torre de Manila is complete, it will rise behind the Rizal Monument, dwarfing the shrine and resting place of the national hero, ruining what heritage advocate Carlos Celdran calls \"the sanctity of the Rizal sightline.\",Fierce opponents of the project have even renamed it \"Terror de Manila,\" dreading the day when they cannot take a photo of the Rizal Shrine without also capturing the high-rise condominium.,Celdran's ,online petition, urging Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada to suspend the building permit of Torre de Manila now has more than 7,900 signatures. ,'Conspiracy',Public outcry against Torre de Manila was first heard in June 2012 when Celdran found out about the construction and raised a ruckus online. But DMCI countered that it had all the required building permits from City Hall.,The Manila City Council at the time then conducted an investigation on Melvin Balagot, the City Building official in charge of issuing permits for construction projects in the city. The investigation concluded that there was a \"conspiracy\" between Balagot and DMCI. ,CONSPIRACY? The Manila City Council in 2012 concluded in an investigation that City Building Official Melvin Balagot and DMCI conspired to flout zoning laws. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler,Both parties did not attend public hearings held by the Council to discuss Torre de Manila's alleged violations. They also ignored the Council's unanimously approved Resolution No 121 enjoining Balagot to \"temporarily suspend the building permit of the Torre de Manila project until an acceptable development design is approved under proper compliance with the standards and policy guidelines set by the National Historical Commission.\",Construction continued. The City Council then decided to shift gears and oppose the project by citing its negative effects on the Rizal Shrine. DJ Bagatsing, a Manila councilor who was also a councilor at the time, contacted the National Historical Commission (NHCP) for their stance on Torre de Manila.,NHCP is the prime government agency dealing directly with national monuments and cultural and historical landmarks. ,Republic Act 10066 or the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009 gives the NHCP the power to issue a Cease and Desist Order \"when the physical integrity of the national cultural treasures or important cultural properties are found to be in danger of destruction or significant alteration from its original state.\",The same law states that the \"appearance of streets, parks, monuments, buildings\u2026within a locality shall be maintained as close to their appearance at the time the area was of most importance to Philippine history as determined by the National Historical Institute.\" (,NHI is the former name of NHCP,),NHCP flipflops,When NHCP attended the June 22, 2012 hearing on Torre de Manila, their position was clear: Torre de Manila violates NHCP guidelines on monuments honoring national heroes.,In fact, according to Bagatsing who was present at the hearing, the NHCP representatives Wilkie Delumen and Crisanto Lustre presented the guidelines as basis for why DMCI's project should not push through.,According to the guidelines which can be found in the ,NHCP website,, the dominance of national monuments like the Rizal Shrine should be protected:,\"Monuments should be given due prominence since they symbolize national significance\u2026the Rizal National Monument in Luneta and the Bonifacio National Monument are established as objects of reference. The monument should preferably be the focal point of a city or town center.\",The guidelines further state that one measure for preserving dominance is to \"keep vista points and visual corridors to monuments clear for unobstructed viewing appreciation and photographic opportunities.\",HERO'S SHRINE. The Rizal Shrine is the central feature of Luneta Park and houses the remains of national hero Jose Rizal. Photo from CARLOS CELDRAN Facebook page,The guidelines seek to implement the constitutionally-enshrined directive that \"all the country's artistic and historic wealth constitutes the cultural treasure of the nation and shall be under the protection of the State which may regulate its disposition (Article VI on Arts and Culture, Section 16).\",But 6 months after the presentation, NHCP changed its stance.,NHCP Chairperson Maria Serena Diokno wrote to DMCI consultant Alfredo Andrade that DMCI need not worry about NHCP condemning the project.,\"Your project site is outside the boundaries of the Rizal Park and well to the rear of the Rizal National Monument, hence it cannot possibly obstruct the front view of the said National Monument,\" she wrote in the Nov 6, 2012 letter obtained by Rappler.,But in the next line, Diokno recommended that Manila City Hall enact \"an ordinance designating a buffer zone around Rizal Park and prescribing guidelines building development\" to prevent the recurrence of a similar \"dilemma\" in the future.,Bagatsing, who was counting on NHCP to support a dialogue between DMCI and stakeholders, was baffled by the agency's sudden backing off.,To pursue the issue, he called NHCP Executive Director Ludovico Badoy but only got exasperated.  ,\"I called him and asked, 'Sir, what's your take on this project?' I got shocked because he said he was for it,\" Bagatsing told Rappler.,Badoy said that Torre de Manila \"does not violate any law.\" When Bagatsing persisted that it would obstruct the vista of Rizal Shrine, Badoy allegedly said, \",Bakit, sa gilid mayroon na, (Why, on the sides there are already buildings),\" referring to Eton Baypark Manila, another residential building.,At one point, Badoy raised his voice saying, \"The board has already approved it. There's nothing we can do.\",When Rappler asked Badoy for a clarification of NHCP's support for the project, he merely repeated what Diokno said in her letter. When asked to explain the apparent contradiction between NHCP's guidelines on preserving the monument's sightline vista and Diokno's statement that Torre de Manila \"cannot possibly obstruct the front view\" of the monument, Badoy did not reply.,CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES. As of October 14, Torre de Manila's foundation is complete and its slab fill is 45% complete. Photo from DMCI website,[See original image ,here,],Protecting the sightline,Bagatsing is frustrated that NHCP is ignoring its own guidelines that would've nipped the Torre de Manila dilemma in the bud.,\"That's the only remaining unhampered sightline of the Rizal Shrine \u2013 the front view which is the most important perspective. Just because it already happened in the sides of the monument, doesn't make it a good argument,\" he said.,\"The Rizal Shrine is called the national monument. It is the most important monument in the country. If NHCP is going to use technicalities for something that obviously will cheapen and degrade the sanctity of the Rizal Shrine, then there's something wrong with that.\",All the Manila City Council wants is for a dialogue between DMCI and local stakeholders to take place, emphasized Bagatsing.,\"We're not even saying they cannot build Torre de Manila. There are ways to meet half-way. They can reduce the height of the building so it doesn't ruin the sightline. They can put trees, change the design.\",With a new city building official in place and a new mayor, Bagatsing remains hopeful that the issue can be resolved. He is set to call for a resolution once more to temporarily suspend Torre de Manila's building permit. He also plans to seek the support of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), a commission even higher than the NHCP.,Meanwhile, \"Terror de Manila\" construction continues.

He wants to complete consultations with his broad coalition, he has repeatedly said.,One of those who had been vocal in seeking the President's endorsement is Vice President Jejomar Binay, even when he was still the front runner in surveys on voters' preference for president. In an interview on ANC in October 2014, he said it was his ,\"legitimate hope\" to get Aquino's endorsement,.,WHO WILL IT BE? President Benigno Aquino III is expected to announce his preferred successor in July. File Photo from the Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau   , ,\"If you get endorsed, that is plus one [vote] for you \u2013 from the President, no less,\" he said then.,Binay later hoped for a \u201c,secret endorsement,,\u201d at least, from his family friend and erstwhile ally, but was said to have resigned from his Cabinet posts when it became certain this would be ,impossible,.,Neophyte Senator Grace Poe, who is now leading other potential presidential candidates in polls, is also in ,talks with Aquino, on the 2016 elections. ,What is the weight of a presidential anointment? Would it really help a presidential candidate? ,3 factors,Asked about the value of a presidential endorsement, political analyst Ramon Casiple said in a phone interview that this would depend on several factors, among them, the endorser\u2019s popularity.,\"If you're popular, there's a certain segment of voters that will take the endorsement as a guide,\u201d Casiple said in a mix of English and Filipino.,He said another important factor is the government resources at one\u2019s disposal as incumbent president. \u201cSince you are the incumbent, you have the control as far as government resources are concerned. Whoever you endorse would, of course, benefit from this.\",The third, said Casiple, is the \u201cpsychological impact\u201d of a presidential endorsement. He said this is because the anointed candidate would usually get more media coverage and thus, greater public exposure.,\u201cWhen a sitting president endorses somebody, there's a value in terms of projection because the media will cover that candidate,\u201d he said.,Casiple said, however, that all these factors combined still cannot assure a \u201cdecisive\u201d victory. In the end, what would weigh heaviest is the voter\u2019s own discernment of the fitness of a candidate to lead the country.,Cory magic,The President's late mother supposedly managed to give a powerful endorsement in the 1992 elections, even when she suffered from low public approval \u2013 a feat referred to as \"Cory magic.\",In 1991, President Corazon Aquino blessed the candidacy of her former defense secretary, Fidel V. Ramos. Though she suffered from her lowest-ever popularity rating \u2013 enough to discourage re-election \u2013 her endorsement was seen as a lifeline to Ramos, who formed his own party after the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino chose Speaker Ramon Mitra Jr as its standard-bearer.,CORY AQUINO AND FIDEL RAMOS. President Corazon Aquino and General Fidel V. Ramos stand together after a coup attempt in 1987 that almost killed her son. Photo from gov.ph   ,Backed by a newly-formed party and with far less resources than other candidates like businessman Eduardo Cojuangco Jr, Ramos won with 23.58% of the votes \u2013 a narrow margin of less than a million votes over second placer Miriam Defensor Santiago. ,When it was his turn to choose his preferred successor, Ramos tapped  partymate and loyal ally Speaker Jose de Venecia. (READ: ,When a president betrays a friend,) ,Based on the results of a Social Weather Stations survey, Ramos' net satisfaction rating in April 1998, or a month before the elections, was a \"moderate\" +19.,The endorsement was supposed to have been boosted by Ramos' economic legacy. Power supply was restored under his administration; monopolies in key industries such as telecommunications and banking ended. But this was no match to the sheer popularity of Joseph Estrada, who handily won the presidency with over 8 million votes. De Venecia, at second place, got less than half of that.,Kiss of death,The 2004 elections could be seen as a battle of endorsements of two presidents \u2013 the incumbent and the one who was ousted. Estrada, ousted and then detained for plunder charges, supported the candidacy of actor Fernando Poe Jr, while the incumbent, President Gloria Macapagal sought re-election.,At the time, Arroyo's net satisfaction rating was a \"good\" +30, the highest in her presidency, and perhaps just enough to help her beat Poe by just over a million votes. The 2004 elections, however, had been marred by fraud allegations.,By March 2010, the last SWS survey period under the Arroyo presidency, her net satisfaction rating hit rock bottom \u2013 a \"very bad\" -53. This made her presidential endorsement the most potent in the country's political history, but not in a good way.  ,Her so-called \"kiss of death\" struck two candidates in the 2010 presidential race \u2013 administration standard-bearer Gilbert \u201cGibo\u201d Teodoro Jr and more so, former Senator Manuel Villar, the early front-runner who had the misfortune of being tagged as her \u201csecret candidate.\",'Pivotal' player,With less than a year before the May 9, 2016 elections, Aquino's net satisfaction rating bounced back to a \"very good\" +30 in June, from his lowest-ever rating of +11 in March. ,In a phone interview, Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, a Liberal Party stalwart, explained that the value of Aquino's endorsement does not only lie in his popularity, but also in the circumstances that led him to Malaca\u00f1ang. Add to this his performance in the last 5 years.,CORY MAGIC. Public grief over the death of democracy icon Cory Aquino catapulted Benigno Aquino III into the presidency. File photo from Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau ,\"You have to go back to 2010 and understand what happened then. When from nowhere, reluctant that he was, he became the president. Because I think that is key to understanding also how the reforms that he has successfully implemented these past years can continue in 2016,\" Abad said.,Abad said the Aquino administration helped turn the Philippines into the fastest-growing economy in the region, and proof of this, among others, is its 22 credit rating upgrades in the past 5 years. He also cited improved social services, and other governance reforms. ,\"I think, he [Aquino] has earned that privilege of guiding our people to the next level. That\u2019s how I would see and contextualize why he will be a key, if not pivotal, player in 2016,\" he said.,Abad added: \"As you face this conjuncture, President Aquino is going to play a critical role because like Cory, he will now be the reference. [People would] go back to him and ask him, 'Mr President, who do you think should we trust to continue what you have done?'\",Will Aquino's popularity be enough to compensate for a less popular candidate? Abad said the President has not made his choice yet, but the Chief Executive's high public approval and trust ratings would be a \"significant push.\",\"It\u2019s going to be a significant addition to whatever votes the anointed candidate would be able to draw. And I think that will be a big advantage,\" he said.,Unless, of course, Aquino suffers from another controversy that would erode his popularity. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,\u201cThe Scrum\u201d is Rappler's take on issues and personalities of the 2016 elections.

An equal number said they would vote for Manila Mayor and former President Joseph \u201cErap\u201d Estrada.,The two are tied at 3rd place after front runner Vice President Jejomar \u201cJojo\u201d Binay, who garnered 29%, and Senator Grace Poe, who got 14%.,Binay's 29% is 3 percentage points higher than his 26% in November 2014. Since that time, he has been linked to corruption scandals in Makati, including the alleged overpricing of the ,Makati City Hall parking building,.,The survey had a sample size of 1,200 and an error margin of \u00b13%. The error margin indicates a marginal increase for Binay and a marginal decline as well for Poe. But because they moved in different directions, Binay is \"now significantly ahead,\" according to Pulse Asia.,Binay's spokesman Rico Quicho said the survey results reaffirm the \"people's desire for a competent and experienced leader to lead the country forward. Despite the never-ending attacks by political opponents on the accomplishments of the Vice President, the people have come to understand and accept that all these are just loose allegations without any basis in fact and in law.\", ,Support,As expected, Duterte\u2019s support base is in Mindanao, where he was preferred by 34%. Binay was strongest in the Visayas, where he got 35%, while Poe was strongest in the National Capital Region (NCR), where she got 18%. Estrada was strongest also in Mindanao, where he got 18%.,The survey comes after the bloody Mamasapano clash on January 25. The encounter resulted in the death of 67 people, including 44 Special Action Force troopers, 5 civilians, and 18 Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels. Subject of various investigations, the massacre was seen to be the worst political disaster to face the Aquino presidency.,Senate investigations led by Poe, who is chair of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, showed that the President \u201c,must bear the responsibility,\u201d for the botched operation. Investigations also revealed that Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II was kept out of the loop. Binay seized the offensive, saying that the Mamasapano incident raises questions about ,Roxas\u2019 leadership,.,In the latest Pulse Asia survey, Roxas placed 6,th, with his 4% rating \u2013 lower compared to his previous rating of 6% in the ,November 14-20, 2014, survey,. In that same November survey, Poe rated higher at 18%. Binay got 26% compared to his latest 29% rating.,The entry of Duterte eased out Senator ,Francis \u201cChiz\u201d Escudero,, who wed celebrity Heart Evangelista in a grand Balesin Island Club ceremony only last February. He tied Roxas at 6,th, spot with his 4% rating. In the previous November survey, Escudero was in the top 5 with 7%. ,Senator ,Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr,, who chairs the Senate ,committee on local government, and public works, entered the top 5 presidential preferences list with his 6% rating, higher than his previous 4%.

Photo by Mark Cristino/EPA ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 If President Benigno Aquino III were in the audience, he would have been inconvenienced by former US Vice President Al Gore\u2019s presentation at the Climate Reality Leadership Corps training on Monday, March 14, in Manila. ,In the updated version of the iconic presentation ,An Inconvenient Truth,, which he introduced a decade ago, Gore noted that Philippines is still dependent on fossil fuels, one of the primary culprits of climate change. , ,Since the 2006 launch of his award-winning film ,An Inconvenient Truth,, global awareness efforts on the climate crisis have gone a long way. In the film, Gore lent his voice to scientific facts on global warming, warning about its catastrophic effects if the amount of man-made greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide is not significantly cut. (READ: ,Al Gore visits Yolanda 'ground zero',),Coal-fired power plants, which spew greenhouse gases, remain the Philippine\u2019s largest energy source at 29%, followed by oil at 23%. This runs counter to the global trend in green energy production, suggested Gore.,\"In the thinking of many nations, the leadership has not caught up with the new reality,\u201d Gore said, ,\"Carbon is the number one threat to the global economy,\u201d warned Gore, who was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to build up awareness about climate change., ,Coal use on upswing in PH,Senator Loren Legarda, chair of the Senate Committee on Climate Change, raised the same concern in her keynote speech at the 3-day leadership training.,\"Philippine consumption of coal has been on the upswing, which increased by 27% between 2012 and 2014,\u201d  Legarda said. (READ: ,The road to decarbonization,) ,The country needs an additional 13,167 megawatts of power capacity by 2030. More than half of this projected energy demand is expected to be generated from coal-fired power plants.,\"Coal-fired power plants are the country\u2019s dominant power technology because economically, they are widely available and easy to build,\u201d Legarda said.,Challenging this argument usually given by governments and the coal industry, Legarda said that the Philippines should work towards achieving \"a good energy mix where there is a bias for renewables.\u201d,Legarda noted that the country has 246,000 megawatts of untapped sun, tidal ocean power, wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydro resources. ,\"This is 13 times more than the current installed capacity!\u201d , ,Biggest new investment opportunity ,Gore explained the \u201crevolutionary change\u201d that has been sweeping through the energy sector is because of significant progress in renewable energy sources.,\"This is the biggest new investment opportunity in the history of world\u2019s business,\u201d he said.,As an example, Gore highlighted the cost of solar energy which has been decreasing at a rate of 10% every year for 30 years. ,This contributed to dramatic increases in solar energy production, Gore said, suggesting that renewable energies are winning the financial argument. For instance, a 2010 projection expected the solar energy market to grow by only one gigawatt per year by 2010, but in 2015, the target was exceeded 58 times. In 2016, the same goal is expected to be surpassed 68 times, stressed Gore.,The landmark ,Paris Agreement, forged in December 2015, believed to have put fossil fuels on the \"wrong side\u201d of history, is also expected to accelerate green energy growth.

For Siders, a rapidly changing environment, one that would look vastly different in fifteen years, requires a reassessment of energy use. ,Carbon tax ,For Japhet Kariuki, Future Energy Leader of the World Energy Council, the carbon tax is an answer to the problem of carbon emissions. As a solution, however, it's not as simple as it seems due to its wide implementation in 250 countries. Furthermore, a carbon tax is not equitable as countries like the Philippines that emit less carbon than other countries often bear the brunt of the damaging effects of global warming.,The differences in the local versus global situations means that developing countries, especially those that are undergoing rapid development, would have to put in place strong institutions who have a vision for industry in their respective nations and are able to implement their visions.,Tana Jambaldorj, Planning Analyst at Rio Tinto, used the example of Mongolia. It was a rapidly growing country with 17% of foreign investment in the mining industry, but it did not know what to do with it. This resulted in a \u201chaphazard\u201d set of rules for the mining industry and the wealth it generated. She stressed the importance of making the mining and extracting industries capable of being environmentally responsible.,Global problem, local solutions ,For the panel, fixing the relatively unique environmental problems of countries involves local engagement with the problems and a different approach. Siders cited \u201cStop Trying to Save the World,\u201d an article by Michael Hobbes featured in The New Republic, in talking about localizing solutions. \u201cJust because it works in one place doesn\u2019t mean you can scale up and use it to save the world,\u201d she said.,This applied to ,sustainable development, as well. Lauded as a general answer to the world\u2019s environmental problems, Siders believes that it wasn\u2019t so much a solution as a step.,What is needed, according to Siders, is finding better ways to find the problem and being able to communicate solutions better. ,\u201c,Actually identifying the problem is sometimes the most important part. Where is the barrier between talk and action?,\u201d ,she said. ,The best solutions themselves are, according to the panel, the simplest ones. Kariuki looks to Norway,\u2019,s example of harnessing its waste for energy production and compares it to Manila which has ,\u201c,tons of waste.,\u201d ,Finally, being able to move between fields and communicate information is important and this is where interdisciplinary studies plays a major role.

Seeing themselves in the suffering and dark-skinned Christ, up to 8-M Filipinos flock to Quiapo for the Black Nazarene procession every January 9. File photo,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It drives devotees to tears while it leaves the others, including Catholics themselves, shaking their heads in bewilderment. For millions, it is faith; for others, fanaticism.,Even the man who supervises Quiapo Church \u2013 Msgr Jose Clemente Ignacio \u2013 used to struggle with the 400-year-old devotion to the Black Nazarene. It is easy, the rector said, to judge up to 8-M Catholics who ,troop to Quiapo, every January 9, to see or touch the dark-skinned image of the suffering Christ.,Once a skeptic who scoffed at his devotee-mother's \u201cnonsense\u201d in Quiapo, Ignacio cautioned against a \u201cWestern\u201d or \u201celitist\u201d perspective on the devotion. In a paper redistributed to prepare for the procession on Wednesday, January 9, he said living with devotees, as he does, could change a person's views about their practices.,How, after all, can one simply dismiss their persistence under the scorching heat, and ,despite a terror threat,? Or the risks they take, like being trampled upon, to get near the image of the Black Nazarene? What about their unwavering faith that somehow, a vow to walk barefoot and ,pray to the suffering Christ, can heal an ailing mother or save a baby girl's life?,\u201cI don\u2019t know, but after being submerged in the life of the ordinary devotees, the pastors of Quiapo are one in the feeling that they have been humbled in their priesthood the more they get to understand and encounter the faith of the simple people. From where ordinary parishioners stand, one can feel the intensity and sincerity of their devotion,\u201d Ignacio said.,He said this looks \u201csuperstitious and even fanatical\u201d to others, especially those schooled in Western theology. \u201cThe better way of expressing one's piety (is) through retreats and recollections,\u201d some would say. But Ignacio warned them against their biases.,\u201cWhether some expressions are delusional or devotional, it is the heart, the interior of the person, that will often decide if an expression is right or wrong,\u201d Ignacio explained.,He recounted the biblical story of a woman who kissed Jesus' feet and washed them with her tears \u2013 a senseless act for a Pharisee but an act of faith for Jesus. He explained: \u201cIt is only God who could see through the hearts of people.\u201d,\u201cI hope, before we make easy judgments about devotions, we must first understand why people express their faith the way they do. Those who could judge better about these acts of religiosity are those who understand fully the heart of the devotee,\u201d Ignacio added. (Watch this year's Nazarene procession below),'Purify it',Ignacio, however, admitted that the Nazarene devotion needs purification.,Some related practices, for example, go against the teachings of the Catholic Church. These include the use of amulets or black candles to bring misfortune upon other people, the use of religious icons for magic and the occult, and other forms of superstition.,Ignacio also cited those who \u201cmanipulate the devotion and use it for their own ends,\u201d such as people who claim to predict the future or sell abortion pills to the desperate.,In an interview with Rappler in 2012, anthropologist Dr Fernando Nakpil-Zialcita said the Nazarene devotion is an \u201cawesome\u201d display of gratitude to God \u2013 but is often limited to the concerns of one's family or clan. Zialcita said the challenge ,is to factor in, \u201csocial responsibility to a group larger than their family.\u201d,\u201cA Christian doesn't just show, utang na loob, (debt of gratitude) to God and forgets about one's neighbor,\u201d Zialcita explained.,It is interesting to note, for instance, that in 2012, the Nazarene procession left over 500 injured and also piles of garbage in its trail.

Rappler photo,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Senator Grace Poe used to respond to her rising survey numbers with a ,dismissive, smile and her soft laughter. Not this time.,In the wake of the release of a ,November Pulse Asia survey, showing a surge in her poll numbers, Poe said she is scared but she's not closing her doors to seeking higher office in 2016,\",S,a totoo lang, mas lalo ako nababahala. Ang trabahong 'yan ay hindi biro. Hindi 'yan para sa hindi handa. Hindi ko masasabi, pero marami kasi talagang hindi naman pinaplano 'yan,,\" ,Poe said on Wednesday, December 10. ,(The truth is, it scares me even more. The responsibility is not a joke. That job is not for those who are not prepared. I cannot really say, but things like this are not planned.),Poe added: \",Ngayon lamang ay nag-iisip akong mabuti. Hindi para sabihin na oo kung hindi para siguraduhin na kung saka-sakali ay handa ako sa anumang bagay, kahit na manatili dito sa Senado na sa tingin ko ay karangalan na para sa akin.\" ,(I'm already thinking hard about it. It is not to say yes, but to be ready for anything eventually, including the option of staying in the Senate, where it is already an honor to be in.),She said she doesn't think she's ready for the big responsibility and she's afraid of the experience of her father, the late Fernando Poe Jr, who ran in the 2004 presidential elections but was in the end betrayed by the same people who egged him on to run. ,What would persuade her to run? ,\",Ayokong sabihin ang tipping point baka kasi gawin nila,,\" she said, laughing. (I do not want to divulge my tipping point. They might do it.),Betrayal of FPJ,The latest Pulse Asia survey on preferences in the presidential race shows Poe jumping from ,10% in September ,to 18% in November 2014. This puts put her numbers closest to frontrunner Vice President Jejomar Binay, who suffered a decline ,from ,31% ,to 26%.,Poe has been eyed by some sectors to become the administration's candidate in 2016. Talk was further fueled after ,she was invited to the Liberal Party (LP) Christmas party,. ,\"Marami doon tumulong sa akin doon noong kampanya, mga galing sa probinsiya na hindi ko pa nakakausap mula noong eleksyon. S'yempre pagkakataon nang magpasalamat, pero wala talagang binanggit tungkol sa 2016. Ang pinag-usapan namin ni Presidente ay ang pelikula ng tatay ko. 'Yung isa doon, Walang Matigas na Tinapay sa Mainit na Kape,\", she said.,(Many of those who were invited to the party helped me during the campaign. They came from the provinces and I had not talked to them since the elections. Of course it was my chance to thank them, but there really was no mention of 2016. The President and I only talked about my father's movies, one of them being ,Walang Matigas na Tinapay sa Mainit na Kape,.),Based on the \"Hello, Garci\" poll controversy in 2005, ,FPJ was believed to have been cheated by Arroyo to win the 2004 presidential elections. A, wiretapped conversation shows Arroyo calling a poll commissioner to asssure her lead against Poe. ,Poe finds herself in her father's footsteps. She's being eyed to beat a frontrunner candidate in the same way that FPJ was eyed to beat then President Gloria Arroyo, who benefited from the ouster of his friend President Joseph Estrada. ,In 2005, Newsbreak also reported ,break-ins at the Batasan Pambansa to switch election returns (ERs) with fake ones to Arroyo's victory.,It was meant to cover up the massive \u2013 and messy \u2013 cheating done during the actual canvassing of votes. The ERs were the subject of an election protest filed by FPJ, who died in December 2004.,\",Siguro kakaiba lang kasi ay ang pinagdaanan ng tatay ko. 'Yun ang unang-una. Sariwa pa sa isip ko 'yun. Hindi naging madali. Maraming kaibigan sa umpisa, pero pagdating na sa pangangailangn, nawawala. Masakit 'yun,,\" she said.,(My dad went through something different. That's the foremost reason [I'm having second thoughts]. It's still fresh in my mind. It wasn't easy. There were friends at the start, but when you really needed them, they were nowhere to be found. That was painful.),She added: \",Unang-una, hindi naman talaga niya pinangarap. May mga nagtulak sa kaniya. Sa bandang huli, sila pa mismo ang sumaksak sa kaniya sa likod. Pangalawa, wala naman akong makinarya. Katulad ng tatay ko, wala akong partido. Pangatlo, sy'empre katulad ng tatay ko, hindi naman ako ganoon katagal sa gobyerno. Ang tatay ko nga wala pang, experience., Lahat 'yan makukumpara natin,,\" she said. ,(First, he didn't aspire for it. He was just egged on by some people. In the end, they were the ones who stabbed him in the back. Second, I don't have a machinery. Like my dad, I don't have a political party. Third, like my dad, I haven't been in government for long. My dad came in totally without any experience. You can compare us on all these things.) ,UNA warns Poe vs LP,Binay's United Nationalist Alliance warned Poe against the LP, however.,UNA president Toby Tiangco reminded Poe that the Vice President was the true ally of FPJ. ,\"We are truly happy for Grace, because we are the true allies and supporters of her father, the late Fernando Poe Jr. The Vice President was still Makati mayor when he was put in charge of the overall campaign management for FPJ\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign,\u201d Tiangco said in a statement on Wednesday, December 10.,Tiangco is counting on Poe to instead run for vice president, citing her statements that she may not be ready for the presidency. ,He also reminded Poe that LP was allied with Arroyo during the 2004 elections, and were therefore part of the conspiracy to cheat Poe. ,\u201cThese are the same people na nanlait kay FPJ noon. These are the same people na ayaw pabuksan ang mga Election Returns noong canvassing sa Congress. If Grace believes that her father was cheated and that caused his death, I don't know how Grace feels when she sees these faces,\u201d he added.,(These are the same people who berated FPJ then. These are the same people who prevented the opening of election returns [to prove the cheating] during canvassing in Congress.),It's like 2013 senatorial elections once again when the Liberal Party and Binay's United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) fought over FPJ's daughter. ,Poe started out as a common candidate of LP and UNA but Binay's camp eventually ,dropped her in its senatorial slate, when ,she would not commit attend UNA sorties. ,She still finished first. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/77656-poe-2016-plans", "title": "Grace Poe open to 2016 run, but haunted by betrayal of FPJ", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,https://www.rappler.com/trending/%20Special%20Program%20in%20Foreign%20Languages,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/nation/73347-grace-poe-no-2016-plans,http://www.rappler.com/nation/77528-poe-november-pulse-survey-binay"},

The President said he will announce his chosen successor after his State of the Nation Address on July 27. LP's president-on-leave Roxas is the presumptive presidential bet of the ruling party.,\u201cLahat ng dagdag-boto, inaasahan. Nandoon ang paniniwala ko na kokonsiderahin ako.

As a human rights lawyer during martial law, he supported the President's late mother Corazon \u201cCory\u201d Aquino in fighting the Marcos regime.

Justice is giving everyone their due.,My next question is something I want each of us to reflect on and relate to the concept of justice.,Do the future generations deserve the kind of climate we are leaving behind? Do our children and grandchildren deserve the Earth we are leaving behind for them?,The air that we breathe \u2013 we have polluted it to alarming levels.,Our waters \u2013 what have we done with the source of life?,Our forests have been denuded, causing more environmental disasters and leaving many species homeless.,What about our minerals that took 55 million years to form? We intend to\u2028extract these minerals in 30 to 50 years even if future generations will\u2028have nothing left.,This is how we have treated the benefits we receive from our natural resources.\u2028This is the mindset of an extractive and consumptive economics, a flawed\u2028model for progress and development.,Now we are in the face of a climate crisis. I believe we are gathered here today because we want to be part of the global effort to limit the Earth\u2019s warming and allow our communities to adapt to climactic changes that are already inevitable.,The Philippines\u2019 geographical location makes it prone to natural hazards and climate change is making it worse.,A coal power plant in Misamis Oriental. File photo courtesy STEAG State Power Inc. ,The injustice here is that the Philippines is a minor emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) with only 0.3% of global emissions, but it is among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Ketsana or Ondoy in 2009, Haiyan or Yolanda in 2013 are just a few examples.,In last year\u2019s ,climate change negotiations in Paris,, the Philippines, as chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, led the call to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C to be able to survive.,Governments conveyed the message that they are determined to act to achieve the goal of limiting the world\u2019s rise in average temperature to \u201cwell below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u201d,[1],The ,2015 Paris Agreement, is a landmark agreement in this history of humankind. However, its aspirations will not happen on its own.,Bending the global warming curve to 1.5\u00b0C is a moral imperative, because it means saving the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people; it means upholding the human rights of the poor and vulnerable; it means ensuring the integrity of our ecosystems.,The dream of a safer world needs the cooperation of all countries, and of every man, woman, and child, otherwise, we are creating our own worst nightmare.,Global warming has already breached the 1\u00b0C level with unprecedented warming in the past months. We have already borne countless tragedies and losses from recurring impacts of extreme weather events under a 1\u00b0C global warming. How much more with higher temperatures?,In fact, the 2\u00b0C warming above pre-industrial levels is no longer a prognosis but a reality. Early this month, unofficial data shows that average temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere likely exceeded2\u00b0C above normal even only for a few hours.,[2],I reckon that we are not taking part in this training exercise for the next three days to discuss the theoretical dimensions of climate realities.  Neither are we here to speak of how we have fallen short in our climate efforts over the past century.  We are here to build skills, share solutions, and to take our climate agenda to the next level.,In taking action, however, we face daunting challenges that confront us. ,Heading the list is coal.,The sustainable development-energy nexus requires an urgent examination of how we can tap on the power of innovation and new technologies to provide for the energy we need in a sustainable and inclusive manner.,In reflecting on this, I wish to invite your attention to the following facts:,Energy production accounts for two-thirds of the world\u2019s GHG emissions. The ADB projects that even by the year 2035, the majority of the region\u2019s primary energy demand will still come from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.,[3], ,Cities will not stop from growing, but they need to find more sustainable and efficient ways of providing and using energy. Economic growth and boosting energy security, however, need not compromise the world\u2019s future. ,Coal\u2019s share in CO,2 ,emissions and the power sector,The World Energy Outlook Special Report 2015 cited that over the past two-and-a-half decades, global carbon dioxide emissions increased by more than 50%.  Since 2000, the share of coal has increased from 38% to 44% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.,The annual carbon dioxide emissions of the power generation sector increased by an average of 1.2% in the last decade of the 20th century.  It has turned for the worst between 2000 and 2014, when the average annual rate of increase accelerated to 2.3%.,As so-called development loomed \u2013 with massive volumes of steel and cement being produced to build cities and industries \u2013 so did carbon dioxide emissions double from 1990 to today.,Clearly, the development we saw these past decades did not deliver us from the great economic divide that separates us from the more affluent countries. It has only drawn us closer to the menacing uncertainties of climate change. ,There is, however, one indisputable fact in all of these \u2013 the power sector has become one of the largest toxic polluters in the world.,What route is the Philippines taking?,It is projected,[5], that globally, coal will be the slowest-growing fuel in the decades to come.,It may be hard to believe, but it is happening as we have seen the diversification of the power sector away from coal in many countries.,The projections are bold \u2013 \u201cthe share of coal, after two decades of increasing in the world\u2019s energy mix, is now declining.\u201d,Coal demand will grow by only 0.8% on the average per year; with the growth accounted for by India and ASEAN.,The Philippines, regrettably, figures in this scenario.,By the year 2030, the Philippines would need an additional 13,167 megawatts of power capacity, more than half of which is expected to be generated from coal-fired power plants. In fact, 25 coal-fired power plants that have been granted Environmental Compliance Certificates are now either operational or under construction.,[6],Philippine consumption of coal has been on the upswing, which increased by 27% between 2012 and 2014.,[7],If global projections point to a decline in the share of coal in power generation, why is the Philippines taking the opposite track?,The explanation given is anchored on simplistic assumptions \u2013 coal-fired power plants are the country\u2019s dominant power technology because economically, they are widely available and easy to build.,Easy and affordable defy durable solutions. ,On the surface, one might be tempted to accept that this country\u2019s continued struggle to provide electricity to four million households eclipses the seemingly mundane discussions of climate change.  This may be so until one experiences its catastrophic impacts, with villages being washed away and thousands of young lives cut short by tsunamis.,What the \u201ceasy and affordable\u201d explanation fails to consider is the fact that there are external costs to coal, which, if considered, would render coal-fired power plants as one of the most expensive forms of power generation.  Coal-fired power plants\u2019 impacts on health, air quality, and climate, and life \u2013 above anything else \u2013 are more vital considerations.,The 150-MW AboitizPower Davao baseload power plant.

More importantly, it requires a genuine commitment to the ultimate goal of putting the Earth\u2019s and our people\u2019s survival foremost over all other concerns. ,Light is good, but life is better.,There is a dearth of studies on the health impacts of pollution from coal-fired power plants in the Philippines, but the cases studied point to the unequivocal truth \u2013 coal-fired power plants have generated health concerns in host communities.,Imagine this:,Before coal can be used in power plants, they must first be mined, washed, and transported.  This process alone, without a single watt of electricity generated yet, already produces pollution.,Coal is burned to generate electricity and its by-product, in the form of ash, is either recycled into cement or construction products, stored, or disposed in dry or wet landfills. Leakages from these landfills can contaminate ground and surface water with arsenic, cadmium, lead, just to name a few.,A documented case in Naga City, Cebu showed that from 1999 to 2004, the leading cause of death (33%) in the area, where a coal-fired power plant operated, was pneumonia;\u2028upper respiratory tract infections were the most common; and mortality and morbidity levels were much higher than national averages.,[8],The World Health Organization (WHO) concluded in 2014 that air quality in most cities worldwide \u201cfails to meet WHO guidelines for safe levels, putting people at additional risk of respiratory disease and other health problems.\u201d,[9],  This study covered 1,600 cities across 91 countries. It had attributed the air quality decline to a host of factors, including reliance on fossil fuels such as coal- fired power plants.,The United Nations estimates that 26% of global mercury emissions come from the combustion of coal in power plants.,[10],Beyond the health impacts of coal-based energy production lie the severe and irreversible impacts of climate change across the world.,Two of the major greenhouse gases contributing to climate change are produced by coal combustion \u2013 carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. As concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere accumulate, global temperature increases, setting in motion absolute consequences of climate change.,Is everything lost?,Mr. Gore\u2019s recent TED talk in Vancouver, Canada answers that question.  His talk on \u201cThe Case of Optimism on Climate Change\u201d highlights the decreasing cost associated with renewable energy and the recent agreement reached at COP 21 as reasons for a more positive outlook for the future.,Can this optimism be translated into action in the Philippines?,Switch to renewable energy,In 2008, we enacted one of the most progressive renewable energy laws in the world \u2013 offering wide range of incentives to spur the growth of the renewable energy sector.  ,The law even mandates the setting up of an RE Trust Fund that will support the development of local capacities in renewable energy development and installations.,At the time the law was enacted, people considered that renewable energy sources like wind and solar would only become a small share of the energy mix. Since then, we have seen installations increase, with hundreds of megawatts of solar and wind in excess of even the Department of Energy\u2019s targets back then. In fact, this country was the first in Southeast Asia to deploy large-scale wind and solar technologies. But we are still far away from tapping and maximizing RE\u2019s potential.,Estimates from past studies by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicate that the Philippines has 246,000 megawatts of untapped renewable energy capacity \u2013 from sun, tidal ocean power, wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydro resources.,This is thirteen times more than our current installed capacity.  Failure to develop these capacities would be unforgivable. ,Renewable energy currently accounts for 33% of the country\u2019s energy mix.,I can say we have reached considerable progress; but we cannot stop just yet. We should have a good energy mix where there is a bias for renewables.,The National Renewable Energy Program has set out aggressive targets on renewable energy development from 2011-2030, aiming to increase RE capacity to 15,304 megawatts by the year 2030.,We have the legal framework that provides the necessary policy mechanisms such as the Feed-in Tariff, Net Metering, Renewable Portfolio Standards, Green Energy Option, Renewable Energy Market, and other fiscal incentives such as income tax holiday.,There have been challenges, however, in our efforts to fast track the development of our renewable energy resources more aggressively. Impacts on electricity pricing have been a major consideration among our regulators, particularly as we already have one of the highest electricity rates in the world.,But we take note of the DOE\u2019s efforts on streamlining the Renewable Energy application process of service contracts. The agency has fast tracked the approval of pending service contracts by cutting the application process from two (2) years to forty-five (45) days.,[4],With the onset of technological innovations in energy, achieving universal access to clean energy technologies is within reach.,The government needs to focus on promoting the growth of the low-carbon economy as a means to create jobs and curb carbon emissions.,Other countries are already gaining jobs and riches from renewables. In Europe, 650,000 jobs have been created in the renewable energy sector. The US employs 75,000 citizens in the wind industry and more than 100,000 in the solar industry., ,[11],It has been found that renewables, as opposed to fossil fuel industries such as coal, often produce higher-value, better paying, cleaner, healthier jobs., ,[12],  With hundreds of thousands of untapped renewable energy resources and the legal framework to develop RE in the Philippines, renewable energy is sure to create thousands of good jobs for Filipinos.,Moreover, renewable energy is recognized as a long-term solution to the global effort to address the climate crisis. It could help mitigate the environmental impacts of our expanding energy use. ,Optimism requires action,Last December in Paris, 196 countries took a stand: \u201cDevelopment need not come at the cost of the Earth\u2019s survival.\u201d ,The top leaders of the UN climate change conference raise their hands after the approval of the Paris Agreement, at Le Bourget, France, December 12, 2015. Arnaud Bouissoi/COP21 ,Economic growth may be achieved with energy-related carbon dioxide emissions staying flat.,Countries around the world have shifted to renewable energy, accounting for nearly half of all new power generation capacity in 2014, with its cost continuing to fall.,The Philippines has committed to a 70% reduction by 2030 from business as usual scenario from energy, transport, waste, industry and forestry. We also committed to building the resilience of our communities and promoting inclusive growth in accordance with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals.,We now enter a new era of development pursuits which challenges us to do more, to do better, and to be more innovative. Delivering on our commitments to these global frameworks is our way of telling and showing the world that though we are vulnerable, we are not incapable.,As a legislator, I will make sure that this happens.,In the upcoming 17th Congress, I will introduce an energy efficiency bill as part of our country\u2019s decarbonization effort.,We will monitor the level of implementation and compliance with various laws that promote decarbonization, including the Clean Air Act; the Renewable Energy Act; and the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act. ,We will track compliance with equally important laws that help us prepare for climate realities, including the Clean Water Act; Climate Change Act; the Environmental Awareness and Education Act; the People\u2019s Survival Fund Law, and the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act.,We will push for the progressive reduction of least-efficient coal-fired power plants and will work towards\u2028banning their construction. \u2028,Although the Philippines is not a major emitter of GHG, we cannot let our economy grow through the ways that caused today\u2019s climate crisis; we cannot let human society live in a world fraught with dangers. ,A new movement for climate action,Creative approaches are needed for the problems we have at hand.,A novel and revolutionary movement was hatched by a group of deeply committed  environmental thinkers and doers.  This movement will seek for an an advisory opinion before the International Court of Justice  (ICJ) on the question:,\u201c,Under international law, what are the duties of States to protect humankind of the present and  future generations  from the climate crisis,?\u201d,The legal action will not be adversarial; but would seek the advice of the world\u2019s court on a question of law.  The challenge rests in getting the UN General Assembly to issue a resolution, requesting the ICJ to issue an advisory opinion on this question.,Global and massive social mobilization effort would be needed to convince governments to support this initiative. Let us utilize the latest in information technology to reach out to our governments and to convince them to support a proposed Resolution that will seek this advisory opinion from the ICJ.,Friends, the situation we are in requires urgent, massive, and effective action.  Let us all be involved.,The world is not just about us. There is a future and resources need to be protected and conserved for those who will be born beyond our time.,It is clear injustice to let future generations suffer the irreversible consequences of our irresponsible actions.,The climate crisis presents the opportunity to promote green growth for the sake of the only planet we call home, for the sake of our children and our children\u2019s children, and for our own survival.,We should act to protect the Earth not just with a sense of urgency, rather with a sense of great emergency.,Thank you. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,[1], ,The Paris Agreement,, Conference of Parties 21.

Photo by Lito Boras/Rappler     ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman Andres Bautista said the poll body aims to transmit 90% of votes from more than 90,000 vote-counting machines this year.,This is the same transmission rate in the 2010 presidential elections.,Poor Internet signals and the geography of the Philippines' 7,107 islands will prevent the Comelec from transmitting 100% of votes for the May 9 elections, Bautista explained.,Bautista said the 90% target is a far cry from the 76% transmission rate in 2013.,He explained why it's difficult to achieve a 100% transmission rate.,\"Puwede naman. Why not, \u2018di ba? Pero ako, malamang mahihirapan,,\" Bautista said Monday, April 25. (It could be. Why not, right? But for me, it might be difficult.) ,Bautista, former law dean of Far Eastern University, however pointed out that 90% is good enough for \u201cfirst honors.\u201d,\u201c,Kasi ang first honors, 90%, masaya na ako e,,\u201d he said. (Because first honors would be 90%, I will be happy.),This comes after the Comelec on April 23 tested the transmission of votes from polling precincts to canvassing centers across the Philippines.,Poor signal a problem,In this mock canvassing, the Comelec ,managed to transmit, 100% of votes from across the country.,Asked why the Comelec can transmit only 90% of votes after the May 9 elections when it relayed 100% of votes from VCMs last April 23, Bautista pointed out that the transmission test on April 23 involved only 20 areas in the Philippines.,On the other hand, the May 9 elections will involve 92,509 polling precincts.,\u201c,So by way of percentages, siyempre bumababa,,\u201d the elections chief said. (So by way of percentages, of course it becomes lower.),Besides poor Internet signals, he also cited other factors such as weather and even the positioning of the machines. ,Bautista said the Comelec, in any case, is already anticipating and addressing these problems.,One thing they will do is to meet with telecommunications companies.,He said the Comelec wants to request telcos to prioritize data to be transmitted by the Comelec after 5 pm on May 9.,He said of the telcos, \"They have been very cooperative.\",'No vote disregarded',The Philippines\u2019 VCMs were manufactured by Smartmatic, the same Venezuelan company behind the country\u2019s voting machines in its first two automated polls in 2010 and 2013.,Smartmatic voters\u2019 education head Karen Jimeno explained the transmission process during the transmission test on April 23.,Jimeno said that on election day, election results will be transmitted directly from VCMs to canvassing centers as soon as the voting period ends.,Jimeno said that if electronic transmission fails, the SD memory cards containing the election results \"are manually delivered to the appropriate board of canvasser for consolidation and canvassing.\",Jimeno, a lawyer, added in a text message to Rappler: \"No vote is disregarded. All votes are required by law to be counted in order to proclaim the winners.\",The head of the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), for her part, said she hopes the Comelec will address a number of transmission problems seen in 2013.,One of these problems is permitting the manual or physical transfer of USBs containing election results to the \"next transmission level\", which means municipal or provincial canvassing centers.,PPCRV Chairperson Henrietta de Villa said, \",Kung physical transfer, parang that defeats the automation purpose.

The Philippines, already suffering from some of the worst impacts of climate change, has to act now, according to green groups after the release of IPCC's Fifth Assessment report on the status of climate change,MANILA, Philippines - A wake-up call.,That's how Voltaire Alferez, national coordinator of the Aksyon Klima Pilipinas, thinks Filipinos should see the ,just-released Fifth Assessment Report,, a report on climate change compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).,The 2,000-page document, revealed to the world last September 27, is the first volume of compiled findings of thousands of peer-reviewed journals on the status and impacts of climate change, a global phenomenon in which the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to an increase in global temperature.,READ: Climate Change Commission unveils first climate change map,The voluminous report affirmed that human activites are causing of global warming, with the panel rating its certainty at 95%. The last report in 2007 said the panel was 90% convinced.,It predicted that world temperatures would rise by 0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius (, (0.5-8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century. Sea levels are projected to rise between ,26 and 82 centimeters (10.4 and 32.8 inches).,There will also be an increase in heatwaves, floods and droughts, warned the report.,The worst-case scenario predicted shows temperatures rising to ,4.8\u00baC (8.6\u00baF), a figure many experts call catastrophic. The United Nations targetted 2,\u00baC as the maximum level at which the world can avoid the worst impacts of climate change.,The Philippines must act now,But despite the massiveness of the report and its implications, Aksyon Klima Pilipinas, a national network of organizations working on climate and development issues, says the report should translate to domestic action in the Philippines.,\u201cFilipinos already feel the impacts of climate change...The national government must allocate programmed funds for the People\u2019s Survival Fund and convene the board to help local governments adapt.,\"It must stop paying lip service to renewable energy in the climate action plan and rethink its plan to build more coal plants. Finally, it must now undertake the climate-proofing of our local development plans to ensure that our communities are resilient to the effects of climate change,\u201d he said in a statement.,READ: Are we ready for another Ondoy?,Meanwhile, Worldwide Fund for Nature CEO Lory Tan said the IPCC report must drive home the point that Filipinos have to adapt to climate change now, even if the country is not a major contributor to climate change.,\"Whether or not the Philippines is responsible for what the IPCC report confirms, we will get hit. And, we will get hit hard. Extreme rainfall, intense storms, sea level rise. We know this already. How do we respond to this change?\" he said.,\"Business as usual will no longer cut it. We need to mainstream next practice.\",He added that the country must veer away from fossil fuel-derived energy. The combustion of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gas. From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in 1750 until 2012, the burning of fossil fuels led to a 40% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.,There are 3 solar power plants under construction in the Philippines, he told Rappler. The government and private sector must invest in more renewable energy sources like these to meet the effects of climate change head on.,\"The same applies to the way we manage water supply and water quality. We need to diversify our water supply sources,\" he said in relation to the threat of more droughts in the future.,Tony La Vi\u00f1a, environmentalist and dean of Ateneo de Manila University's School of Government said on Facebook, \"My first impression is that the science has greatly improved, uncertainties have been narrowed, climate change is definitely worsening, the scenarios are bleak but there are options we can still take to avoid worst case scenarios. The main message is: act now.\",Dominant views,But he observed with worry the \",overwhelming dominance of scientists from the North or developed countries\" in the list of drafting and draft contributing authors of the report.,He noted that that while 31 of the drafting authors come from developed countries, only 3 are from developing countries. In the draft contributing authors list, 35.5 are from developed countries while 1.5 are from developing countries. The 0.5 is because one of the authors hails from Australia and Brazil. ,\"I worry that this dominance will be used to undermine what I think is a good, solid report,\" he said.,\"In view, even in scientific matters, it matters where you come from and the perspective you bring as that is still a filter you use in making conclusions. This is especially important when issues like historical responsibility and carbon budgets are addressed.\",The full, detailed report will be released on Monday, September 30.

Dari tes tersebut diduga T.O.P pernah mengonsumsi mariyuana Oktober 2016 lalu. Namun tidak dijelaskan apakah ia masih menggunakannya hingga kini. Yang jelas, April lalu, T.O.P pernah diserahkan ke pihak berwajib untuk diproses terkait kepemilikan dan konsumsi mariyuana ini.,Menurut keterangan polisi, T.O.P mengonsumsi mariyuana di rumahnya di Seoul Oktober silam dengan seorang wanita. Polisi baru mengetahui fakta ini di bulan Maret saat T.O.P menjalani serangkaian pemeriksaan di masa wajib militer. Saat itu tes menunjukkan hasil bahwa T.O.P positif mengonsumsi mariyuana. Tapi T.O.P sempat membantah kala itu dengan menyebut bahwa dirinya menghisap rokok elektrik.,Sementara itu, YG Entertainment, manajemen artis yang membawahi T.O.P baru saja merilis pernyataan mereka yang mengatakan bahwa pihaknya meminta maaf atas beredarnya kabar ini.,\"Setelah mengonfirmasi langsung dengan T.O.P, kami mengonfirmasi bahwa selama masa wajib militernya, dia pernah diperiksa terkait dugaan konsumsi mariyuana.

AFP / Dimitar Dilkoff,STOCKHOLM, Sweden (3rd UPDATE) \u2013 A UN panel said Friday, September 27, it was more certain than ever that humans were the cause of global warming and predicted temperatures would rise another 0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius (0.5-8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.,The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also projected sea levels would rise between 26 and 82 centimeters (10.4 and 32.8 inches) by 2100, and warned of a higher risk for heatwaves, floods and droughts.,Environmental activists and scientists said the first volume of the panel's long-awaited review, released in Stockholm, made it clearer than ever that Man's fossil-fuel burning must be urgently curbed to limit future damage to the climate system.,In a report summary, the Nobel-winning group said it was \"extremely likely\" \u2013 a term meaning it was 95% convinced \u2013 that humans caused more than half the warming observed over the past 60 years.,In its last report in 2007, the panel had rated its conviction at 90%.,UN climate chief Christiana Figueres said the report's release was \"an alarm clock moment for the world.\",\"To steer humanity out of the high danger zone, governments must step up immediate climate action and craft an agreement in 2015 that helps to scale up\" efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, she said.,And US Secretary of State John Kerry also urged strong action, labeling the report \"yet another wakeup call.\",\"Those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire,\" he said in a statement.,Trilogy of reports,NEW CLIMATE REPORT. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon addresses the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) via video link as they present the first volume of its Fifth Assessment Report, on September 27, 2013 in Stockholm. AFP/Jonathan Nackstrand,The IPCC document is the first volume in a trilogy summarizing the status of global warming and its impacts.,The panel has delivered four previous assessment reports in its 25-year history.,Each edition has pounded out an ever-louder drumbeat to warn that temperatures are rising and the risk to the climate system \u2013 in drought, floods, storms and rising seas \u2013 is accentuating.,The panel's projections for 2100 are based on computer models of trends in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, especially from coal, oil and gas, which provide the backbone of energy supply today.,The most optimistic of four warming scenarios sees an average temperature rise of 1.0\u00baC (1.8\u00baF) by 2100 over 2000 levels, ranging from 0.3 to 1.7\u00baC (0.5-3.1\u00baF). This is the only scenario that can safely meet a UN target of 2\u00baC (3.6\u00baF) which also factors in warming from the start of the Industrial Revolution to 2000.,By comparison, the highest IPCC scenario has an average warming this century of 3.7\u00baC (6.7\u00baF), ranging from 2.6\u00baC (4.7\u00baF) to a 4.8\u00baC (8.6\u00baF) \u2013 a figure many experts consider catastrophic.,\"Global surface temperature change for the 21st century is projected to be likely to exceed 1.5\u00baC relative to 1850-1900 in all but the lowest scenario considered,\" said Thomas Stocker, co-chairman of the IPCC working group that authored the report.,Working Group I Contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report,: ,Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, Summary for Policymakers,'Unbiased assessments' of climate change,Heatwaves were \"very likely\" to occur more frequently and last longer, he said, with added risk of floods and droughts in a warmer world.,According to World Meteorological Organization chief Michel Jarraud, the report underscored that \"our activities today will have a profound effect on society, not just for us but for many generations to come\".,The decade ending 2010 had already been the warmest on record, and was marked by extreme weather events.,\"We ignore these scientific warnings at our own peril,\" said Andrew Steer, head of the World Resources Institute, a US-based think tank.,\"Climate change is here and it's advancing even faster than we realized. Human activities are at the core of it.\",In a video statement, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the report was \"essential\" for governments thrashing out an ambitious global deal by 2015 on curbing greenhouse gas emissions.,Ban will host a summit in September 2014 to boost political commitment to containing warming to 2.0,\u00ba,C \u2013 the level at which experts say we can avoid some of the worst climate fallout.,\"The heat is on,\" said the UN chief. \"Now we must act.\",Political interest in climate change dwindled after a near-disastrous UN summit in Copenhagen in 2009, and willingness for concessions has fallen back in developed countries still struggling from the 2008 financial crisis.,The work released Friday comprises a 2,000-page report authored by 257 scientists, plus a 36-page Summary for Policymakers.,Two more volumes will be released next year. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/40020-ipcc-5th-assessment-report-released", "title": "Warmer Earth, humans to blame \u2013 UN panel", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161465-pagasa-defends-scientists-amid-project-noah-takeover,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson"},

Or is his political base slowly getting eroded?,The latest Pulse Asia nationwide survey obtained by Rappler shows Binay shedding off an additional 5 percentage points in the presidential race \u2013 from ,31% in September, to 26% in November 2014.,Office of the Vice President's (OVP) Media Affairs head Joey Salgado downplayed the survey results, saying the 5% decline \"is marginal, according to Pulse Asia.\",The survey had 1,200 respondents with a ,\u00b1,3 margin of error. It was conducted from November 14-20 and listed 14 names for respondents to choose from. On the other hand, the September survey had 15 potential presidential candidates.,At the time of the survey, Binay had just ,backed out from a scheduled debate, with Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, preferring instead to barnstorm around the country.,The Vice President has been battered with allegations of corruption during his term as Makati mayor. His former ally, former ,Makati vice mayor Ernesto Mercado,, has been unleashing one expos\u00e9 after another \u2013 from ,hidden bank accounts, to alleged ,kickbacks from overpriced construction projects, and ,alleged ill-gotten wealth,. He has alleged that ,these anomalies are perpetuated by the Binay dynasty in Makati.,Salgado brushed these aside, saying the results are \"welcome news because the survey was taken at a time when the VP's detractors were aggressively throwing mud against him in the Senate and in media.\" He added that Trillanes' boast that in this survey Binay's numbers would drop by 10 points or more did not happen.,\"For us, it means that the people have seen through the motives of the senators who style themselves as presidentiables. The people have seen the absence of substance behind the posturing and drama. The people are also telling the senators to stop the mudslinging and attend to the more pressing needs of the country,\" Salgado said in a text message.,Drops among social classes,The survey results showed that Binay suffered his biggest setback in Luzon, dropping 10 percentage points, from 32 in September, to 22 in November.,He dropped 4 points in Metro Manila, and 3 points in Mindanao. He gained 1 point in the Visayas region. Binay has been going around the provinces there.,Among social classes, Binay sustained drops across the board. He shed off 5 points among ABC; 6 points among D and 3 points among E. The D and E, comprising the majority of voters, are considered the bailiwick of Binay\u2019s votes. ,Still, if the elections were to be held today, Binay would win by a plurality. ,But the gap has narrowed.,Grace Poe's gain,Surging from the Pulse Asia November survey is neophyte Senator Grace Poe-Llamanzares, who jumped from ,10% ,to 18%.,Poe, daughter of the late action star Fernando Poe Jr, posted substantial increases across the board. From 10 points and 9 points in NCR and Luzon, she leap-frogged to 19 points and 20 points, respectively. In Mindanao, she advanced from 8 to 19 points. In the Visayas however, she lost 1 point, from 14% to 13%.,Among social classes, Poe posted double digits across the board: 17 points among the ABC, 20 points among the D, and 15 points among the E. In the September survey, she managed 9 points among the ABC, 12 points among the D, and 6 points among the E.,Significantly, Poe is in a tie with Binay among the ABC, and is within striking distance in Luzon.,By deduction, and based on the numbers of the other potential presidential candidates, it appears Poe is the biggest beneficiary of Binay\u2019s decline in numbers.,Poe has ,balked at seeking the presidency,, but certain quarters are ,pushing for a Poe-Leni Robredo tandem in 2016,.,Other highlights,Other highpoints of the survey:,Others in the list were:,VP race,In the vice-presidential race, Poe retained the top spot as the preferred choice, followed by Escudero and Cayetano.

Yet LP members also want her to either be the standard-bearer of the administration party, or the vice presidential candidate of Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II. ,One thing is clear. Poe said she and Escudero will not run against each other. The two are close friends, and do not belong to a political party. ,For now, Escudero said he has not yet made up his mind on whether to run for a higher post. ,\u201c,Ako, wala pa ring desisyon o plano kaugnay ng pagtakbo sa 2016.

Vice President Jejomar Binay might resign from the Aquino Cabinet before the filing of certificates of candidacy in October. File photo by Ryan Lim/Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 Vice President Jejomar Binay resigned from the Aquino Cabinet on ,Monday, June 22,. ,One month before his resignation, Rappler already reported that Binay was likely to resign even before the filing of certificates of candidacy in October, and before President Benigno Aquino III chooses an administration candidate. ,Calls for Binay to vacate his posts as housing czar and presidential adviser on Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) concerns began since his buddies-turned-accusers exposed one ,corruption scandal, after another, and filed ,plunder complaints, against him last year. ,Sources from the Binay camp told Rappler the reasons for his resignation have more to do with politics than answering graft accusations. ,'UNTENABLE POSITION.' UNA interim secretary general JV Bautista says Binay will be in an awkward position when Aquino endorses the administration candidate. File photo by Gil Nartea/Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau  ,'The awkward, odd man out' ,Binay sat in meetings of the Aquino Cabinet while heading the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) whose members routinely criticize the administration. This unique arrangement led allies of President Benigno Aquino III in the ruling Liberal Party (LP) to call Binay \u201c,two-faced,\u201d and \u201chypocritical.\u201d,UNA interim secretary general JV Bautista said resignation has long been a possibility for Binay. ,\u201cHe's really not part of the political party where most, if not practically all of those serving the Cabinet are members. So he seems to be the odd man out. At some point, it really becomes intolerable, especially when the political climate heats up,\u201d Bautista told Rappler. , ,Difference in Binay's stand on admin issues ,He added: \u201cIt's untenable in the sense that he is still in the Cabinet and a declared candidate, and the President will be supporting someone else, it's going to be awkward.\u201d ,The President is set to ,name the administration's standard bearer, after his State of the Nation Address on July 27, making the period key for political parties and politicians finalizing plans for 2016. ,A partymate of Binay said the the Vice President's call was a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d based on \u201cgut feel.\u201d ,The group was initially torn about their patron resigning before October. Those in favor of early resignation believe Binay might lose \u201cpolitical gravitas\u201d in the sure event that Aquino anoints another successor, either Interior Secretary ,Mar Roxas, of the LP or independent ,Senator Grace Poe. ,Besides saving face, another factor behind Binay's possible resignation is that the move will allow him to directly criticize the Aquino administration. ,\u201cHe will not be burdened by having to answer as an alter ego of the President,\u201d Bautista said. ,Years before the polls, Binay already distanced himself from Aquino, creating his ,own Senate slate in 2013,, and questioning the lack of ,inclusive growth,, particularly unemployment and poverty. (READ: ,Binay and the politics of firsts,),Even on foreign policy, Binay does not toe the official line. He backs a ,joint venture with China, for oil and gas exploration in the disputed South China Sea while Aquino approved a ,historic legal case ,against Beijing's expansive claims. ,A member of Binay's inner circle said that the Vice President wanted to speak up about the ,government's handling, of the January 25 ,Mamasapano clash, that killed 67 Filipinos including 44 police Special Action Force (SAF) members. It was a major security and political crisis that ,pulled down, Aquino's popularity. (READ: ,Binay keeps mum on Aquino's role in Mamasapano,),\u201cVP Binay felt hurt on how the SAF 44 and the survivors were treated, that they were even the ones blamed. He wanted to openly speak out but he just kept quiet because he didn't want to add to the problems of the President. He did not want to leave the President at his lowest moment. That was the height of the thought of resignation,\u201d the source said. ,Publicly, Binay then only said \u201cthere can be no peace without justice,\u201d and ,warned against, rushing the passage of the Bangsamoro Basic Law, a priority, legacy measure of Aquino as part of the peace process with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.,MAKATI AID. The Binays give financial assistance from the city of Makati to families of the SAF 44. The VP's allies say the handling of the Mamasapano clash made him think of resigning from the Cabinet. File OVP photo  ,'Loyal opposition' no more ,What happens now that Binay resigned?,Political science professor Allen Surla of De La Salle University told Rappler that there will be no significant impact on governance. He said it would have been different had Binay bagged plum posts like the interior, and transportation and communications portfolios that Roxas got. ,\u201cThe positions Binay holds are not administratively tedious but they reach out to the poorer segment of society. What's the number one problem of Filipinos? Housing. That has a lot of photo ops and media mileage but he already optimized that. He has name recall. Now, he's got everyone either for him or against him. There's no middle ground. It's love or hate,\u201d Surla said.,Fierce Binay critic Senator Antonio Trillanes IV wanted Binay out of the housing sector, accusing him of using his influence for his friends to ,corner development loans.  ,The effect of resignation is political. Bautista said that while UNA called itself a \u201c,loyal opposition,\u201d to Aquino in 2013, this time around, the party draws the line. ,\u201cWe are no longer 'Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition' like in the UK. We are now ,the, opposition but the behavior of this opposition is not old politics centered on character assassination like the Villaroyo and Topak,\u201d Bautista said in reference to black propaganda against Aquino and former Senator Manuel Villar Jr in the 2010 polls. ,It remains unclear if Binay will speak against Aquino himself, considering family ties and debt of gratitude. The former Makati mayor owes his political break to the President's late mother Corazon who appointed him officer-in-charge of the city during her presidency in 1986. ,Personal relations and having the two highest officials from opposing parties characterize the oddity that is Philippine politics. ,In countries like the United States and Indonesia, presidents and vice presidents are voted from the same party with similar ideologies. A heartbeat away from the presidency, ,America's VP ,also acts as president of the Senate, and influences legislation. ,Surla believes there is merit to the Philippine system. \u201cIf the president is abusive and you have a strong vice president, he could be the voice. But if they are partners and they are both corrupt, the vice president will sign the same tune. It's good to have a balance.\u201d ,'OPTIMIZING MILEAGE.' DLSU Political science professor Allen Surla says Binay already made the most out of the media mileage in his housing and OFW posts. File photo from Binay's Facebook page  ,Unofficial campaigning ,Binay will remain vice president, but no longer a Cabinet member.

Climate change maps like the one crafted for Cagayan de Oro can beef up disaster-preparedness and climate change adaptiveness for the entire Philippines. All photos by Pia Ranada/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines - At the September 13 budget hearing of the ,Climate Change Commission,, Secretary Mary Ann Lucille Sering unveiled a climate change map of Cagayan de Oro, one of the most disaster-prone cities in the country. ,The 3-dimensional map is \"the first of its kind in the Philippines,\" according to Sering, and was finished within a record span of 6 months with the help of the local government, the Department of Science and Technology, National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) and Project NOAH.,Attached to the Office of the President, the Climate Change Commission is the government's policy-making body tasked with coordinating and evaluating climate change programs and action plans.,Unlike geohazard maps which document only the geology, landforms and slopes of a particular area, climate change maps plot out impacts of climactic event factors like rainfall, humidity, chances of erosion, ground water potential and soil texture, among others.,Specifically, the CDO climate change map foresees what will happen to the province when besieged by a storm in 2020 and 2050 given the compounding effects of climate change. ,\"This is the first map of its kind that factors in climate change scenarios by 2020 and 2050. This is an actual flood map of Cagayan de Oro,\" explained Sering.,Wonder map,In 2011, more than a thousand people died when flashfloods submerged CDO during Tropical Storm Sendong. But information provided by the climate change map can stop flashfloods from ever happening again, said Sering.,The map identifies areas most vulnerable to flooding measured by gradience in color\u2013the darker the hue, the deeper the flood in the area. ,It can help local government units and private citizens know when relocation is necessary. If the storm will only flood in the area, only proper flood control is needed and not necessarily relocation. But if the map shows the area is vulnerable to soil erosion and landslides, recommendations for relocation can be made even before the storm hits and lives are lost.,MORE THAN DISASTERS. Climate Change Commission Secretary Mary Ann Lucille Sering says climate change is not just about disasters and typhoons,It can also measure the effectiveness of infrastructure projects meant to alleviate flooding.,\"If we now factor in, for example, drainage system, we will run this again and we will see how it will be reduced,\" Sering explained.,By identifying upstream areas where rainwater run-off contributes to the swelling of rivers, the map can help the Department of Environment and Natural Resources identify where to concentrate their reforestation efforts.,\"The map allows CDO to identify in a much clearer way the investment and infrastructure it needs to mitigate the effects of climate change.\",Similar maps are being crafted for Iligan, Tuguegarao and Iloilo, added Sering. They hope to replicate the project for the entire country. A climate change map is available for Metro Manila but it was based solely on historical data. The agency hopes to make a more updated version.,Maps that factor in wind velocity are being made for Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental.,\"It will now give them an idea, for example, of whether they should still be planting bananas, assuming the wind velocity would be stronger than it is. We didn't have this before. We would just plant wherever it suited us. But with these tools, we are now putting into context what our investments should be.\",'Not all about disasters',But Sering emphasized that climate change is not just about disasters. The country has to prepare for other alarming impacts of climate change.,\"We have no idea what an increase in temperature will do to our food security. In areas that we went to, local communities have already cited incidents where there crops are decreasing or wilting. Aside from human activities like overfishing, they're seeing a reduction in fish yield. We do not have thorough studies on this yet. The Department of Agriculture has been targeting production without looking at the impact of weather and the increase in temperature.\",She added that for 2013, the agency will focus on providing technical advice services to local governments so they can help communities adapt to all foreseen impacts of climate change. ,- Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/39057-climate-change-commission-cdo-map", "title": "Climate Change Commission unveils first climate change map", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment"},

Transfer at the earliest possible time in Batangas or somewhere there,\u201d he said.,The concentration of activities at the Manila port is a major contributing factor to traffic in Metro Manila, with trucks going all over the mega-city to and from the port.,On airports,As for airport infrastructure, Duterte said the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) can no longer handle the current number of flights. (READ: ,NAIA among 'high-risk' airports in Asia-Pacific \u2013 global airlines,),\u201cAll the airplanes going to Manila are concentrated there so how can you arrive on time when at any given time there are about 30 passenger airplanes waiting to make the final approach to land? There\u2019s no infrastructure,\u201d he said.,His solution would be to make more use of Clark International Airport as an alternative airport and then build a fast train to deliver goods and commuters to Metro Manila.,\u201cYou have to have a fast train with two points of entry somewhere in Metro Manila that is not too crowded,\u201d he elaborated.,On traffic jams,Duterte also said traffic on EDSA and everywhere else in the metro is because of \u201cdaily transactions of motor vehicles\u201d and policies like number coding which merely encourage rich families to buy more cars.,To ease traffic jams, he said he would improve public transportation by buying 30 or 50 more train carriages. This way, people would not have to endure long lines.

Photo from Malacanang Photo Bureau, ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED as of 8:05 p.m.) - President Aquino called on Filipinos to exercise \"maximum vigilance and discipline\" leading up to and during the Black Nazarene procession on Monday, Jan. 9, 2012, as a necessary precaution over reported \"heightened risk.\",In a briefing on Sunday, the president confirmed a terror threat on the annual Catholic event in Quiapo that attracts ,eight to nine million devotees, from all over the country.,\"I am sad that terrorists want to disrupt ability of people to live their lives, including freedom to worship and other community activities,\" President Aquino said.,\"In the last few months, we have been apprised of intentions to create disruptions in the NCR (National Capital Region) during the feast of the Black Nazarene. Previously the difference between their intentions and capabilities has been quite pronounced. The possibility prompts us to warn you of the risk in attending the procession,\" he said.,Aquino said the group involved is local, but their linkage to other groups, such as the Abu Sayyaf and Jema'ah Islamiyah, has yet to be established.,President Aquino stressed that \"the state will protect the devotees to the fullest extent possible,\" but asked for understanding and cooperation among those who will attend the religious rite since increased security preparations and measures will be in place., ,DEVOTION. From all walks of life, devotees carry the Black Nazarene on their shoulders.,No cellphones, firecrackers,Attendees are not allowed to bring cell phones, as well as weapons, firecrackers and pyrotechnic devices to avoid injuries and to prevent panic and stampede., ,\"Anyone who is caught bringing or using fireworks will be apprehended. Monitor and  obey our warnings and instructions. This is for the safety and well being of all,\" President Aquino said.,In a statement also on Sunday, National Police Chief Nicanor Bartolome said they have placed the entire 15,000-strong police force in Metro Manila on full alert as part of a comprehesive security and public safety plan.\",Initially, only 2,000 police authorities were deployed for the procession. The Armed Forces of the Philippines would augment the increased deployment of police personnel and all available mobile and foot patrol units as well as K-9 Units will be deployed, Bartolome added.,Unruly persons and those under the influence of drugs and alcohol will be immediately evicted from the activity, according to Manila Police Director Senior Supt. Alex Gutierrez.,Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo also advised against bringing big bags as these will have to be searched. Vehicle owners are also asked to clear the street parking along the procession route to avoid any forced removal.,There are no classes in schools located in the Manila area on Monday.,US warning,On Sunday morning, Jan. 8, 2012, Deputy Spokesperson Abigail Valte made the same appeal to the Black Nazarene devotees. A few hours after, it was President Aquino himself who decided to address the public following a cancelled Davao trip and a late morning briefing by Police Chief Bartolome at the Command Center in Quiapo.,The president said this terror threat is not related to the ,travel advisory, issued by the US Embassy in Manila last Friday, January 6, 2012. Their advisory came on the same the day the country branding campaign, \",It's more fun in the Philippines,,\" was launched in a bid to attract more tourists to visit the country.,\"There is no connection between their terrorist advisory and the discovery,\" he said, adding that the latter is part of an \"ongoing effort as early as August of last year.\",The US ,advisory, came a day after a video of a kidnapped Australian who was ,appealing, for help, was leaked to on January 5. Australian ,Warren Richard Rodwell, was abducted last Dec. 5, 2011, in Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay.,The US and Australia are key security allies in the region.,The Palace have previously ,downplayed travel advisories, issued by US, Australia, United Kingdom, France, New Zealand at Canada for warning their citizens of threat.,A Camp Aguinaldo source said the intelligence community started receiving reports about the threats early last week, \"including plans and actual movements.\" He said the threat was coming from fundamentalist groups.,But there's no need to raise the alarm level, he added.,One of the President's senior intelligence advisers clarified to Rappler that the President just \"did not want to leave anything to chance.\", ,He explained: \"These are the same sort of reports we receive annually during this feast day. So far, in the last several years, nothing came out of these threats. But we never leave anything to chance.\",No cancellation, ,President Aquino said that the probability of an attack during the Feast of the Black Nazarene has not increased dramatically enough for the government to seek the cancellation of the observance.,\"If there was a very high risk of that (bomb attack), we would have moved to cancel the procession.

'Toby, don't interfere in that issue,' he supposedly told him.    ,'NO IDEA.' Vice President Jejomar Binay distances himself from his party president's attack on Senator Grace Poe. File photo from the Office of the Vice President ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 His close ally and party president questioned the residency qualifications of Senator Grace Poe, but Vice President Jejomar Binay claims to have no idea of the political gambit. ,Binay said he was \u201csurprised\u201d that Navotas Representative Tobias \u201cToby\u201d Tiangco was going to hold a press conference to say that Poe was ,not qualified, to run for higher office in 2016. The opposition's 2013 campaign manager, Tiangco said that Poe failed to meet the 10-year residency requirement for a presidential or vice presidential candidate.,Binay, chairman and founder of the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), said he was aware of the legal issue but not of Tiangco's announcement.  ,\u201c,Matagal ko nang alam iyan. Mga one month or two months ago, sinabi sa akin ni Toby iyan. Sabi ko sa kanya, 'Toby, huwag ka nang makialam diyan. Pabayaan mo na lang ang iba ang magsabi niyan,,'\u201d Binay said in an interview with Bombo Radyo Manila on Wednesday, June 3.,(I knew of this a long time ago. Maybe one month or two months ago, Toby told me about that. I told him, \u201cToby, don't interfere in that issue. Let others be the one to say that.\") ,The opposition's standard-bearer said he cannot explain why Tiangco decided to hold the press briefing supposedly without his consent. ,\u201c,So eh, kagabi eh, nagulat ako. May nagsabi sa akin sinabi ni Toby ganito-ganito. Sa bagay hong iyan, kung bakit ho nasabi ni Toby eh 'tanong ninyo na lamang ho sa kanya. Pero ako mismo, sinabihan ko si Toby, 'Toby, huwag ka nang makialam diyan.' Kasi alam ko na na kahit papaano siyempre kandidato ka eh, hahanapan at hahanapan ka ng issue,,\u201d he added.,(So last night, I was shocked. Someone told me that Toby said this and that. On this matter, why not just ask Toby why he said that? As for me, I told Toby, \u201cToby, don't meddle with that.\u201d Because I know that, of course, people will always find issues against candidates.) ,Senator Nancy Binay, Binay's eldest daughter and a member of UNA, said that she, too, was surprised by Tiangco's statement. ,\u201cI had nothing to do with it. In fact, ,napanood ko na lang siya noong nakauwi ako, na parang, 'Oh my God, ganoon pala 'yung sinabi ni Cong. Toby!'\u201d ,(I just saw the press conference when I got home, and I was like, \u201cOh my God, that's what Cong. Toby said!),Tiangco: I did not ask permission ,Tiangco told Rappler that he deliberately did not ask permission from the Vice President, and is ready to face the consequences of his actions. He said that Binay asked him about his press conference but did not scold him. ,\"I do not need to ask permission from my boss to defend him from attackers. ,Sinasaksak ang boss ko, kailangan ko pa bang magpaalam na ipagtanggol ang boss ko?,\" (They are already stabbing my boss. Do I still need to ask permission to defend him?) ,Tiangco said that he only wanted to defend his political patrons after Poe criticized Binay and former President now Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada over corruption allegations against them. Poe said that she ,does not want to run, with the two UNA stalwarts because she wanted to campaign against corruption.  ,\u201cDoesn't Grace emphasize honesty? Then she should be honest about her qualifications,\u201d Tiangco said.,Tiangco held a press briefing on Tuesday at the House of Representatives, where he showed a copy of Poe's 2013 certificate of candidacy (COC). The congressman said that the document showed Poe was not qualified to run for higher office because she would have lived in the Philippines for only 9 years and 6 months by the May 9, 2016, polls. ,Poe held her ,own press conference, on Wednesday, where she stood by her qualifications. She boldly asked UNA: \u201c,Sa totoo lang, bakit kayo natatakot sa akin?,\u201d (Honestly, why are you threatened by me?) ,The senator is reported to be a viable challenger to Binay due to her strong survey showing. ,Recent surveys placed her second to Binay, but she has yet to declare any political plans.,Legal experts also criticized Tiangco, saying jurisprudence and the legal doctrine of ,animus revertendi ,or the intent to return disproved his argument. ,Lawyers cited the case of former First Lady Imelda Marcos, whom the Supreme Court allowed to run for Leyte representative in 1995 as she was a resident of the province even if she lived in different places prior to the polls.,Binay: I won't do that to a woman,Pressed about Tiangco's statements, Vice President Binay sought to further distance himself from his political lieutenant's pronouncements. ,\u201c,Ayaw ko hong makisawsaw diyan, and unang-una mahal ko pa rin ho si FPJ,,\u201d Binay said in reference to Poe's late father, actor Fernando Poe Jr. (I don't want to meddle with that, because, first, I still love FPJ.) ,Binay added that it is best that voters get to choose from a wide field of candidates. ,\u201cPangalawa, hindi ko ho ugaling, kababaeng tao pa naman, kumare ko pang buo iyan,,\u201d Binay said. (Second, it is not my character to attack a woman, especially one who is my family friend.) ,The Binay camp has been sending mixed messages about Poe, highlighting a key problem in a campaign with multiple spokespersons, and with a candidate who easily gets peeved: messaging. (READ: ,Binay to launch party, ads despite freeze order,),Binay initially told reporters that he was considering Poe as his running mate. Yet when Poe publicly ,rejected the possibility,, the Vice President clarified that ,no formal offer, was made. He now says it is up to a search committee to find a vice presidential bet for him.  ,Binay reiterated this on Wednesday: \u201cThe word here is 'considering.' I did not approach her and say, ',Mare,, can you be my vice president?' There was no opportunity to do that. I will just repeat: there was no opportunity for me to offer her or approach her, and ask her to run with us as vice president.\u201d ,'I was with FPJ in final days' ,UNA's interim secretary-general JV Bautista last week also ,blasted Poe, for initially considering running with the ruling Liberal Party, whose members he said betrayed Poe's father in the 2004 campaign.,The elder Poe ran for president but lost in a fraud-tainted election against Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. During that time, the LP was allied with Arroyo and helped expedite the canvassing of votes despite objections made by Poe's lawyers.,While his spokespersons keep attacking Poe, Binay attempted to show his deep ties with her father. ,Binay again mentioned that he was FPJ's 2004 campaign manager, and was even with him at a Christmas party when the action star was rushed to the hospital in the days leading up to his death in December 2004. ,Binay said he even told FPJ, \u201cGoodbye, my friend. God bless.\u201d Still, it seemed like the actor was waiting for someone. ,\u201cEh kasi may superstition at nagkatotoo ah, pagka-landing na pagka-landing ng eroplano ni Grace, patay. Na-declare nang patay na si FPJ.\u201d ,(There is a superstition that came true. Right when Grace's plane landed, FPJ died. He was declared dead.) ,Now, Binay said it saddens him that ,Senator Poe signed the partial Senate blue ribbon subcommittee report, recommending plunder charges against him over the Makati parking building. ,Binay referred to FPJ's memory in questioning Senator Poe's statements about his reputation for corruption.  ,\u201cKung ako po ay dishonest and whatever, si FPJ po, hindi talaga nakikisalamuha sa may mga irregularity at dishonest.\u201d ,(If I were dishonest and whatever, FPJ would not deal with people who have irregularities, and are dishonest) \u2013, Rappler.com , ,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

Photo by Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 The opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), political party of Vice President Jejomar Binay, released a document on Tuesday, June 2, allegedly showing that Senator Grace Poe is not qualified to run for president or vice president in the 2016 elections. ,In a press conference at the House of Representatives, Navotas Representative Tobias Tiangco presented a copy of ,Poe's certificate of candidacy, for the previous mid-term elections. It showed that as of May 13, 2013, ,she had resided in the country for 6 years and 6 months.,This would mean that Poe would have lived in the Philippines for 9 years and 6 months by the May 2016 elections. Tiangco said this falls short of the required minimum of 10 years under the Constitution. ,Article VII, Section 2 of the Constitution states that an individual may run for president or vice president if he or she is: ,\"If honesty is so important to her, why is she not honest enough to tell us that she is not qualified to run for president or even vice president for 2016?\" Tiangco said. ,Tiangco, secretary general of UNA, was referring to Poe's tirades against the Vice President Jejomar Binay. ,Poe signed the Senate report, recommending plunder charges against Binay. ,The neophyte senator earlier took a swipe against the Vice President, saying that ,honesty should be the standard for higher posts, rather than length of service. ,Asked why Binay even considered Poe to be his, running mate, if UNA knew that she was not qualified, Tiangco said Binay was just being \"polite.\",\"She was never offered. VP Binay was asked if she was being considered so he answered,\" Tiangco said. (READ: ,Binay on his VP: 'Considering' not same as 'offering',),Binay was the campaign manager when Poe's father, actor Fernando Poe Jr, ran for president but lost in 2004.,A latest survey conducted by Laylo Research Strategies \u2013 commissioned by ,The Standard, \u2013 showed that Binay registered only ,a slim and ,precarious lead, over neophyte senator Grace Poe. ,The doctrine of ,animus revertendi,In a ,Facebook post,, Ateneo School of Government Dean Antonio La Vi\u00f1a underscored the flaws in Tiangco's revelations, quipping that \"somebody forgot his constitutional law.\" ,La Vi\u00f1a said the \"settled doctrine\" of ,animus revertendi ,applies in Poe's case. ,Animus revertendi, is a Latin phrase that means \"with the intention to return.\"  ,\"The intention to return to your place of origin is the basis of residence, and not actual, physical residence,\" La Vi\u00f1a told Rappler in a text message.,Critics earlier brought up the issue over ,Poe's citizenship,, which the senator dismissed. ,Poe said she used to hold dual citizenship but she was, born in the Philippines, and renounced her US citizenship before joining government. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

But this target is conditional on aid.    , ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 The Philippines has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations (UN), pledging to cut by 70% its carbon emissions by the year 2030.,But this emission reduction target is conditional on assistance from the international community.,The document, representing the country\u2019s contribution to the global effort to combat and prepare for climate change, was submitted on Thursday, October 1, Manila time, said Climate Change Commissioner and Secretary Lucille Sering. This was the last day the UN set for INDC submissions.,Aside from reducing carbon emissions, the Philippines says it will also commit to adaptation measures to help prepare its citizens for impacts of climate change such as typhoons and drought.,The Philippines' INDC submission:,But the INDC submission is only an ,\u201cinitial\u201d, one based on current available data from the sectors affected, reads the document. ,\u201cThis INDC will be updated as more data becomes available,\u201d it says.,According to the INDC, the Philippines \u201cintends to undertake GHG (CO2e) emissions reduction of about 70% relative to its BAU (Business As Usual) scenario of 2000-2030.\u201d,These carbon emission reductions will be taken from the energy, transport, waste, forestry, and industry sectors \u2013 the country\u2019s major sources of carbon emissions. Notably, the agricultural sector was not included even if it is the second biggest source of emissions after the energy sector.,But the 70% reduction target is dependent on aid from the international community. ,\u201cThe mitigation contribution is conditioned on the extent of financial resources, including technology development and transfer, and capacity building, that will be made available to the Philippines,\u201d says the INDC.,The Climate Reality Project calls the 70% reduction target a \"significant development\" for the Philippines.,\"Having less than 1% of the total global carbon emission, this is not only a gargantuan challenge for the government but for all sectors to cooperate and take action,\" said the group's country manager Rodne Galicha.,Preparing for Paris,Adaptation is the \"priority\" of the Philippines when it comes to its climate action pledge, said Sering.,\u201cOur INDC is based on our philosophy of undertaking mitigation as a function of adaptation, therefore, we will still prioritize adaptation measures,\u201d she said.,For adaptation, the Philippine government said it considers as priority measures the strengthening of systems for climate monitoring and observation, the conduct of climate and disaster risk and vulnerability assessments, improving the resilience of ecosystems, and the climate-proofing of sectors such as agriculture, water, and health. ,Like the mitigation contribution, the adaptation commitment is hinged on support from the international community.,The Philippines is among the country's most vulnerable to climate change impacts, makings its INDC \",greatly awaited\" by the international community, said the CCC.,The submitted INDC was the product of 16 consultations with various sectors: private sector representing affected businesses, government  agencies, academe, and civil society groups.,The last INDC consultation, held on September 24, was attended by 100 representatives, said the Climate Change Commission (CCC).,The final INDC differs from the ,draft, presented to stakeholders in that gathering. The draft then shown committed emission reductions by 10% from energy and transport sectors, unconditional on outside aid.,With aid, there would be another 10% reduction, read the draft.,The CCC, the agency that spearheaded the formulation of the INDC, was previously ,criticized for lacking transparency, in the INDC crafting process.,As of posting, 136 countries have submitted their INDC to the UN.

Former Makati officials allege that bids were rigged during the term of Vice President Jejomar Binay (left) and wife Elenita Binay. The Vice President's photo by Jose Del/Rappler, Dr Elenita Binay's photo from the Office of the Vice President,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 In his years serving Makati City\u2019s General Services Department (GSD), a former city official said none of the bids he handled were legitimate. ,Former GSD head and city councilor Ernesto Aspillaga  testified before the Senate Blue Ribbon sub-committee on Thursday, September 25, that every purchase request approved by then mayor, now Vice President Jejomar Binay was attached with a note indicating which supplier or company should win the bid.,Aspillaga said these notes were handwritten by Vice President Binay when he was Makati mayor, and also by his wife, Elenita, when she was mayor. He admitted, however, that he does not have any of the alleged hand-written notes. ,He described the biddings as, \u201cbidding-biddingan\u201d, or rigged.,The former city official, who rose from the ranks, said that was the way things worked in the city under the Binays, ,corroborating the earlier testimony of another former Makati employee, Mario Hechanova,, former vice-chairman of the city's bids and awards committee.,Like Hechanova, Aspillaga testified that during that time, he too received amounts ranging from P70,000 to P500,000, allegedly from Vice President Binay, to ensure the successful bid of the anointed company.,Aspillaga, an engineer, started working in Makati in 1972, under the city's Department of Engineering and Public Works. He was elected city councilor from 2004 to 2010. The subcommittee hearing is the 6th in a series probing the alleged overpriced Makati building.,The Vice President and his son, incumbent Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay Jr, are facing plunder raps over the building., ,'Ghost bidders',Although the building sparked the Senate probe, resource persons \u2013 former city officials, political foes, and former Binay allies \u2013 have detailed tales of the Binays' alleged corruption in the city.,Prior to Aspillaga, an official from a construction contractor denied participating in the bid for the controversial building, contrary to documents from the city itself which were read out during the hearing.,\u201c,Ang totoo po, hindi ko po nakita ang binasa mo ngayon. Hindi ko po alam kung bakit kami nandiyan. Malinaw sa, records ,namin na hindi kami nag,-,participate, sa ,bidding,,\u201d J-Bros Chief Operation Officer Alejandro Tengco testified before the Senate panel.,(The truth is, I\u2019ve never seen the document you\u2019re reading now. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re there. It\u2019s clear in our records that we didn't participate in the bidding.) ,Tengco also denied placing a bid on another Makati project, the Makati Science High School Building. In the first place, Tengco said, J-Bros was not qualified to do so under the Procurement Law. ,Another businessman, Marcial Lichauco Jr, testified before the Senate panel on September 11 that he  found himself, stuck inside a Makati City building elevator, on his way to bid for the city's rescue and emergency equipment \u2013 which Hechanova had cited in an earlier hearing as alleged proof of the bid rigging in the city under then mayor Binay.,Hechanova had earlier testified that the businessman was intentionally trapped in the elevator on orders of the Vice President, to let his chosen firm bag the contract.,At the Thursday hearing, Hechanova conceded that J-Bros\u2019 signature in the documents may have been forged. Hechanova, who vice-chaired the city\u2019s BAC after Aspillaga, said this was the way things worked in Makati.,In the case of the controversial building, eventual bid-winner Hilmarc\u2019s Construction Corporation listed down their bid \u201ccompetitors.\u201d Hechanova allegedly then took care of the other two companies\u2019 bid requirements. ,Senator Alan Peter Cayetano raised the alarm over the resource persons\u2019 allegations.,\u201c,Ang nakagugulat sa akin dito, hindi na naisali sila, [J-Bros] (What\u2019s surprising to me here is not that J-Bros was included) but that COA (Commission on Audit) did not check,\u201d he said.,Why now? ,The Vice President\u2019s spokesman for political affairs Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla criticized Aspillaga.,\u201cThere were hundreds of bids conducted during the period cited by Mr Aspillaga yet he admitted he doesn\u2019t have a copy of a single note. Obviously these are \u2018imaginary notes,\u2019\u201d said Remulla in a statement, referring to the Binays' handwritten notes alleged by the former Makati official.,Remulla alleged that Aspillaga was only after the immunity granted under the Witness Protection Program (WPP). \u201cWhy did he not reveal the existence of those 'notes' when he was being investigated by the Ombudsman for the same biddings he mentioned in his testimony, for which he is now facing several cases before the courts?\u201d Remulla asked.,Senator Antonio Trillanes IV moved that the subcommittee recommend that Aspillaga  be placed under the WPP, which the latter thanked the senator for.,Senator Aquilino Pimentel III, who chairs the subcommittee, said Aspillaga\u2019s admission to the WPP would be the Justice Department\u2019s discretion.

File photo by Fritzie Rodriguez/Rappler,\"It is child-nutrient deficient,\" she said. \"It needs to be fortified with more funds to combat malnutrition directly.\",Other programs of agencies should be \"put on a diet\" to prioritize more the welfare of those in need. ,Poe cited the National Bilibid Prison's daily allocation for its prisoners of P50 ($1.12)* and the Department of Education's school feeding program budget for each child of P16 ($.36)*.,\"Surely we can raise the meal budget for our kids to national penitentiary standards,\" she said.,Improving food production,Ending hunger does not end with providing meals to those in need. The country's food-producing capabilities should be maximized to ensure that self-reliance and food security can be maintained.,\"Turning the bureaucracy into one big commissary will not end hunger,\" the senator emphasized. What's needed is \"ramping up the nation\u2019s food production.\" ,The government's \"gimmicks\" portraying a land of bountiful food, she said, should end and focus should be given to the agricultural sector.,The ironic image of the country's top food producers being the poorest should likewise change, according to Poe, and it can be done by not just appropriating the right amount of budget but also ensuring that funds are effectively utilized.,\"We should ensure that most of the funds will go to farmers, in time, in full, for the right project, at the right place, and the right price,\" the author of various agriculture-related Senate Bills emphasized.,The call for accountability reflects the current plight of the coconut farmers from different regions in the Philippines. They are represented by the 71 coconut farmers currently traveling from Davao to Manila \u2013 by foot \u2013 to demand the immediate release of the controversial Coconut Farmers' Trust Fund. (READ: ,Farmers march from Davao to Manila for Coconut Fund,) ,To achieve this, a provision in the national budget that will pave the way for a system of checking the status of projects will be pushed by Poe. ,Waging war on hunger,The issues that plague the government now \u2013 corruption, peace in Mindanao, among others \u2013 should not be a reason to neglect the country's most vital resources: Filipino children. ,They, according to Poe, should be given the chance to have a better future not just for themselves but for the Philippines, too.,\",Kailangan nating bigyan ng sapat na pagkain ang mga bata para maharap nila ang hamon ng kinabukasan at maisakatuparan nila ang pangarap nating maging tunay na masagana at dakila ang ating bayan,,\" Poe said.

Back then, Smartmatic ,failed to transmit, around 23% of election results from VCMs.,Garcia explained that in 2013, \"there were many factors taken into consideration.\" One of these was that Smartmatic was \"not controlling the field.\",\"This time around, we are controlling the field. We are the ones providing technical support in the field. We are manning the National Support Center. And we are better prepared for the transmission platform,\" he said. ,With this, the Smartmatic official said, the transmission of votes could be 80% finished on election day itself, May 9. Then by noon of May 10, votes could be 100% transmitted.,He said 100% transmission on May 9 would be \"a dream come true\" if it happens. \"But because of the difficulties in geography in the Philippines and the availability of the signal in some of the areas, we may not be able to make it on May 9.\",Poor signal a problem, too,The activity on Saturday simulated the process on election day.,On Saturday, votes had to be transmitted to 3 servers: the Comelec Central Server, the Transparency Server, and the National Board of Canvassers (NBOC).,The Comelec Central Server and the Transparency Server receive the transmitted votes straight from VCMs.,The NBOC, which will declare the final results, gets the votes through a careful step-by-step process. ,In this process, the votes from polling precincts have to be transmitted to the municipal canvassing center then to the provincial canvassing center, before being beamed to the NBOC.,During the mock canvassing on Saturday, the transmission to the Comelec Central Server and the Transparency Server finished an hour earlier than the transmission to the NBOC.,Garcia said canvassing should have finished at 1 pm on Saturday if not for a few problems.,One of these was the swapping of ballots in Digos City in Davao del Sur and Pateros in Metro Manila. The correct ballots had to be shipped to both locations, prompting a late transmission of votes.,He said another problem was poor signal in a number of areas that he couldn\u2019t identify as of posting time. ,The chairperson of the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), Henrietta de Villa, said she hopes the Comelec will address a number of transmission problems seen in 2013.,One of these problems is permitting the manual or physical transfer of USBs containing election results to the \"next transmission level\", which means municipal or provincial canvassing centers.,\",Kung physical transfer, parang that defeats the automation purpose.

This role includes discussing the 2016 elections with party leaders \u201cbecause this is the presidency.\u201d,He pointed out that he never left PDP-Laban.

Even I, I cannot deny that we have common experiences, but we cannot ask him about these issues. I also want to know. That's why it is so hard to attend hearings when the accused himself does not show up because it's like you are talking behind that person's back,\u201d Poe said in Filipino.,The senator said that evidence and the public will ultimately judge Binay following a series of corruption scandals during his leadership of the country's financial district, Makati, in over two decades. ,Last week, the Court of Appeals (CA) issued a ,freeze order, on the bank accounts of Binay, his wife Elenita, son Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin \u201cJunjun\u201d Binay Jr, and alleged dummies over \u201clarge and frequent\u201d transactions done during the construction of the allegedly overpriced Makati parking building, and the Makati Science High School. ,Poe laughed when asked whether the AMLC also looked into her bank accounts. ,\u201c,Hindi pag-aaksayahan ng [AMLC] 'yung aking account dahil, unang-una, baka maawa pa sila sa akin,,\u201d she said in jest. ,\u201c,Mga P500,000 per transaction ay bihira tayong umabot doon.

Senator Grace Poe and Escudero were also partners in their 2013 campaign, and now in the Senate. ,\u201cHindi naman maipagkakaila na mahaba na ang pinagsamahan namin. 2004 pa lang magkasama na kami sa tatay ko. Marami na siyang napatunayan sa paninilbihan sa gobyerno \u2026 Pero hindi naman lamang iyon ang magiging basehan. Unang-una, pareho kaming walang partido,,\u201d Poe said. ,(We cannot deny that we went through a lot. Back in 2004, we were already together for my father. He has proven a lot in government service.

Bondal and Nicolas \"Ching\" Enciso VI accused Binay of violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act in relation to the Anti-Plunder Law.,They said the contract for the parking building \u2013 described in the complaint as \u201cthe most expensive parking builidng in the entire country, if not the entire world\u201d \u2013 was supposed to have amounted to only P245.56 million but was overpriced by more than P1.314 billion. The final contract price was pegged at P1.56 billion.,In their affidavit filed Tuesday, July 22, the complainants said Binay and his son, incumbent Mayor Erwin \"Junjun\" Binay, \"violated every rule in construction manuals and government procedures in pushing for a project that was grossly overpriced and funded by various loans\" which were irregularly passed through the City Council through supplemental budgets for 5 years. ,An 11-story building with a roof deck, one-level basement parking and 5 floors of parking area with a total area of 31,928 square meters, the parking building, in effect, cost P48,859/sqm. An additional P350 million and P46.62 million were also appropriated for the transfer of Urban Development Department of Makati City to the new building, the complainants said.,Based on figures from the National Statistics Office, the average construction cost should have been only P7,691/sqm.

At this price, the parking building should have cost only P304.18 million. Yet the total amount appropriated for the construction as of 2012 was P1.56 billion, or an overprice of P1.255 billion, the complainants said.,The overpricing is a result of a \u201cdeliberate, systematic and unconscionable raid of public funds designed by the Binays and the other respondents to defraud the people of Makati and gain personal profit in the process.\u201d,They also said the Binays should be held responsible for \u201cthis act of wanton misuse and plunder of public funds.\u201d,In their complaint, Bondal and Enciso sought the preventive suspension of the accused officials so as not to prejudice the investigation of the case and to allow unfettered access to documents and information.,'Serial losers',In his statement, Mayor Binay focused on discrediting the complainants and their motives, calling them \u201cperennial contenders and serial losers in Makati elections.\u201d,He linked the filing of the complaint to the release of a June 24 to July 2 Pulse Asia survey last week that showed that Vice President Binay remains the top choice for president in 2016.,\u201cThe filing comes just after the results of a Pulse Asia survey showed my father as the leading choice for President, with 41%.

(My question is: is that an issue?),Binay also dismissed Pimentel\u2019s statement that after he bolted PDP-Laban, the party will now leave the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), which Binay founded with former President Joseph Estrada of the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (PMP) for the 2013 polls.,\u201cThat will be their decision because we are not members of PDP. Because that is one of the things that triggered this. We, PDP-Laban, were part of setting up UNA so as a party, we were bound [to the alliance]. But then they did not follow it. So if the leadership of PDP decides to leave, that\u2019s their decision. Our [new] party will likely join the coalition,\u201d Binay said.,Binay\u2019s words harked back to his rift with Pimentel in 2013. Back then, Pimentel was a founding leader of UNA but decided to ,leave the alliance, after Binay and Estrada ,accepted his fierce political rival,, resigned Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri. Pimentel ran under the administration ticket Team PNoy.,The senator took exception to Zubiri\u2019s inclusion in the slate despite his strong objection while Binay argued that Pimentel did not honor the agreement to respect the nominees of PMP.,Pimentel filed an electoral sabotage case against Zubiri over the 2007 polls and accused him of depriving him of 4 out of 6 years of his Senate term. Zubiri belatedly resigned in 2011 amid mounting evidence of fraud.,Over the weekend, Binay also said that cracks in the party started even in the 2010 polls. Binay\u2019s spokesman, Joey Salgado, told Rappler that the vice president was referring to the decision of Pimentel\u2019s sister, Gwendolyn, to run for senator under the Nacionalista Party (NP) in 2010 instead of the Estrada-Binay ticket.,\u2018Binay: My party one of principles\u2019,Binay said he decided to form a new party to clarify the confusion surrounding his political affiliation.,\u201cBecause many people were asking me to join our party but it would be so unfair for me to say \u2018Yes, join us\u2019 and then leave the party they are joining,\u201d he said.,Asked what will make his yet-to-be-named party unique, Binay said, \u201cHopefully, the big difference people see is this is not a party of personalities. This will be a party of principles.\u201d,The Vice President said that aside from the incumbent UNA officials, a likely addition to his new party is the President\u2019s uncle, former Tarlac Rep Jose \u201cPeping\u201d Cojuangco Jr, who was also part of UNA and PDP-Laban.,\u201c[He] might [join] because there are also disgruntled Laban members. Historically, PDP and Laban were separate parties. PDP at that time was led by Senator Nene Pimentel while we were with Senator [Bobby] Ta\u00f1ada, and Ninoy Aquino in Laban. The two parties decided to merge. The way things are going now, those belonging to Laban are no longer happy,\u201d Binay said.,Besides partnering with PMP under UNA, Binay said it is possible his new party will also coalesce with more parties.,\u201cWe would not know. Maybe other parties want to join our coalition. After all, the coalition was accredited by Comelec in the 2013 elections. If the others want to join, then the coalition will decide,\u201d he said.,Binay said the new party is still in its early stages, lacking a mission-vision and other \u201cfinishing touches.\u201d He plans to launch the party on June 12, Independence Day.,HAPPIER TIMES. Joey de Venecia, Senator Koko Pimentel, Vice President Jejomar Binay and former Senator Nene Pimentel were together during the 30th anniversary celebration of PDP-Laban two years ago. File photo ,Nene Pimentel: No need for Binay to inform me,Pimentel said Binay\u2019s decision to leave PDP-Laban will not affect the party because the vice president was \u201cnot active\u201d lately.,The exchange of words is the latest sign of the deterioration of ties between the two political families. The Binays and Pimentels have been ,together in PDP-Laban for about 30 years,. (READ: ,Binay-Pimentel: The ties that bind,),Binay and former Senator Aquilino \u201cNene\u201d Pimentel Jr were the top leaders of PDP-Laban during the Marcos years until Pimentel retired in 2010 and passed on the party leadership to his son. In previous interviews, the younger Pimentel referred to Binay as his mentor.,Yet Zubiri\u2019s inclusion in UNA in 2013 changed the relationship.,Former Senator Pimentel took graciously Binay\u2019s decision leave the party they forged through the years. ,Asked if Binay talked to him about leaving, Nene Pimentel told Rappler, \u201cNo, he has not and he doesn\u2019t have to.

File photo by Ryan Lim Malaca ang Photo Bureau MANILA Philippines Due to its unresolved safety concerns and poor infrastructure the Ninoy Aquino International Airport NAIA has been tagged anew as one of the high risks airports in the Asia Pacific region a paper published by the International Air Transport Association IATA showed.In a recently released paper entitled Immediate and long term priorities for Manila Airports xa0IATA said member airlines have grave concerns about the safety of the ground movement operations and management of the airside infrastructure at the NAIA.Airlines routinely characterized NAIA as one of the top high risk airports in the Asia Pacific region from 2010 to 2013 due to air traffic management issues. These include extended holding vectors and delays non standard air traffic control procedures among others.Thus Blair Cowles xa0IATA regional director for safety and flight operations in the Asia Pacific issued on May 26 an operational notice to all airline members flying to the Philippines via NAIA. This operational notice alerts airlines to the ongoing risk to aircraft operations at Manila arising from unaddressed deficiencies in airside ground movement aids Cowles said. Hotspot areaCowles said the association had received an increasing number of airline safety reports since 2012. These cited deficiencies in airport signage markings lighting and charting particularly at the intersection of Runway 31 13 and Runway 06 24 known as hotspot area.Flight crews had described this hotspot area as poorly lit featuring markings and signage that are non standard and poorly maintained and confusing due to the complex configuration of taxiways IATA said.IATA added it had received 3 reports of runway incursion events in the hotspot area since November 2014.To reduce airside ground safety risks at the hotspot area IATA said ground movement aids should be installed and maintained while air traffic control procedures should be put in place.Aeronautical charts should be updated to accurately depict the existing airfield layout dimensions and markings it added.Reduce congestionIATA also reiterated that xa0more efficient air traffic control and improvements in the runway system are needed. These will optimize the current capacity and increase the throughput xa0to 51 or even 56 take offs and landings per hour from the current 40 movements. An increase of 40 in capacity will go a long way in reducing the congestion issues at the airport IATA said.The government should also reprioritize sufficient investment and resources in NAIA over the short to medium term to relieve congestion and help address current capacity constraints. Limited investment in NAIA will continue to result in the ongoing degradation of passenger experience. This will have a detrimental impact on the airport s ability to attract transfer traffic and the airport s reputation in the region it said.Also being pushed are the construction of all new terminal buildings with sufficient structural flexibility to safeguard for evolving trends in the industry additional building levels power requirements new aircraft types emerging technologies changing security and immigration requirements and the ability to improve levels of service.The government could also use the Clark International Airport in Pampanga as an interim solution to alleviate some of the current capacity issues of NAIA.But IATA said Clark International Airport should not be developed to become the long term primary gateway.

It is not a treaty but a formal agreement which is part of the peace process,\" said Duterte, who is also a lawyer.,Even if the policemen were carrying out an order from the court, he said the one who ordered the operation should have considered the \"existing realities\" on the ground.,Opposite opinion,While Duterte is pushing to halt the passage of the Bangsamoro law, Cebu Governor Hilario Davide III said in a separate interview that the Mamasapano incident should not stall the peace process in Mindanao.,A staunch ally of Aquino, the governor said the direction should still be toward a lasting peace and order in Mindanao.,\"The peace process should proceed, although most reactions are against it,\" said Governor Davide. \"I am against all-out war.

One other option presented was nuclear energy.,To reduce emissions in the transport sector, the CCC said the Philippines could improve public transportation by investing in Bus Rapid Transit and trains, and by modernizing jeepneys.,By improving public transport and promoting the use of cleaner fuel, the government can significantly lessen vehicle emissions which contain GHGs.,COAL WOES. Climate advocacy group Philippine Movement for Climate Justice wants the government to commit to less dependence on coal as part of its climate contribution.

It says that the country\u2019s priority adaptation measures include improving climate change forecasting and monitoring, use of vulnerability assessments as bases for its programs and plans, and the enhancement of climate and disaster-resiliency in agriculture, water and health.,The final version of the INDC will be submitted to President Benigno Aquino III for approval. Once greenlighted, it will be ,submitted to the United Nations, by October 1, said Sering.,October 1 is the UN\u2019s deadline for INDCs to be included in a compilation of INDCs that will serve as basis for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to be finalized at the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris, France. ,(READ: ,What's happening in Paris in December? 10 things to know,),This agreement will serve as the world\u2019s action plan to combat and prepare for climate change.,The INDC draft reads that it is only an \u201cinitial\u201d submission based on \u201ccurrent available data.\u201d It will be updated \u201cas more data becomes available and conditional to agreements by the Parties.\u201d,Backed by robust data?,But some civil society groups and officials questioned the presented INDC draft.,Christian Monsod, chair of the Philippine Council for Agriculture and Fisheries Committee on Climate Change, even walked out of the meeting after saying that the INDC appeared to be the work of only a small group of people.,\u201cThis is not nationally-determined,\u201d he had said. ,The Department of Agriculture repeated its stance on the INDC, saying the Philippines is not even obligated to submit an INDC, and that mitigation targets could stunt the growth of sectors like agriculture. ,But Tony La Vi\u00f1a, who served as spokesman for the Philippine delegation to climate negotiations, says the Philippines is duty-bound to submit an INDC.,\u201cOtherwise, we lose moral and political high ground to participate effectively in the negotiations. We should not go to Paris if we have no INDC by then,\u201d La Vi\u00f1a, dean of the Ateneo School of Government, told Rappler in a text message.,Sering\u2019s fellow commissioner, Heherson Alvarez, had asked if the data behind the mitigation target of the INDC was robust enough. ,The Philippine Movement for Climate Justice (PMCJ), a climate advocacy group, voiced the same concern. ,They wondered if the projected BAU scenario \u2013 or the GHG emissions if the Philippines were to do nothing until 2030 \u2013 included the 11,000 megawatts to be generated by the 29 coal-fired plants the Department of Energy (DOE) has approved. (READ: ,Legarda questions PH use of coal for energy,),The DOE had replied that only 4,000-megawatts from committed coal-fired plants (those with financial backers) had been considered in the computation.,\u201cBut if they included all 11,000 megawatts, the Business As Usual levels would be higher and so the emission reduction target should be bigger,\u201d said PMCJ national coordinator Gerry Arances. ,He said that with the speed by which coal-fired plants are transitioning from approval to construction stage, the BAU levels until 2030 should reflect all approved plants, not just the ones with financial backing.,Groups like PMCJ and Greenpeace want the Philippine INDC to contain clear commitments to cut down on coal as a source of power.,La Vi\u00f1a also has \u201cconcerns about the comprehensiveness and extent of consultations.\u201d ,Nevertheless, he said he supports the current draft \u201cwith some additional clarifying text that assures further consultations, adherence to environmental standards, and respect and promotion for human rights.\u201d ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/107093-philippines-indc-presented-stakeholders", "title": "PH climate commitment draft presented to stakeholders", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145863-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding-reception,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/105932-lack-transparency-philippine-indc,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/106043-philippines-indc-climate-pledge-united-nations-september"},

Vice President Jejomar Binay leaves his long-time political party PDP-Laban to form a new one for his 2016 presidential bid. File photo by Ayee Macaraig/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Vice President Jejomar Binay wants a cohesive party for his 2016 presidential bid, and that's why he's bolting his own Partido Demokratiko ng Pilipinas-Laban party (PDP-Laban).,In a television interview with TV5 Sunday, March 2, the 2016 presidential aspirant said he is forming a new political party and leaving the PDP-Laban due to factionalism.,\",Meron kasing problema sa party, especially sa leadership. Ayaw ko mang mag-break up 'yung partido, sabi ko kailangan tanggapin na ,natin 'yung nangyayari. Dahil sa maraming pagkakataon na kami, 'yung mga leaders in particular, hiwa-hiwalay pa sa pagsabak sa halalan,,\" Binay said. ,(There's a problem in the party, especially in the leadership. While I don't want the party to break up, I said we need to accept what is happening. Because in many instances, we and the leaders in particular were divided in strategizing for the elections.),The former Makati mayor and now vice president said his new party, which is yet to be named, is open to anyone willing to join, especially PDP-Laban members.,Among those he named were Cebu 3rd District Representative Gwen Garcia and Saranggani Representative Manny Pacquiao. ,On Saturday, Rappler reported that a staunch Binay critic, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, is also preparing to run for president in 2016. (READ: ,Cayetano eyes presidency in 2016,) ,At least two people close to him say Cayetano is looking to release ads as early as in the next few weeks to create buzz.,Interior Secretary Mar Roxas is believed to be LP's bet. He lost his 2010 vice-presidential bid to Binay.,Vilma for vice?, ,Asked about Batangas Governor Vilma Santos-Recto, Binay also admitted that he is considering her as a running mate in 2016.,But it's too early to tell, he added, noting that there are also others ,\"worth considering.\" ,\",Malayo pa ang 2016. Marami pang mangyayari. Bakit naman magsasabi ka na agad ng magiging VP mo? Lahat ay kino-consider pa ,natin. Kung bibiglain mo, 'yung mga nag-aasam asam, hindi na magkakagusto sa iyo,,\" he said. ,(2016 is still far from now. A lot of things can happen. Why would you say who you're VP is? We are considering everything. If you make a sudden announcement, those who are aspiring would no longer be interested in joining you.),Santos-Recto and her husband, Senator Ralph Recto, are currently with the LP, the country's ruling party.,The senator told Rappler Sunday they have no plans of leaving LP.,The Philippines however is notorious for its political turncoats, with politicians often shifting parties over irreconcilable differences and as a matter of political strategy. ,Various interests,In the 2010 presidential race, there were PDP-Laban members who ran under the LP instead of the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) \u2013 the coalition that catapulted Binay to the second highest executive position.,\",Meron kasi PDP-Laban na sumama sa UNA. Meron naman kaming tumiwalag doon sa usapan, sumama sa ibang partido..., Hindi na desisyon ng partido ang nasusunod,,\" he explained. ,(There are PDP-Laban members who joined UNA. There are those who didn't follow the plan and joined another party... The decisions of the party are no longer being followed.),As a result, Binay said, there are PDP-Laban senators who are currently part of the Senate majority and there are those in the minority. ,This, ,he added,, excacerbates the lack of unity that seems to hound PDP-Laban.,PDP-Laban is Binay's long-time political party, dating back to when he was a rookie in Philippine politics.,The party boasts of a colorful history. F,ormer Senator Aquilino \u201cNene\u201d Pimentel Jr's PDP and the late Senator Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr's Laban merged to form PDP-Laban. The two were prominent opposition members under the Marcos regime. Binay himself was a human rights lawyer and activist under Marcos.,Right before the 2013 elections, the party was even eyeing ,to become the country's ruling party by 2016,.,It will celebrate its 32nd anniversary this 2014. - ,with a report from Buena Bernal/,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/51950-binay-new-political-partyhttp://www.rappler.com/nation/51950-binay-new-political-party", "title": "Binay forms new party, says PDP factionalized", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/nation/51787-cayetano-eyes-2016-presidency,http://www.rappler.com/political-parties/12315-pdp-laban-s-target-ruling-party-by-2016"},

The Philippines is home to many climate action advocacy groups, many of whom want to be more involved in formulating the country's climate pledges to the international community. Photo from #SulongPH  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Two weeks before the deadline of national commitments to a global climate deal, the Philippine commitment appears threatened by disagreements between government agencies.,On Monday, September 14, a House hearing discussing the country's climate pledges revealed concerns from some sectors over the lack of transparency in the way the pledges are being crafted by the Climate Change Commission (CCC).,Climate Change Commissioner and Secretary Lucille Sering defended herself against allegations by the Department of Agriculture's Alicia Ilaga that certain sectors weren't being consulted on the Philippine's climate action plan.,The hearing sought to find out the status of the ,country\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution ,(INDC), a document that should be submitted to the United Nations on October 1, only two weeks away.,The INDC is a list of initiatives each country promises to do to prepare for and mitigate climate change. Countries' INDCs will become a vital component of the global climate deal to be forged in a landmark Paris summit in December. (READ: ,What's happening in Paris in December? 10 things to know,),The CCC is the lead agency in crafting the INDC. Sering presented the \u201cinitial\u201d mitigation commitment of the country, or the commitment to lower the country\u2019s carbon emissions.,So far, the commitment only comprises carbon emission reduction targets for the energy and transport sector, the two biggest sources of emissions in the country.,Sering explained that the CCC conducted several consultations with key government agencies; businessmen in affected sectors like energy, waste management, and transportation; civil society groups; and the academe.,But apparently, some sectors were left out.,\u201c[The department] has invited the Commission 3 times to explain the INDC and our position in Paris but they were not entertained because the Commission was busy,\u201d said Ilaga, who heads climate change efforts in the DA and negotiates for the country in international climate conferences. ,A visibly distraught Sering replied: \u201cThe DA had been ignoring our invitation\u2026 I tried to sit down with them but they don\u2019t want to.\u201d,Agricultural sector compromised,The lack of consultation has led to an initial INDC that does not take into consideration the concerns of the agricultural sector, said Ilaga.,Thus, it came as no surprise that the DA's official stance, read by Ilaga, opposes the INDC. ,She explained that the proposed reductions of emissions from energy and transportation could compromise the growth of the country\u2019s agricultural sector.,CLIMATE HEARING. Lawmakers, government officials, and civil society groups discuss the country's INDC during a September 14 hearing. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler ,For instance, the target reductions could entail a limit on building farm-to-market roads or energy-reliant post-harvest facilities for farmers. ,\u201cAlthough the agricultural sector is exempted in the proposed mitigation INDC, the mitigation commitments in the energy and transport sectors will greatly affect the support services to agriculture. Post-production inputs for fisheries and agriculture heavily rely on these two sectors,\u201d said Ilaga.,Sering countered that the DA\u2019s assertion was baseless.,\u201cWe went through the numbers one by one. No cost [to agriculture]. And if they\u2019re saying it will increase the prices of agriculture, please tell us by numbers,\u201d she said.,Reading the official position of her department, Ilaga questioned the Commission\u2019s determination to include emission reduction targets when the Philippines is a developing country that may not be able to meet such targets given its growing economy.,\u201cThe scope of INDC is left open without stress on mitigation. It is up to developing countries according to their national circumstances and priorities to decide what is best for them,\u201d she said.,Leadership,AKP party list Representative Rodel Batocabe, chair of the Special Committee on Climate Change, sought to mediate between the two officials. But he advised Sering to listen to the aggrieved parties.  ,\u201cWhat is clear now is that there is conflict between agencies so as a good leader you must also build consensus, especially now that we are going to Paris to negotiate. We cannot negotiate that we have different opinions. So let us build consensus here. We should not divide; we should unite,\u201d he said.,Government agencies like the DA are not the only ones feeling left out in the INDC crafting process. ,\u201cThe deadline is two weeks from now and no one has seen the draft,\u201d Ben Muni, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace, said after the hearing.,And though the Commission held a consultation with civil society groups on July 24, those who attended said they did not feel they had been genuinely consulted. ,\u201cWe didn\u2019t see the draft. Our inputs weren\u2019t required. It was merely a presentation of how they are coming up with the INDC,\u201d said Gene Ferrer of Aksyon Klima in a previous interview.,It seems that, even within the Commission, there are differing views on how the INDC should be prepared.,\u201cThe very requisite of the INDC is that you should be transparent because there should be an exchange of view points. There should be a substantive debate,\u201d Climate Change Commissioner Heherson Alvarez said in a previous interview.,Innovative approaches,International think tank ,World Resources Institute, says INDC preparations by countries should be transparent in order to foster trust between governments and citizens, and among countries.,It cited some Latin American countries that took innovative approaches to transparently craft their INDCs. ,Mexico, for example, held an INDC workshop for civil society and launched a public online consultation the next month. Last March, it became the first developing country to submit ,its INDC,.,Chile ran a 4-month public consultation listing mitigation efforts and calling for public comment. Brazil released an online questionnaire after public meetings with civil society. ,Sering said the Philippines plans to submit its INDC by the end of September. She said it would likely be a two-pager document that will detail the country\u2019s mitigation and adaptation efforts. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/105932-lack-transparency-philippine-indc", "title": "Lack of transparency threatening PH climate commitment?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/business/168878-roberto-lim-dotr-undersecretary-aviation-resigns,http://www.rappler.com/trending/%20Hannah%20Witheridge,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/95924-intended-nationally-determined-contributions-ph,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/103160-paris-climate-conference-cop21-things-to-know"},

For its electricity generation, it has switched from fuel oil to natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel., ,Indonesia, ,\"For 2020 and beyond, Indonesia envisions archipelagic climate resilience as a result of comprehensive adaptation and mitigation programs and disaster risk reduction strategies,\" its INDC said.,By 2030, it aims to reduce its emissions by 29% \"unconditionally.\",The Indonesian government reiterated that in 2009, it \"voluntarily pledged\" to reduce emissions by 26% on its own effort and up to 41% with international support by the year 2020.,Indonesia also plans to have at least 23% of its energy use come from new and renewable energy by 2025, in hopes of putting the country on a de-carbonization track., ,Myanmar, ,Like other countries, Myanmar wants to provide more households with electricity.,\"With the largest expanse of tropical forest in mainland South East Asia, Myanmar is already a net GHG sink,\" its INDC said. ,However, it admitted that it will need the assistance of the international community to ,socio-economic development while also containing emissions; after all, Myanmar is considered as among the \"least developed countries.\" Its mitigation actions will be conditional on international support.,Once it receives adequate support, Myanmar said it looks forward to \"developing its contribution further to the global effort to mitigate climate change while increasing its capacity to adapt.\", ,Vietnam, ,Vietnam commits to unconditionally ,reducing its GHG emissions by 8% by the year 2030, but the rate could reach 25% with international support. ,Vietnam, according its government, has made significant efforts in forest protection, afforestation, and reforestation.

year later.,\"This is a catalytic COP, not a huge leap forward,\" said Alden Meyer, a veteran climate analyst with the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists.,For Laurence Tubiana, France's top climate negotiator for the Paris talks, \"what is mainly at stake is setting a date for finishing the rulebook,\" she told Agence France-Presse.,Sweeping in scope, the Paris Agreement left more than 100 thorny issues to be worked out in nitty-gritty negotiations, from accounting methods for tracking cuts in CO2 emissions, to transparency in financing, to how to assess compensation for \"loss and damages\" from climate impacts.,By informal consensus, 2018 is the target for working out those rules.,More broadly, 2018 is the next critical rendezvous in the ongoing talks.,National carbon-cutting pledges that go into effect in 2020 fall seriously short of what is needed to cap global warming under 2.0C (3.6F) compared to pre-industrial era levels, the target set in Paris.,Average global temperatures have risen so far by 1.0C (1.8F) \u2013 enough to lift sea levels, trigger deadly storm surges, and unleash life-disrupting havoc on weather patterns.,\"We have to plug that gap,\" said Tubiana. \"The big battle of the next two years is how to get countries to increase their ambition.\",\"The battle is not won,\" she added.,Hottest year on record,Recent news

in August 2018 \u2013 ,nations will take again take stock of the problem,, and their capacity to react.,By then, most big greenhouse gas emitters will have likely presented mid-century strategies for

Institute.,The good news is that renewable energy has surged faster and become cheaper than almost anyone imagined possible only a decade ago, accounting for 23% of energy production and attracting nearly $300 billion (260 billion euros) in investment in 2015. \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/151244-climate-pact-goes-live", "title": "Climate pact

Illustration by Mara Elize Mercado/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 More than half a million or 534,054 Filipino schoolchildren are severely wasted, according to 2012-2013 figures of the Department of Education (DepEd). Wasted means they are thin for their height.,The World Food Programme (WFP) defines \"wasting\" as a \u201crecent and severe process that leads to substantial weight loss, associated with starvation.\u201d It is a symptom of acute undernutrition that impairs the immune system \u2013 increasing the child\u2019s susceptibility to infectious diseases and death.,A decline in children\u2019s nutritional status signals an eventual decline in their academic performance.,This is dismaying since these students will someday grow up to become the backbone of Philippine society. They will be our nation\u2019s future decision-makers, leaders, and producers.,If their minds and bodies are feeble now, just imagine what the Philippines will be in the years to come. Asia\u2019s \u201crising tiger\u201d may become a limping cub.,Hungry preschoolers, teens,The ,latest findings ,by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (FNRI-DOST) from 2011 show that among children under 5 years old, protein-energy malnutrition was a problem: 20.2% were underweight (thin for their age), 33.6% were stunted (short for their age), and 7.3% were wasted (thin for their height). ,This age group is crucial since this is when children are most vulnerable to infections and diseases, while their nutritional needs are also increasing. Physical and mental damages at this point will be irreversible. ,This period is a \"window of opportunity for nutrition intervention,\" according to FNRI-DOST.,Meanwhile, among 5-10-year-olds, 32% were underweight, 33.6% were stunted, and 8.5% were wasted. Among 10-19-year-olds, 35.7% were stunted and 12.7% were wasted.,These figures barely changed since the 2008 survey. FNRI-DOST warned that undernutrition continues to be a public health problem among Filipino children.,The Philippines is the, 9,th, country ,in the world with the most number of stunted children, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef).,Stunting results from long-term nutritional deprivation. It is manifested not only in shortness-for-age, but also in delayed mental development, poor school performance, and reduced intellectual capacity.,Meanwhile, the most recent Global School-based Health Survey by the World Health Organization (WHO) from 2011 reported that 11.8% of surveyed Filipino students aged 13-15 years old were underweight.,Hunger disregards the age of its victims; both kindergartners and teenagers can fall prey.,Hungry body, hungry mind,A student\u2019s life can be exhilarating, but also exhausting \u2013 physically and mentally. What does undernutrition do to these young minds and bodies?,Hunger, a preventable yet persisting problem, hinders children from achieving their full potential.,Unicef says that \u201ceven short-term hunger can adversely affect a child\u2019s ability to learn.\u201d,Undernutrition makes a child more vulnerable to diseases, disabilities, and death. It also disrupts a child\u2019s mental and physical development \u2013 which may lead to poor productivity in adulthood.,Concentration, critical thinking, creativity, and even their social abilities may be negatively affected. Instead of focusing on class activities, they may also be too distracted by pangs of hunger.,Micronutrient deficiencies, impair physical and cognitive development, lower intellectual capacity, and lessen productivity. Vitamin A deficiency may cause blindness, while iodine or iron deficiencies reduce a child\u2019s IQ, cognitive and motor skills.,Unicef also warns that worm infestation causes anemia and poor growth development.,Some students who do not have enough money for food attend classes with an empty stomach or choose junk food as an alternative. Their parents are unable to feed them nutritious meals due to lack of resources or information regarding healthy and affordable meal preparations.,Poor school performance,The ,2012 results ,of the National Achievement Test (NAT) revealed that the Mean Percentage Score (MPS) of Grade 3 pupils in the country was 56.98%. This is lower than the 2011 results (59.58%) and the 2007 initial results (57.42%). English, Math, and Science scores dropped slightly. ,Among 6,th, graders, MPS was 66.79%. This is slightly lower than the 2011 NAT Results (68.14%), but higher than the 2006 initial results (59.94%). There was also an increase in the scores in all subjects from 2006 to 2012.,Among high school seniors, MPS was 48.90% which is classified as lower average; however, this is still slightly higher than the 2005 initial results (46.80%).,Poor nutrition, however, is not the sole reason behind these test scores. These numbers paint an even bigger picture of Philippine education, assessing not only the performance of students, but also of parents, educators, and the government.,Children\u2019s nutrition as an investment,Investment on children\u2019s nutrition begins at home.,Parents are expected to provide the basic needs of their children, including clean, sufficient, and nutritious food.,But this investment does not end at home; the government must also educate and support its people, especially the poor who are most vulnerable to hunger.,Unicef says that \u201cwell-nourished children perform better in school, grow into healthier adults and are able to give their own children a better start in life.\u201d,In the long run, investing in children's nutrition will benefit the country's economy and future generation. \u201cWhen populations are well nourished, higher individual productivity, lower health care costs and greater economic output will ensue,\u201d Unicef says.,Go, Grow, Glow,GO GROW GLOW. Children must eat these three basic food groups every day to ensure optimal growth and development.

At the same time, votes will be encoded in a laptop in the voting precinct. The laptop will be connected to a projector, to allow the public to double-check the votes.,The automation comes in during canvassing in towns and cities.,Lagman said cheating, anyway, \"happens in canvassing, not in precincts.\" ,'Full replacement of PCOS',In his two-hour meeting with Comelec commissioners Friday morning, Lagman suggested the \"full replacement of PCOS machines.\" He said he doesn't trust these machines, which the Philippine government bought from the Venezuelan firm Smartmatic in 2012.,Saying PCOS machines can be easily rigged, critics ,want to blacklist, Smartmatic from the Philippine elections in 2016.,When asked if his proposed TCRES can completely eliminate cheating, however, Lagman told reporters: \"The system cannot assure that, but the system will improve the accuracy of the manual system. What we're weighing here is transparency against speed. Using the PCOS, you can see the results immediately, because the counting is instantaneous, except that no one sees how the PCOS counted these. So do we want to sacrifice transparency for speed?\",He added that it's feasible to implement TCRES in 2016. The software for it, he explained, is almost ready. He said his group wants to try TCRES in the upcoming recall elections and even in school elections.,Lagman's audience on Friday included Comelec Acting Chairman Christian Lim, Commissioner Arthur Lim, and Commissioner Luie Tito Guia. ,\"They're receptive to it and we will continue the dialogue,\" said Lagman, one of the staunchest critics of then Comelec chair Sixto Brillantes Jr in the 2013 elections.,'Back to Jurassic Park',Lagman pointed out that in setting up Friday's meeting, it helped that Brillantes already retired in February. He said he requested the meeting \"after he left.\",Former Comelec Chairman Christian Monsod also attended the meeting. He said he is \"listening to the proposals\" and hasn't defined his stance. In any case, Monsod said the accuracy of the election count \"is non-negotiable.\",Guia, for his part, said the Comelec heard Lagman's proposal because \"we have to listen to every proposal, every alternative solution, in line with what we want to happen here.\" He described the elections as \"a shared responsibility of everyone.\",Lagman also presented TCRES in a congressional hearing on the automated elections last March 19.,Brillantes, an election lawyer for 25 years before he chaired the Comelec, criticized Lagman's proposal. He said the manual counting of votes will allow election lawyers, for one, to find more loopholes and delay the process. ,\",Babalik po talaga tayo sa Jurassic Park 'pag bumalik tayo sa manual ,(We'll really return to Jurassic Park if we revert to manual),\" the former Comelec chairman ,said in the congressional hearing,. \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/89513-comelec-lagman-laptop-count-tcres-pcos", "title": "Poll watchdog pushes for 'laptop count' to replace PCOS", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/fashion/133835-solenn-heussaff-wedding-dress,http://www.rappler.com/nation/138019-last-session-serge-osmena,http://www.rappler.com/nation/4017-lagman-removal-from-comelec-not-related-to-corona,http://www.rappler.com/nation/76741-smartmatic-poll-watchdogs-claims-rehash-old-issues"},

In this file photo Japan s Emperor Akihito 2nd L and Empress Michiko R look out at well wishers while Crown Prince Naruhito L and Crown Princess Masako 2nd R walk behind as they make a public appearance on the balcony of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on December 23 2016. Toshifumi Kitamura AFP TOKYO Japan UPDATED xa0The Japanese government on Friday May 19 approved a one off bill allowing aging Emperor Akihito to step down from the Chrysanthemum Throne in the first such abdication in two centuries.The bill will now be sent to parliament for debate and likely swift final approval Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s cabinet signed off on the legislation.Abdication must take place within 3 years of the current bill becoming law.Earlier this year reports suggested that 83 year old Akihito could step down at the end of December 2018 and be replaced by Crown Prince Naruhito on January 1 2019.Reports of his desire to retire surprised Japan when they emerged last July.In August he publicly cited age and declining health which was interpreted as his wish to hand the crown to his eldest son.But current Japanese law has no provision for abdication thus requiring politicians to craft legislation to make it possible.The status of the emperor is highly sensitive in Japan given its 20th century history of war waged in the name of Akihito s father Hirohito who died in 1989.While abdications are far from unknown in Japanese history the last one was in 1817.The leading opposition Democratic Party has argued the law should be permanently changed to ensure stable future successions but is reportedly on side with the current one off bill after talks with the ruling bloc.Some scholars and politicians have argued that changing the law to allow any emperor to abdicate would risk Japan s monarchs becoming subject to political manipulation.The issue has also highlighted concerns over a potential succession crisis in one of the world s oldest monarchies.A government panel in April issued a warning over the dwindling number of male heirs.Only men are allowed to become emperor under current law though Japan has had empresses in past centuries.Female members of the imperial family must give up their royal status when marrying a commoner underscored by news this week that one of Akihito s granddaughters plans to marry her college sweetheart.When Naruhito who has a daughter but no sons ascends the throne his younger brother Akishino will be next in line followed by Hisahito Akishino s 10 year old son.But after that there are no more eligible males meaning the centuries old succession would be broken if Hisahito fails to have a son in the future.Many Japanese believe the sustainability of the throne can be solved by allowing for female succession but traditionalists vehemently oppose the idea.
