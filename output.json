A young child waves the national flag as crowds gather in front of the Greek parliament in Athens. Photo by Louisa Gouliamaki AFP ATHENS Greece Greece s anti austerity leaders were back in Athens Friday vowing to keep their promise to renegotiate the country s huge loans despite having little to show after a European tour aimed at winning allies to their cause. We are a sovereign country we have democracy we have a contract with our people we will honour this agreement Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told his hard left Syriza party in their first meeting Thursday since the January 25 elections.In a remarkable show of support thousands of people then gathered outside parliament standing silently in Syntagma Square the scene of violent anti austerity protests in recent years. We have nothing to lose said Stavroula Drakopoulou a 55 year old teacher. An estimated 500 people also gathered in Greece s second city Thessaloniki.Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis visited Paris London Rome Frankfurt Brussels and Berlin in the past six days to try to win over EU leaders to their plan to ease the crushing burden of Greece s debts.The tour began well but ended with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble restating his country s opposition to debt relief and expressing deep scepticism over the Greek government s proposals to restructure its EU IMF loans. We even didn t agree to disagree a downbeat Varoufakis told reporters after talks with Schaeuble in Berlin Thursday.The Greek minister will hope for a more sympathetic ear when he hosts a meeting with US Treasury deputy assistant secretary Daleep Singh later Friday.US President Barack Obama gave Athens a boost last week when he warned against squeezing debt ravaged countries such as Greece whose economy has shrunk by one quarter since 2008.Meanwhile Tsipras must prepare for his first European summit in Brussels on February 12 which will be his first meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Finance ministers from all 19 eurozone countries will gather the day before to discuss the stand off over Greece.In a sign of the pressure Athens is under to reconcile its domestic promises with its obligations to foreign lenders the announcement of the government s legislative agenda was delayed from Saturday to Sunday evening.Blows from Berlin and FrankfurtSyriza is the first anti austerity party to take power in Europe and its opening move to halt key privatisation projects spooked the markets and raised anew fears of Greece being forced out of the eurozone.The government also said it would no longer cooperate with the hated troika of auditors from the European Union European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund who are charged with enforcing the terms of Greece s 240 billion euro 275 billion bailout.Tsipras and Varoufakis later softened their tone and their creative proposals for restructuring Greece s loans were well received by many economists.But Germany viewed by many Greeks as the main obstacle on any easing of austerity remains opposed.A debt write down was not up for discussion Schaeuble said adding that he was unable to hide my scepticism... that some of the measures do not go in the right direction .Varoufakis had earlier made a comparison between Greece and Germany in the 1930s when punitive measures imposed after World War I led to the rise of the Nazis. If you humiliate a proud nation for too long... without light at the end of the tunnel then the pressure will rise in this country at some point Varoufakis said.Athens also took a blow from the ECB which announced late Wednesday that it would no longer take up junk rated Greek government bonds from the country s struggling banks.Europe s stock markets and the euro fell on the news while Greek stocks plunged more than nine percent in early trading on Thursday before recovering to close 3.37 percent down.The Athex general index opened largely stable on Friday.While the move ratcheted up the pressure Athens insisted its banks were safe as long as they still had recourse to emergency liquidity from the Frankfurt based central bank.The ECB has given the green light to make up to 60 billion euros 68.5 billion in emergency liquidity available to Greek lenders.

The player takes control of Grayson a.k.a Sir Galahad as he does The Order's will and completes his missions with either stealth or brute force.,The game's visuals are impressive. At first glance, it is hard to tell whether you are looking at a high budget animated movie or a video game. The texture and lighting are amazing and effective that we often find ourselves immersed at the game's environment and atmosphere. The Order: 1886 redefines the concept of story delivery in video games.,The transition between cinematic storytelling and actual gameplay is seamless and players will find it natural to move Grayson into action while a story event is being played out. This really helps in immersing players into the story. The game runs at 30 frames per second, ideal for achieving a cinematic feel.,The game's third-person-shooter mechanics are standard and easy to get into. The Order: 1886 favors shoot and cover gameplay similar to The Last Of Us and Uncharted.,There are other mechanics thrown in such as bullet time and quick time events. While in cover, you can initiate an attack in slow motion for better control and accuracy. This slow motion attack or bullet time event is breath taking to look at as Grayson switches stance after stance as he guns down each enemy that he sets his sights on.,There are also cinematic quick time events that require the player to press a series of buttons in succession as they are displayed while an event is unfolding in order for Grayson to successfully perform his maneuvers. In some missions, Grayson is required to move stealthily and employ his knife and hand to hand combat expertise for stealth kills.,The game unfortunately does not have a cooperative or multiplayer feature. The lack of this feature is rare for modern shooting games.,It would have been fun to play against other players using the game's armory of steampunk style guns.,The Order: 1886 is set to come out on February 20, 2015., ,Bloodborne,Along with The Order: 1886, we also got to play Bloodborne.,Bloodborne is a third-person action RPG developed by the acclaimed Japanese game developer FROM Software (Armored Core Series, Demons' Souls, Dark Souls 1 and 2). The game was made exclusively for the PS4.,The game takes place on Yharnam, a ruined city cursed with a plague that turns its citizens into monsters. The player takes on the role of the Hunter, a lone adventurer who seeks the rumored medical remedy within the city.,The city of Yharnam is breathtaking. Its design is inspired by victorian architecture and the atmosphere is dark and gothic. The houses and streets lie in a state of ruined beauty, giving these places an eerie and abandoned look. Houses have broken floorboards, cobwebs, tattered piles of books and papers, frayed tapestries, and shattered mirrors. The rooms give off a feeling of history and loneliness, as if decades had passed without any living soul setting foot in their halls. The streets are littered with piles of bricks, broken barrels, abandoned coaches, and rotting corpses.,The environment somewhat evokes scenes from Lovecraftian lore, as if HP Lovecraft himself helped in the level design. The graphics are beautiful and effective in immersing the player in the atmosphere. It's definitely a huge step forward from FROM Software's previous game, Dark Souls II.,We encountered several enemies in the game such as infected city folk and rabid monster dogs. Enemy movement is convincing and unpredictable. Encounters tend to become dangerous when you fight mobs of enemies, often resulting in the death of the player character.,This intense difficulty appears to be the selling point of the game as it rewards players who learn from their mistakes and take the time to learn the game's combat system.,Throwing pebbles at enemies to lure them one by one was a strategy we came up with after suffering several defeats.,The Hunter can equip two weapons, one in each hand. In our case, the character we used had an axe for the right hand weapon and an old firearm on the left. The firearm resembled an old flintlock pistol, just like the ones you would see on pirate movies.,Combat is challenging since it requires you to read your opponent's moves and strike when they are vulnerable. There are no shields in this game so you will need to dodge and roll to evade enemy attacks. This kind of mechanic teaches the player to be careful and avoid being over zealous when attacking.,DEMO. Sony's Arata Naito (L) talks with Rappler's Michan Lorenzo (R) as she tries out the two new games. ,We asked Naito Arata, Sony Asia Region Marketing Manager, a few questions about Bloodborne during the demo:,Rappler:, Is this game related to the Dark Souls series?,Arata:, Well it's being created by the famed company, FROM Software, but we see this game as some sort of spiritual successor to PS3's Demons' Souls.,Rappler:, Is this going to have the same brand of difficulty as the other FROM software game like Demons' Souls and Dark Souls?,Arata:, It's difficult but we don't want to describe it as a difficult game. Again, it's a challenging game but by observing the environment and the enemies you can always find out how to survive. I'm not a super gamer and my reflexes is not super good but I can survive and beat the enemies because I can understand how enemies will move.,Overall, Bloodborne promises to be a rewarding game to beat. It is set to be initially released on March 24, 2015. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/83149-the-order-1886-bloodborne-ps4-impressions", "title": "First impressions: The Order: 1886 and Bloodborne", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating"},

Dovann Arrabis said his family inspired him to study hard and make the top 10 list of the civil engineering licensure exams. Photo by Dale Israel    ,CEBU CITY, Philippines \u2013 It was the crucial last semester of his 5-year civil engineering course when Super Typhoon Yolanda left his family homeless.,Dovann Arrabis was studying in Cebu City at the time 120 kilometers away from his hometown of Daanbantayan where his family was still living at the time. It was difficult for him to be far from his family, knowing that the eye of the typhoon was nearing his town.  ,But his hard work and perseverance prevailed in spite of the devastation Yolanda caused him and his family., ,Arrabis placed 10th among all board passers nationwide who took the May 2014 Civil Engineering Licensure Examination and was one of the two students from Cebu Technological University (CTU) who made it to the top 10.,Early afternoon on February 6, the new civil engineer was among those recognized at the capitol for being a successful scholar of the Cebu provincial government. For more than 10 years, the capitol has been providing financial assistance and scholarships for the province's top high school students who want to pursue higher education.,Arrabis, who was receiving a monthly allowance of only P2,000 ($45), recalled how difficult it was to study while his family was living in tents at home.   ,\u201cPagka ugma adtong Yolanda, niuli dayun ko sa amoa kay nabalaka kaayo ko sa akong pamilya, (A day after Yolanda struck, I went home worried to check on my family),\u201d said Arrabis, who \u2013 at the time \u2013 was working on finishing his college degree in the evening, while studying for his licensure exam in the morning.,Overcoming odds, ,The eye of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) was near Daanbantayan when it made landfall in northern Cebu in November 2013. The town lost communication and many of its roads became impassable. Hundreds of families lost their homes because of the record-breaking strong winds.,Arrabis said that because of the typhoon, he stopped going to school and stopped reviewing for about two months to help his family recover.,\u201c,Naguol kaayo ko ato niuli, after duha ka buwan naka-recover rapud ko,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I was shocked when I went home. After two months, I was able to recover.) He explained that the will to improve his family's living conditions inspired him to stay focused. ,When he returned to school, Arrabis did not waste time and hit the books immediately. \u201c,Mao to nga sige lang gyud ko ug tuon, tig kadlawn na ko makatulog, kung daot ko ron, mas daot pa ko sauna,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I would study until dawn and was even skinnier before.) ,\u201c,Syempre ang pamilya gyud akong inspirasyon ,(Of course, my family is my inspiration),\u201d said Arrabis, whose father is a carpenter and fisherman. His mother stays at home to look after his other siblings, the youngest of whom is 10 years old. ,Inspiration,Arrabis remembered the first time he got to the city as he entered the CTU-main campus. He saw tarpaulins of achievers and topnotchers being displayed at the gates and around the school.,\u201c,Nakapangutana ko ug kung ako naa diha pud unya, unsa kahay feeling,?\u201d (If my face appears on that tarpaulin, how would that feel like?) That was the question, he said, that guided him all throughout college.,After passing the licensure and making it to the Top 10, he said he was so happy and proud when he walked around the campus with everybody smiling and knowing him. More than that, he said his parents were proud of him.,Magna cum laude,Now working with the Department of Social Welfare and Development regional office for infrastructure projects, Arrabis is earning a basic pay of P29,000 ($654) a month since October, his first job offer. ,He now uses his earnings to continue to support his family. He also graduated magna cum laude at the CTU.,At the capitol, Arrabis got a medal, a plaque and cash incentives totaling about P50,000 ($1,127.89) in a ceremony attended by Governor Hilario Davide III and Vice Governor Agnes Magpale., ,Each college scholar of the capitol, chosen among the marginalized families in the towns, got cash incentives between P5,000-P50,000 ($112-$1,127.89) for finishing school. The amount received varies depending on the student's achievement and for passing licensure exams.,At the time, he must have felt truly proud. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/83189-cebuano-yolanda-survivor-engineers", "title": "Cebuano Yolanda survivor among top 10 civil engineers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/139042-robredo-federalism-questions,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation"},

But going further back Luneta, calls for the President\u2018s resignation were already regular column fodders. In fact, even before Aquino could clock in a hundred days in office, some quarters had already demanded his resignation.,But why such a national \"penchant\"?,Many argue that our president exercises more powers, or that he is more powerful, than US president Barack Obama, as the former virtually controls the entire bureaucracy and has a vast influence that extends to Congress and the Supreme Court.,In comparison, we know how Obama was power-checked, others say check-mated, by the Republican-dominated and largely uncooperative Lower House, when majority of its members refused to fund the federal budget which resulted in a government shutdown in late 2013. The US Lower House, in effect, not only held hostage federal funding but more glaringly handed Obama an in-your-face \u201cwe are as powerful as you are, dude\u201d statement.,To better appreciate the vast powers and influence of our president, we refer to the impeachment of former chief justice Renato Corona as its almost perfect manifestation. I say almost, because public outrage, the political interests of senator-judges (vis-\u00e0-vis the upcoming midterm elections at that time), and Corona\u2019s own undoing via his \"unguarded\" testimony, among others, were in play.,The not-so-secret presidential push and inspiration, aside from \"clear instructions\" to allies in both houses of Congress, added up to the pressure for expedited proceedings.,Yet the vast powers of the president are held together by a delicate mantle of public trust, the maintenance or erosion of which can be as fickle as the weather gets, if we go by the latest round of trust survey ratings.,Regardless of the changing public mood, however, one thing remains constant: that the power enjoyed by the incumbent is contingent on the trust the public continually bestows on the office and its occupant, but really more so on the latter. This is, at least, in theory. And this is where the problem lies.,RESIGN. Filipino students hold placards calling for the resignation of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III after he delivers his second televised address on February 6, 2015.  ,We reckon that the election of Benigno Aquino III in 2010, while phenomenal on so many levels, has not much to do with his vision for the Philippines or how his program of action could register growth beyond his term. Rather, it has more to do with sentiments of people betrayed and shortchanged by his predecessor \u2013 a people desperate in their search for a leader who personified the complete opposite of the one they were about to replace.,In sum, the people placed their trust on the one man they believe would, could, and should cure the inherited ills from the Arroyo administration. This is hardly surprising at all under our patronage-driven and personality-based politics. Thus began the reign of Aquino as superman and president.,We cannot avoid discussing presidential resignation by not examining the failures of our political institutions, as well as open the conversation on the numerous attempts by various sectors to strengthen them. The institutional failures provide perfect havens to patronage and corruption, and until we do something fundamentally difficult to destroy these lairs, we will spend the rest of our productive lives digging deeper holes than plugging the leak, so to speak.,But to say that we preserve the status quo in the absence of a leader who is of the same mold as President Aquino is utterly irresponsible, if not downright stupid, and tantamount to insulting the millions, okay the thousands, among us who are better qualified to run the affairs of State.,Our aversion and resistance to presidential resignation is not without basis. For one, our unsteady political institutions still remain prone to subjugation by power wielders who come and go every 6 years or so, and whose combined tenures, so far, have only served to undermine rather than strengthen these supposedly impersonal democratic and therefore accessible institutions.,Understandably, there are many among us whose aversion is influenced by the character of the beneficial successor. (Being an institutionalist, this is the least of my fears.) What feeds more aversion is the uncertainty of the readiness of our institutions \u2013 unsteady many of them are \u2013 to once again be subjected to another round of changes before they could find traction as they undergo rehabilitation after a long period of \"maltreatment\" by previous administrations.,To be fair to the second Aquino administration, efforts were undertaken to flesh out results of its strategy, ,Daang Matuwid,. It may be devoid of vision, but ,Daang Matuwid, rallies people around one common cause and that is reforming public institutions. Whether these efforts have degraded patronage and minimized corruption is a different story altogether.,When Pope Francis came to visit the Philippines, Facebook was flooded with posters bearing the \u201cPope Francis for President\u201d slogan, maybe simply for being such an inspiring and unifying figure to a divided people.,Well, I have a bad news for them: even if Pope Francis succeeded President Aquino by some anomaly, chances are he will also fail just the same under our system as it stands, right as you read this. There is only one way a perceived good leader can succeed in a bad system, situation, or institution: he must reform it first, if not transform it.,So while no one holds the exclusive franchise to good governance, is there someone who can or would guarantee its continuity? That was a trap question actually.,Let me rephrase that by asking rather objectively, impersonally: Can our institutions afford to absorb, adjust, and manage (with relative ease?) the constant shifting of directions and priorities from one administration to the next in such a short period without losing focus on the core deliverables?,I hope each of us can muster our own answers and find our priorities of engagement. I have found mine in the last five words in the preceding paragraph that I believe can last me well beyond 2016. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Tony D.

That is why I started up Zenith Soccer Tours, to give young kids an experience they will never forget.\u201d,Gier\u2019s program will be running football camps that will give participants a chance to stay at the world-class Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre where high caliber coaches from professional clubs in the UK will coach them.,Zenith Soccer will also take them to a tour of the different football stadiums in London to watch how top English clubs train and play., ,The culminating activity of the whole expedition will be a four-team mini tournament, one team of which will be from a professional football academy,According to the Azkals skipper, he believes the activities his program will provide will not just assist aspiring football players in improving their game but also help them become better individuals.,\u201cI want to give these youngsters some memories they will never forget.  I am a firm believer that experiences like our camp and exposure to different environments and cultures at a young age will help develop and shape these children to become more well-rounded individuals, helping to give them confidence to really express who they want to be.\u201d,The 34-year old Philippine international explained although he is still not keen on retiring, he established Zenith Soccer as a way of planning ahead for his life after football.,\u201cI am not ready to hang my boots up just yet but I am getting to the stage in my career where I need to think about life after playing.  I firmly believe in this program and it is not only a way of me staying connected with football but also a way for me to help develop the grassroots potential that our Filipino based kids have.  ,\u201cThey [kids] will ultimately be the generation on which the success of football in the Philippines depends, and if I can help in some way to make sure that football continues to grow then I will be happy.\u201d,Gier noted he is currently in contact with football academies in the Philippines with the hopes of having future partnerships with Filipino clubs to help boost the local grassroots program. ,To find out more about ,Zenith Soccer Tours, you may log onto their webite at ,www.zenith-soccertours.co.uk, or email Rob Gier at ,info@zenith-soccertours.co.uk,. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/football/83193-rob-gier-zenith-soccer-tours", "title": "Azkals' Gier launches football program in UK", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding"},

I still find it interesting that back then people said they were overwhelmed and moved to tears when he passed by. ,One believer said on social media that it felt like \",nilukuban ka ng Ispirtu Santo, (you were filled with the Holy Spirit),\" as the Argentine pontiff whizzed by in his jeepney-styled popemobile.,But when I think about the many devout Catholics of this country who cling to their faith to make things better, the thousands of typhoon victims surpassing their struggles because they believe in and draw strength from their religious beliefs, suddenly Pope Francis, his presence in Tacloban, and his many stops in Manila become more important for me. ,Apparently, regardless of my personal beliefs, his visit did matter to a lot of people. Their truth is theirs to believe in. ,The oddity of it all,It seemed odd to me when my superiors instructed us to treat our respective assignments for Pope Francis' state and pastoral visit like it was our own beat, i.e. the issues, sectors, and/or institutions we cover on a daily basis.,That meant churning out stories containing usable information to minimize foreseeable harm for the millions who would troop to the venues of his talks and sermons.,It also meant listening as much as I could to people who didn't think the way I did.,These are people whose lives circled around \u2013 and whose actions were driven by \u2013 their Catholic faith.  ,Assigned to cover ,the Pope's encounter with the youth at the University of Santo Tomas,, I talked to ,young Thomasians, about what they thought about ,this rockstar of a Pope,. ,Most of them, saw him as a symbol of hope, of love, of the brand of Catholicism their church should aspire to. ,Their truth is theirs to believe in. (READ: ,The irresponsibility of rabbits,),Global influencer,Influencers like Pope Francis generate a great deal of news. Whether they like it or not, their actions matter.,There is no doubt about Francis' tremendous reach. He has a following of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. His words are given much weight by many, and his appeal transcends religious boundaries. ,With millions heeding his call, each move he makes and word he utters could translate to the world becoming a better or alternatively a worse place. ,While I personally detest the kind of influence Pope Francis wields (seemingly coming from a system that homogenizes people's beliefs), I have no control over those who genuinely choose to believe him and the Catholic Church. ,Again, their truth is theirs to believe in. After all, such beliefs were honed mostly due to structures I and many others were born into.,This, of course, does not mean we let go of our responsibility to question. (READ: ,3 in 5 priests live in a material world,),It just means that we understand that global influence matters in a world where people's actions and daily choices are shaped by the men, women, and institutions that influence them.,Influencers are newsmakers whether they like it or not, and perhaps more importantly, whether I like it or not.,\"Be healthy,\" our editor told us when we were preparing for the papal visit. ,\"Welcome the Pope,\" she said. \"Your belief or non-belief should not get in the way of a good coverage.\" ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/buena-bernal/82375-pope-francis-coverage-non-catholic-reporter", "title": "Their truth is theirs to believe in", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/171463-nadine-lustre-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/video/reports/81246-pope-francis-to-youth-on-loving-and-receiving-love?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=referral&utm_medium=share_bar,http://www.rappler.com/specials/pope-francis-ph/81176-ust-youth-testimony-pope-francis"},

It's hard not to notice the 20-floor towers of SM Wind Residences in Tagaytay City. All photos by Pia Ranada/Rappler  ,TAGAYTAY CITY, Philippines \u2013 Back in the 1990s, Berniemack Arellano and his family would rent a bamboo and nipa cottage for around P100 ($2.3) for a view of Taal Volcano.,The Tagaytay City he remembers was like a ,probinsya, (province) \u2013 cool, relaxing, no traffic, and laid-back.,It was the perfect vacation spot for a grade one student like him from Imus, Cavite, just an hour's drive from Tagaytay. ,\"Another thing that I remember about Tagaytay was the ,bulalo, stores in Mendez Junction. I can still remember Tagaytay with its marigold blooms and wide spaces. We would head on to Palace in the Sky to get a 360-degree view of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, and, on a clear day, the glimmering skyline of Metro Manila,\" Arellano recalls.,- Professor Noel Sedigo, Cavite State University, ,Back then, the top tourist draws in the \"summer capital\" were the Picnic Grove and Taal Vista Lodge, where you could lay your ,banig, (bamboo mat) on the grass and enjoy the breeze.,But today, Arellano and his family no longer frequent Tagaytay.,He says the city \"lost its magic\" after being victimized by \"runaway tourism.\" What was once a haven for urbanites is fast resembling an urban jungle.,\"The most evident change was the rise of high-rise condominiums, buildings, and theme parks in Tagaytay. Although I am for development, this seems to be runaway tourism and lacking urban planning,\" Arellano told Rappler.,A visit to Tagaytay now yields not only a view of majestic Taal Volcano down in Batangas province but of several new high-rise buildings, including the 10 towers of SM Wind Residences, each 20 floors high; the 21-story condominium Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland; and the 9-story Robinson's Summit Ridge Hotel. There are other major commercial projects on the way. ,The Tagaytay City Planning and Development Office told Rappler there are at least two more: The District Tagaytay of AyalaLand Corporation that will open this year and Tagaytay Fora by Filinvest Corporation set to open by 2016. ,'GET AWAY.' The 21-storey Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland is being marketed as the 'perfect refuge' for urbanites ,Tagaytay Fora will be a \"mixed use\" project composed of a 10-story condotel; a commercial block with a Metro Gaisano Supermarket, department store, 4 digital cinemas, and around 300 dining and retail shops; and a forest-like garden that can be used for events. ,The District Tagaytay meanwhile will feature two 14-floor condominium buildings.,Six new condominium buildings were approved last year and will begin construction this year.,It seems development is finally coming to the ,probinsya, of Arellano's memory. But a look at scientific studies commissioned by the Cavite provincial government and a talk with scientists show that Tagaytay's vertical and urban development may spell crisis for the rest of the province.,Know your neighbors,Water is often an overlooked resource, especially for a city rising so near a lake. But water is one of Tagaytay's looming problems.,\"Tagaytay may have water today, but it will be an issue in the long run,\" Professor Noel Sedigo, chairman of Cavite State University's environment studies department, told Rappler. ,Sedigo has been tapped by the province to analyze its water situation. After looking at various studies and making some of his own, he said the picture does not look good.,MORE CONCRETE. Summer homes and concrete getaways continue to be built all over Tagaytay City  ,While Tagaytay has just enough water for its households at the moment, its current trend of vertical development and urbanization is likely to cause a water shortage in the near future.,Water is a problem for the rest of Cavite too. In fact, a 2012 study commissioned by the province shows that the province as a whole is already experiencing water shortage.,The study, conducted by energy and bulk water supply group SUWECO, concluded that the province is already short of water by around ,1,200, million liters/day (MLD). ,This is because total water demand for 2015 was pegged at 1,777 MLD while the total amount of water the province can recover from under the ground and from its springs and rivers is only 618 MLD, according to a summary of the report obtained by Rappler.,How will the province manage in 2040 when it is expected to have a water demand of 2,845 MLD?,If nothing is done, Cavite's supply of groundwater (water stored underground for thousands of years) will run out by 2019, said Sedigo.,The SUWECO study showed that the agriculture-intense towns of General Trias, Tanza, Naic, and Imus drink up most of the water for irrigating crops. This is apart from the industrial, recreational, commercial, and residential usage of water.,Thirsty Tagaytay,The shortage is already being felt. According to a 1991 study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), intense groundwater extraction (the process of pumping groundwater to water pipes) is causing groundwater levels to decrease by one meter annually. ,The province estimates that its groundwater is now 15 to 50 meters below its level in 1990. Thus, to reach the groundwater and be able to deliver it to faucets all over the province, longer and longer pipes have had to be used.,In places as elevated as Tagaytay, 3 pipes, each 25 feet long, are now used instead of just one, adding to the cost of water. Data from the province and Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) showed that water rates have been rising steadily, from P125 ($2.8) in 2000 to P233 ($5.3) in 2012. ,And what about its new high-rise buildings? Sedigo said lower groundwater means contractors will need more powerful water pumps to bring the water all the way to the highest floors. ,NEW TAGAYTAY. The Sky Ranch has become a major tourist attraction ,The TCWD, a government-owned and controlled corporation in charge of water distribution, has felt the burn.,That's why it ,entered into a contract ,with a water company in 2012 to extract water from other parts of Cavite.,In the contract, TCWD admitted the city's \"dire need of additional water resources\" due to increasing urbanization.,\"Water demand is expected to increase tremendously, even as high as double the normal demand, and upon completion and full operation of all the ongoing establishment and hotels currently being built,\" it said in the contract.,But after a petition by Cavite residents who claim the water project will deprive ,them, of water, the Court of Appeals ,ordered the water project stopped, until issues were resolved. ,Cavite's 're-charge station',Tagaytay City plays an important role in this water crisis. Though it may not be the most heavily water-consumptive of Cavite provinces, its path of development determines whether or not Cavite can survive its water woes.,The city makes up the province's upland area, an area that, due to its geographic location and elevation, functions as a re-charge station for Cavite's water supply.,\"The monsoon winds bring rain clouds to Tagaytay. Because of the high elevation, the rainwater is able to flow down slowly, giving it time to infiltrate the ground and gather beneath as groundwater,\" said Sedigo.,Because groundwater comes in trickles, it took thousands of years for the aquifer below Cavite to form and become one of its major sources of water.,VITAL WATER. This is an image of how the hydrological cycle works. Image courtesy of Noel Sedigo  ,With Tagaytay now becoming more concretized, it may take even longer to replenish that aquifer, if at all. The city is developing fast at the cost of trees which help bring rainwater underground.,The more concretized Tagaytay becomes, the less water goes to Cavite's aquifer. ,\"If I had my way, I'd keep Tagaytay forested,\" said Sedigo.,Only around 7% of Cavite is forested. Almost half, 48%, is under concrete, while the rest is agricultural land.,But at the rate Tagaytay is going, Sedigo may be hoping in vain.,Since 2011, the city's number of commercial establishments has increased by an average of 33 establishments a year, said City Planning and Development Officer IV Carlos Zuniga.,Its number of residential units, mostly constructed in existing subdivisions, has been increasing by an average of 205 units a year. The past 4 years alone have seen the rise of 20 new condominiums of various heights (1 story to 11 stories), he added.,More worrisome is Tagaytay's expansion of areas for urbanization. ,In 2009, the city amended its Zoning Ordinance to classify 4 areas as new Primary Urban Core (PUC) zones. These areas are where buildings of up to 20 stories high can be built.,URBANIZATION. The red areas are the new primary urban core zones declared by Tagaytay in 2009. (Note: This map is an edited version of a 1998 map. The map was edited by Tagaytay to reflect the 2009 zoning ordinance.) ,City Ordinance 2009-054 identifies the construction of tall buildings as its strategy for prosperity: ,Today, 3 PUC zones are occupied by the new condominiums and commercial establishments, including the Sky Ranch, a recreational area with rides and restaurants. The 4th PUC zone is yet to be developed. Tagaytay visitors know it well: it's the Picnic Grove.,Define 'sustainable' ,City planning officials defend Tagaytay's path of development.,\"We don't see yet at present that the city's urban growth threatens our environment because we provide our own measures to protect the environment and we strictly enforce the zoning ordinance,\" said Zuniga.,The amended ordinance does control what type of structures can rise in specific parts of Tagaytay. For instance, only one to two-story buildings can be constructed on the Ridge, the highest part of Tagaytay facing the Taal Volcano. ,MEMORIES. A remnant of the old Tagaytay, the Picnic Grove is managed by the city government ,To ease traffic, buildings inside a PUC zone are required to provide their own parking space and set back their building at least 5 meters from the road.,The current administration has also stopped the construction of additional subdivisions on the ridge area of the city, Planning Officer Lambert Manalo told Rappler.,To keep its water supply free from contamination, households are required to have multi-chamber septic tanks. Establishments like malls, stores, and restaurants must have their own sewerage treatment plant.,But only time will tell if these measures are enough to keep Tagaytay's development sustainable. ,Arellano and Sedigo have a different idea of sustainable. ,Arellano said, if he was in charge, he would \"promote proper zoning measures and limited urban vertical development, in order for Tagaytay to sustain its tourism and charm.\",Sedigo suggested a shift to ecotourism and \"backpacker\" tourism to keep most of the city forested. He regrets the trend of building residential units and summer houses that will lead to increased use of the limited water supply.,\"Tagaytay should be kept transient. Tourists come, take photos, and then go home.\" \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/82916-tagaytay-development-water-shortage", "title": "Tagaytay's tall buildings spell a water crisis", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61027-tagaytay-cavite-indang-water-supply,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61584-court-water-company-cavite"},
{"author": "Natashya Gutierrez", "date": "2016-02-13T09:58:29.000Z", "content": " WIDELY PRACTICED. Unicef says 200 million women and girls living today have undergone female genital mutilation. JAKARTA Indonesia When Mary was in elementary school a male classmate was circumcised. xa0 xa0He received gifts from friends as a form of congratulations prompting Mary to tell her mother when she got home I should get circumcised Mom. I can get a lot of money. Her mother s response was not what she expected. xa0 You re already circumcised her mother said. I didn t know that. When When you were a newborn. Mary recalls walking away from that conversation thinking everyone got the procedure done females at birth males perhaps when they were a little older.But it wasn t until later that Mary understood the meaning of the conversation she had with her mother.Mary is one of 200 million women worldwide who have undergone female genital mutilation FGM . The number according to a new report from UNICEF is 70 million higher than what was reported in 2014.While the top 10 countries with the highest prevalence of FGM from 2004 2015 is in Africa the data shows that the increase is partly due to population growth and new data collected in Indonesia.Indonesia with its population of 250 million people is one of 3 countries that account for half of all FGM victims in the world along with Egypt and Ethiopia.Cutting the clitorisIt was in junior high school when Mary first realized that female circumcision was not a regular practice.In conversation with her girl friends Mary learned that not everyone had undergone the procedure as a baby even if all of them were Muslim. xa0First she started to argue about how it was an obligation in their religion as she had always thought it was but becoming more curious decided to read more on the matter.She started reading books on sexual and reproductive health studying photos of vaginas. She learned about the clitoris and realized she didn t have one.Soon after she read a book about female circumcision in Arab culture including books by Moroccan feminist Fatima Mernissi which thoroughly addressed and denounced female circumcision. xa0 I read the book and learned that the practice was one of many ways to control women. One way was through circumcision she told Rappler. xa0According to UNICEF FGM includes all procedures that involve altering or injuring the female genitalia for non medical reasons. It is a practice recognized internationally as a violation of human rights of girls and women with February 6 being the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation.Even within Indonesia the practice differs in various regions. xa0Secretary General of the Women s Coalition Dian Kartika Sari said the culture of female circumcision in each region is different. xa0 xa0 There is not just one cut she told Rappler on Friday January 8.In the island of Madura for example the clitoris is cut. In other regions the feeling on the clitoris is killed by slicing off a small part but it is not completely cut off. He also said it is still practiced in some urban areas.In 2010 the Ministry of Health released a regulation that authorized certain medical professionals such as doctors midwives and nurses to perform circumcision on female patients. xa0The technical details of circumcision was even mentioned in the regulations Make a scratch on the skin that covers the front of the clitoris by using the tip of a disposable sterile needle measuring 20G 22G of the mucosa toward the skin without injuring the clitoris said article 4 paragraph 2. xa0The regulation was repealed by the Deputy Minister of Health Ali Ghufron Mukti soon after. xa0Because while FGM is widely practiced in Indonesia many others in the country do denounce FGM as a violation of rights. According to UNICEF FGM violates women s and girls right to health security and physical integrity their right to be free from torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment and their right to life when the procedure results in death. What orgasm For Mary one of the rights taken from her was her sexual rights at 33 Mary has never experienced an orgasm in her life.She was first sexually active in college and is now married. But without a clitoris Mary said she has never experienced an orgasm a feeling her friends describe as much like flying. I can never relate when they talk about it she said. It makes me sad. xa0Mary said the books she read said women find it difficult to enjoy sex without a clitoris admitting that she is unsure if her problem is psychological or physical. xa0Mary said the problem has caused stress for not just herself but for her husband who for 5 years tried various ways to help her orgasm but to no avail. She said she views sex now as just a waste of time describing her sex as mediocre. There are two main reasons parents have their daughters undergo FGM in Indonesia the first is religious as many Muslims here believe that female circumcision is an Islamic requirement or at the very least is highly recommended in Islam. This is despite the fact that no formal links between Islam and FGM exist and that no Islamic laws or Quranic verses speak of FGM let alone make it a requirement.Even Fatayat NU the women s division of Nahdlatul Ulama Indonesia s largest Islamic organization have xa0acknowledged xa0that FGM is not mentioned in the Quran and is simply a cultural product.The second reason FGM is popular in Indonesia is because it is believed to reduce women s sexual desire and libido. xa0This belief is widely held. All parents obviously want their children to live the best lives possible and for most Indonesian parents this includes no sex before marriage. In today s hypersexualized world Indonesian parents would do all they could to ensure their children are safe from the risks of seks bebas xa0or premarital sex. xa0Female genital cutting is believed by some to be one way of achieving this. Without it it is thought girls will become sexually aggressive and will actively pursue undesirable sexual relationships. Never again Previously furious at her parents who asked that doctors circumcise her and her sister upon birth Mary has since accepted her fate and the fact that the effects of FGM is something she will have to live with for the rest of her life.Mary said her parents were apologetic when she first confronted them about it saying she was born in an Islamic hospital where it was common practice. Her parents she told Rappler didn t know better.UNICEF data shows Mary s experience is not that unique. Data shows that parents are the ones who ask for circumcision for their children the most followed by religious leaders relatives and community leaders.Even today many in Indonesia think FGM is still a necessity. Sari said many community leaders still preach FGM which is one reason why the practice still exists in Indonesia. It is also still a widespread myth that FGM has health benefits.However there is no evidence that FGM affects cleanliness or vaginal health. xa0Claims that urine and genital secretions accumulate and fester in the vulva vagina or urethra have no medical backing. FGM does not reduce chances of urinary tract infections or infections of the reproductive system. Instead data shows FGM causes risks to health.Research reveals that FGM is carried out mostly on young girls between infancy and age 15.

They were substantial and constructive Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters of the talks adding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande left swiftly afterward. Work is under way to prepare the text of a possible joint document to implement the Minsk agreements said Peskov referring to a widely flouted truce from September.A French official also called the talks constructive and substantial and said work was being done to pull together a document aimed at implementing the September truce.The three leaders who did not address the media after the meeting are to discuss the effort with Ukrainian President Poroshenko by telephone on Sunday February 8.The European pair s talks with the Kremlin strongman were seen an attempt to prevent the 10 month conflict in east Ukraine from spilling out of control as Washington considers whether to supply weapons to Kiev.The visit was Merkel s first to Moscow since the start of the Ukraine crisis while Hollande had made a brief stopover in December.Ahead of the talks Merkel played down hopes of a rapid end to the fighting that has claimed more than 5 300 lives since April.Merkel and Hollande first flew to Kiev on Thursday February 5 for discussions when US Secretary of State John Kerry also visited the Ukrainian capital.Kerry is set to meet Russia s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov at a security conference in Munich this weekend with the high level diplomacy seeking to resolve the worst East West crisis since the end of the Cold War.

Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe. President Putin continues to call for new peace plans as his troops roll through the Ukrainian countryside and he absolutely ignores every agreement his country has signed in the past Biden said.The West and Kiev accuse the Kremlin of sending troops and sophisticated weapons across the border to bolster separatists in Ukraine. Moscow has insisted it is not a party to the conflict.Observers have warned that if the United States gets involved militarily the regional conflict could reach a dangerous new stage and become a proxy war between Russia and the West.Russia is already under heavy Western sanctions over its alleged actions in Ukraine and European Union officials said Thursday that the bloc would blacklist more Russian individuals.The sanctions already in place along with low oil prices have dealt a blow to Russia s economy but have failed to force Putin to change tack over Ukraine.Ahead of the talks Hollande said a ceasefire should be the first step on the path to a comprehensive settlement. Kerry voiced support for what he called a helpful Franco German plan.

Part 3 looks at Marwan's regional and global ties to terrorism.,The information comes from classified intelligence documents obtained over a decade of research from nearly half a dozen nations and verified by at least two independent sources. ,A US-educated engineer, Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: his brother was arrested in the United States in 2007 while another brother was arrested in Indonesia in 2001. ,Marwan is wanted in Malaysia for the killing of a Christian member of Parliament in 2000, the only successful al-Qaeda linked attack in Malaysia. Marwan was also a leader of Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM, which carried out those attacks. ,A senior leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, once al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia, Marwan fled to the Philippines in 2003, according to the US, to evade a regional crackdown and is one of the last surviving members of his group. One by one, his compatriots were tracked down and neutralized by authorities: Azahari Husin, the expert Malaysian bomb maker who allegedly trained Marwan; Dulmatin, who fled to the Philippines around the same time as Marwan, killed by Indonesian authorities when he returned home; and Umar Patek, who left the Philippines and was captured in Abbottabad, Pakistan (shortly before Osama bin Laden was killed in the same city) before being extradited to prison in Indonesia.,Marwan managed to evade ,the first-ever US smart bomb attack, in the Philippines against him in 2012 in Sulu. That operation did kill his long-time host, Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail Gumbahali, better known as Doc Abu.,He also evaded a second secret special operations attempt in July 2012, after he fled to ,the marshy swamplands in Butig, Lanao del Sur,, near the Moro Islamic Liberation Front\u2019s Camp Bushra.,Another operation had been planned as early as September 2014 \u2013 perhaps the reason why suspended Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Alan Purisima remained on top in the ,January 25 Mamasapano, attack that killed 44 elite cops. Planned under his watch, these operations are extremely sensitive. (Authorities claimed the January 25 operation killed Marwan but they are awaiting confirmation through DNA tests.),Weaknesses,Many are asking why the Armed Forces of the Philippines or AFP wasn\u2019t notified earlier. ,\u201cAnyone who actually has that question fundamentally doesn\u2019t understand the inability of the AFP and the PNP to protect sensitive information,\u201d a former US Special Forces officer told me a day after news of the 44 dead operatives came out.  \u201cIf they notify anybody, that operation is done. It\u2019ll leak out, and Marwan will be gone,\u201d said the American familiar with the territory.,Anyone familiar with special forces operations knows of the often dangerous rivalry between the Philippine military and the police \u2013 a rivalry that has killed those caught in the middle and foiled numerous operations. This is part of the reason these operations are kept on a tight need-to-know basis. ,Multiply that by the organizational rivalries of their US counterparts \u2013 the CIA working with Filipino special forces operatives and the FBI working with law enforcement. Then add conflicting vested interests of local and national Filipino politicians, and you begin to get a sense of the complex brew on the side of the authorities. ,Now add the societal landscape they need to navigate: an area where law and order is weak at best \u2013 full of clan rivalries, private armed groups and overlapping family ties in the middle of a splintering Muslim insurgency, with a significant group pushing for peace and a minority spoiling for war. ,Over the last 20 years, numerous Filipino and US officials have told me there is no choice but peace because the reality is that the Philippine military and police cannot win a war. ,Now you can begin to appreciate how difficult the situation is.,3 women and an in-law,Marwan\u2019s first weapon wasn\u2019t his ideology nor the bombs he made. It was his women: at least 3 Filipino wives who cemented him into the landscape.,Although he never admitted it when he was interrogated by authorities in December 2010, his police interrogators suspected Aljebir Adzhar, alias Embel, was one of Marwan\u2019s brothers-in-law.,Embel's father was a trusted aide of Abu Sayyaf leader Doc Abu: he and his men often stayed at Embel\u2019s family home in Parang, Sulu, where Embel said Doc Abu \u201chad mass support.\u201d Over time, Embel and his brother began helping Doc Abu, first by running errands as young boys then graduating to scouting government troop movements to alert the Abu Sayyaf. This is the extended social network that made it so dangerous for the police and military to enter communities unarmed.,Embel talked about how Doc Abu gave him P70,000 to buy a brand new black Honda motorcycle with yellow stripes. That was what he used to do the weekly shopping for Marwan, who gave him P1,500 a week to buy a sack of rice, coffee and bread at Love Life Bakery in Jolo. Embel said Marwan would give him extra money to buy chicken siopao, which Marwan loved.,Embel was also the conduit for Marwan\u2019s conjugal visits, which began with Embel picking up Marwan\u2019s wife from the Jolo market. Then 17 years old, Jaida is a Yakan from Basilan.  Embel said she normally wore slacks and a shirt with long, black sleeves and carried two suitcases. She also \u201ccovered her face.\u201d ,Embel would bring her to the house of the barangay captain, where he stayed behind. Then she would walk another 30 minutes alone to the house of Embel's family, where Marwan would meet her. She would normally stay with Marwan there for about a month unless a military operation happens, in which case she\u2019d go back to the barangay captain\u2019s house.,His family didn\u2019t just support the Abu Sayyaf. Embel\u2019s sister, Kasma, is married to a member of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 1996. Over the years, though, internal fighting has often spilled out into streets in Zamboanga, most recently in 2013. Embel said his sister and her family lived in the MNLF camp in Indanan, Sulu.,At least two of the men trained by Marwan during this time were from Cotabato and \u201chad a strong alliance with the MILF (the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 2014) in central Mindanao.\u201d,Collusion,Finally, there is collusion between those who hunt and the hunted.  ,In 2009, Embel said he became close to Italian Eugenio Vagni, one of 3 members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf under Albader Parad. Embel told authorities he and his brother helped feed Parad and his men, whom Embel claimed received a ransom of P60 million for the release of their hostages, although ICRC denied it paid ransom.,That ransom, according to Embel, was negotiated and given to the Abu Sayyaf by Parad's relative, then Vice Governor Lady Ann Sahidula, who later ran for \u2013 and won \u2013 a seat in Congress.,Here's where it turns into quicksand: Embel said the kidnapping was masterminded by a jail guard whose father is a regional police intelligence officer. Part of the ransom, Embel said, was given to members of the police.,Now you begin to see how the lines blur, and why there are often many shades of truth in this land.,In part 2, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the February 2012 US smart bomb attack through the eyes of another of Marwan\u2019s brother-in-law, Ren-Ren Dongon, whose family\u2019s interwoven marriages cemented alliances between the Abu Sayyaf, the Rajah Solaiman Movement and Jemaah Islamiyah. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Part 2: ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: Ren-Ren Dongon,Part 3:  ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: From family to global terrorism,Maria A.

If you can cut through Digong\u2019s populist bluster, you will find a number of, actually not policies, more like policy thrusts.    ,Leni Robredo is the perfect antithesis of Duterte\u2019s misogyny, his hatred of women. Where Duterte is a loud braggart, Leni is ,tranquilo, \u2013 a few words, a shy smile and she gets her point across. Her victory is as amazing as Duterte\u2019s. It\u2019s hard to imagine that they both come out of the same pit of resentment and anger where many of our people live their lives day in, day out.,This was more than an election that picked our leaders. It is a warning to all our leaders, winners and losers alike, that things cannot remain as they are. Mar Roxas is the best president we never had. He had the misfortune of being perceived as representing the way things are, more than ,daang matuwid,, the kind of society where the more the economy grows, the more frustrated the poor become.,To be fair, more has been done for the poor under the Aquino administration than at any time under any one regime, even the last 4 of them taken together. The problem is that PNoy\u2019s personality, Mar\u2019s for that matter \u2013 their way of doing things, made it difficult for them to ,reach, the poor even as they accumulated projects and programs for them. They resisted, would not even know the first thing about, ,populism,.,I do not know if Duterte is a conscious populist. His oversized personality, his self-absorption makes him a perfect populist. On one side of his macho personality, his preoccupation with women, on the other, not unrelated, with violence. It is the people\u2019s fear for their personal safety that Digong is responding to. A populist is not accountable. All he has to do is (re)present in his words and actions the people\u2019s fears, anger, and hopes. A President Rodrigo Duterte, however, is accountable.,Unsaon pod lamang,In Siquijor, we say ,unsaon pod lamang,, accept what we cannot reverse, make the best of it. If you can cut through Digong\u2019s populist bluster, you will find a number of, actually not policies, more like policy thrusts. These are not necessarily implementable, but could set things into motion. Take his constant refrain, drug lords and police who protect them, beware. It would be nice if drug lords actually got scared and stopped operating. More likely, small time dealers and their teenage runners will get targeted.,It\u2019s not as if police are new to extrajudicial killings. They cannot be blamed if they believe that the statements of Duterte have given them ,carte blanche, to kill as many drug lords as they can. Outside of police killings, vigilante groups, often out of uniform police, will have even less restrictions. The problem for Duterte is that he does not have the kind of control over the national situation as he had in Davao City.,There are more doable things in police reform. Because police were ill-equipped and poorly paid, the Philippine National Police (PNP) for many became a platform for sharing profits with criminals. But much has already been done in police reform. The PNP is a more professional agency. Its image has moved beyond the potbellied policeman. Digong can consolidate these gains by following through on raising police salaries, and identifying those 3 corrupt police generals he talked about.,INCOMING PRESIDENT. Rodrigo Duterte in 'Malaca\u00f1ang of the South', DPWH Depot Compound, Panacan, Davao City. File photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler ,If the Duterte administration achieves nothing else except conclude a political settlement with the National Democratic Front (NDF), it will have made a major contribution. Duterte\u2019s experience in crafting a \u201cworking arrangement\u201d with the Davao City NPA, and his appointment of NDF nominees to Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions, have created better political conditions for peace talks than in the preceding administrations. All indications are that Joma Sison is anxious to conclude talks that will enable him to return from exile.,Whether Sison can get the local NPA to agree is another matter. If Benny and Wilma Tiamzon, who are not as enthusiastic about peace talks as Sison, are released, will they go along at the pace that Sison wants? A ceasefire should be relatively easy, but what \u201ccantonment\u201d means, will local NPA agree to remain in identified camps, is going to be difficult. The situation in Caraga, where Duterte wants an end to illegal mining, provides an example of difficulties. Can Duterte and Sison persuade the military and the NPA who protect illegal mining to forego their millions in protection money?,I do not understand what considerations underlie Duterte and his people\u2019s seeming hesitation on finalizing political settlement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front by pushing for the passage of the BBL. Waiting for constitutional amendments shifting the government from unitary to federal will take many years, and will not address the historical injustices to the Moro people. It\u2019s also curious that neither Digong nor his people have said much about Mindanao development. Surely it\u2019s not enough to stick a dirty finger at Imperial Manila.,While waiting for constitutional reform, there are many things that the Duterte administration can do to transfer more power and resources to local governments. They can retain Bottom-up Budgeting (BuB) for a start. Cutting it as Cabinet designate Ben Diokno reportedly suggests would risk the opposition of mayors. Poverty can be added to the formula for Internal Revenue Allotments (IRA). The long delayed review of the Local Government Code can be organized even as the more radical federalism proposal is being discussed.,There are many reforms that Digong and his people have supported, from FOI to mining to K+12. His economic team \u2013 Sonny Dominguez, Ernie Pernia and Ben Diokno \u2013 is strong and will likely continue the economic reforms of the PNoy administration. What people worry about is the volatility of Duterte\u2019s rhetoric. It\u2019s not just his cussing, it\u2019s also how Duterte will navigate the demands of his allies on the Left and the Right. We can always hope for the best. In Siquijor, we go from ,unsaon pod lamang, to hope, ,bason pod lamang.,Leni can help. With characteristic generosity, she says Duterte can expect 100% support. It may be best that she will not be in the Cabinet where she will be expected to provide undifferentiated support. From outside the Cabinet, but with the authority of her mandate as number two, she can provide critical collaboration, or if necessary, an alternative. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Joel Rocamora is a political analyst and a seasoned civil society leader who has been working on issues of democracy, governance, and social movements for several decades.

So he really had no choice but to make a play, and he did.\",Smith finished with 21 points off the bench once more to go with 9 rebounds and two assists.,The import's last play does not, however, overshadow ,Pogoy's statement game in his first finals appearance. The rookie buried 5 3-pointers, including one that gave TNT a 10-point cushion halfway through the fourth. He was a huge problem for the Beermen, who came out flat to start the series and failed to find a rhythm amid the KaTropa's pesky defense.,Castro also had his own big moment, coming up with a clutch 3-pointer that put the KaTropa up 102-99 with 44.2 seconds left. Castro was a rebound shy of a triple-double with 14 points, 10 assists, and 9 rebounds., ,Troy Rosario was another finals first-timer who did not balk under the all-new atmosphere and pressure on his way to scoring 10 points and grabbing 6 rebounds, plus plenty of hustle plays.,TNT capitalized on the cold-shooting San Miguel, who shot 6-of-29 from deep, and let its defense dictate the game from the start. They forced the Beermen to 13 first half turnovers and picked up 19 big points off of that, while San Miguel had only 6 points off of TNT's 8 turnovers.,SMB's total turnovers rose to 23 and they gave up 27 points by the end of it.,Charles Rhodes had a highlight 21-point opening quarter but was scoreless for the next two quarters before finishing up with 31 on top of 13 rebounds, and 4 assists. He battled foul trouble and turned the ball over 6 times.,June Mar Fajardo put up 18 points and 13 rebounds, while Alex Cabagnot added 16 points. Chris Ross and Arwind Santos combined for 22 markers as the Beermen's shallow bench came back to haunt them in Game 1.,TNT's deep bench, which is the team's edge against the championship-tested San Miguel, outscored the Beermen's by 46-18. Although Smith accounted for 21 of those.,Game 2 of this series is on Friday, June 23. ,Scores,: ,TNT (104),: Pogoy 27, Smith 21, Castro 14, Garcia 13, Rosario 10, Tautuaa 7, Semerad 5, Williams 5, Rosales 2, Golla 0, Carey 0, Nuyles 0. ,San Miguel (102),: Rhodes 31, Fajardo 18, Cabagnot 16, Ross 11, Santos 11, Lassiter 8, De Ocampo 6, Espinas 1, Tubid 0. ,Quarter scores,: 24-31, 56-51, 75-73, 104-102.,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/173625-josh-smith-rr-pogoy-tnt-seizes-game-1-smb", "title": "Smith hits winner, rookie Pogoy shines as TNT seizes Game 1 vs SMB", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/174317-rumors-pacquiao-decline-greatly-exaggerated,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked"},

The Court of Appeals issues a Writ of Kalikasan against a water company accused of building a dam that will deliver water from 4 rivers to Tagaytay City alone to the prejudice of other Cavite local governments. Photo from Drumlanrig from Wikimedia Commons,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Court of Appeals, through a Writ of Kalikasan, has ordered water company PTK2 H2O to stop extracting water from 4 rivers in Cavite. It also instructs the company to stop its construction of a dam and water delivery pipes in Indang town. (READ: ,Tagaytay tourism taking water away from Cavite residents?,),The Writ, issued on June 23, was sent to respondents PTK2 H2O, National Water and Resources Board (NWRB), Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) and Department of Environment and Natural Resources Region (DENR) Region IV.,The Writ, obtained by Rappler, orders them to \"cease and desist, pending resolution of this petition, from extracting water from the Ikloy, Indang, Lambak and Saluysoy rivers, from excavating, cutting trees and/or undertaking related construction works, and from implementing and/or executing any and all acts in furtherance of the alleged contracts and activities.\",The respondents were also ordered  to respond to the Writ within a \"non-extendible\" period of 10 days after receiving the document.,A Writ of Kalikasan is a legal remedy designed to protect a Filipino citizen's right to environmental protection. It may be used by any individual or group as protection from environmental damage that threatens the life, health and property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.,The order, issued by Presiding Justice Andres Reyes and Justices Manuel Barrios and Pedro Corales, was in response to a petition for Writ of Kalikasan with Prayer for Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) by Save the Water in Indang (SWIM), a group of concerned Cavite residents and environmental advocates.,The judges found the petition, submitted on June 18, \"sufficient in form and substance.\",Threatened water supply,SWIM accused PTK2 H2O of beginning a construction project that could threaten the water supply of Cavite province.,Documents showed that the water company had signed a deal with the TCWD to provide 50,000 cubic meters of water a day from the rivers. To fulfill their end of the bargain, PTK2 H2O has begun constructing water extraction facilities like a mini dam and pumping stations.,But scientific papers cited by the petition showed how this amount of water would bleed the rivers dry in a few years time. This could lead to water shortage for the 12 cities and municipalities who depend on the rivers.,The NWRB and DENR Region IV are blamed for greenlighting the project despite such studies and despite the lack of a proper environmental impact assessment.,But NWRB Executive Director Sevillo David Jr told Rappler that an Environmental Compliance Certificate is unnecessary for this type of project. He also gave assurances that the NWRB conducted their own study on Cavite's water supply and concluded that the PTK2 H2O project would not endanger it.,According to TCWD, they sought the services of PTK2 H2O because of the water crisis facing Tagaytay City once the commercial establishments and hotels currently being built are completed in a few years.,Tagaytay City is one of the most popular tourism destinations in Luzon because of its cool climate, proximity to Metro Manila and view of the majestic Taal Volcano. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61584-court-water-company-cavite", "title": "Court to water company: Stop extracting from Cavite rivers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/business/168878-roberto-lim-dotr-undersecretary-aviation-resigns,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61027-tagaytay-cavite-indang-water-supply"},

But the people behind the movie, including director Sam Taylor-Johnson and writer EL James, have said that they've taken great care to preserve the book's appeal \u2013 and meet fans' expectations. , ,Here are what some of the critics are saying. In general, reviews praised the glossy look and performances from the leads, while commenting on how the movie holds back when it comes to the more explicit scenes.,Sheri Linden, ,The Hollywood Reporter, ,Writing for ,The Hollywood Reporter,, Sheri Linden said that the movie's strength over the book is how the movie isn't hampered by the book's long descriptions, though the review does say that the screenplay does retain many of the book's memorable lines. ,Linden also praises the performances from both leads, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson.,Screengrab from YouTube ,Commenting on the sexually charged scenes, she said: \", The penultimate scene, where Christian punishes Anastasia with a belt \u2014 and thrills to it, as Dornan communicates with exquisite subtlety \u2014 is by far the film\u2019s most extreme.\",Lisa Schwarzbaum, ,Entertainment Weekly,EW ,also praised the stars' performances, particularly Dakota as Ana Steele, while pointing out that the film employs a sort of \"look-but-don't-pant\" tone throughout the film. ,\"...,the movie version appears to be aimed at a younger consumer crowd than -the readers (albeit a crowd qualified for R-rated entertainment). In any event, the result is confounding, leaving both those coming to the ,Fifty Shades, phenomenon for the first time as well as those who have read the book to wonder, for different reasons, Where\u2019s the beef?\",Screengrab from YouTube ,Elizabeth Weitzman, ,New York Daily News,Dakota is getting much acclaim for her role \u2013 she's consistently praised over several critics' reviews. ,\"[Jaime] Dornan, unfortunately, never evolves into anything more than a pretty face. But Johnson is a true find: She's so committed, she makes Ana's every discovery \u2014 in or out of the bedroom \u2014 convincing...,She's smarter and sassier than her literary counterpart, while Christian, thank goodness, is less creepy-stalkerish.\" ,Screengrab from YouTube ,This review also points out one thing which many readers might be happy about: the film does away with Ana's references to her \"inner goddess,\" which delights whenever Christian does something she finds particularly arousing, or whenever her character wants to convey a sudden turn in emotion. ,Justin Chang, ,Variety,Almost across the board, most of the critics remarked that the film gets a chance to do away with some elements that didn't work as well in the book, including its dialogues.,Photo courtesy of Columbia Pictures/United International Pictures , ,\"If the problem with too many literary adaptations is a failure to capture the author\u2019s voice, then that shortcoming turns out to be the single greatest virtue of ,Fifty Shades of Grey...\",\"In that respect, there\u2019s something at once underwhelming and almost heartening about the sleek, professional softcore spectacle of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d which substitutes a genteel visual shorthand for James\u2019 hot-and-heavy descriptions, duly cushioned by the rhythmic thrusts and heaves of Danny Elfman\u2019s score,\" continues the review. , ,Finally, here's a bonus from one celebrity who's seen the film: ,Kim Kardashian-West,, reality TV star, ,Will you be watching?

This poses a new challenge to the peace process.    ,MANILA, Philippines - Classified documents and maps obtained by Rappler show the terrorist targets of ,the first smart bomb attack, in the Philippines early this year are still alive and have now found sanctuary in central Mindanao, in a territory controlled by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). ,This poses a new challenge to the peace process between the government and the MILF. Both sides resumed their talks Tuesday, July 17.,The two most senior Jemaah Islamiyah or JI leaders in the Philippines are Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, who carries a US$5-M reward on his head, and Singaporean Mohammad Abdullah Ali, known as Muawiyah, who has a $500,000 reward for his capture or kill. ,Civilian and military intelligence sources from the Phiippines, Malaysia and the United States confirmed to Rappler that the two escaped the joint Phiippine-US smart bomb operation on Feb 2, 2012, which killed their long-time host, Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail Gumbahali, better known as Doc Abu. ,They are now in Butig, Lanao del Sur, near the MILF's Camp Bushra, seen clearly in satellite maps obtained by Rappler and verified by Philippine and US intelligence sources. ,Despite this, the Philippine military continues to insist that the two were killed in the February attack.,When asked by Rappler about the alleged presence of the two JI leaders in MILF territory, Mohagher Iqbal, head of the MILF panel holding peace talks with the government, said: \"The MILF also received that report... but our AHJAG is validating this on the ground.\",TALKING PEACE. MILF chief peace negotiator Mohaguer Iqbal. File photo,From Sulu to Lanao,According to classified Philippine intelligence reports, Marwan and Muawiyah were sheltered in Sulu for nearly two weeks by an Abu Sayyaf member belonging to the group of Radullan Sahiron, the most senior leader of the Abu Sayyaf today. Sahiron allegedly blamed the two for the death of Doc Abu, Sahiron\u2019s close friend. Their two groups often worked together against the military and in kidnap-for-ransom cases. ,\u201cThese two men were not in the kill zone,\u201d said Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore. \u201cIn the battlefield, such confusions can always take place, but today, the Philippine military is much more capable than what it was.  It\u2019s only a question of time that Muawiyah and Marwan will be either captured or killed.\u201d,The documents say Marwan and Muawiyah fled Patikul, Sulu, as early as February 27 after Sahiron and his cousin, MNLF commander Tahil Sali, pushed them out of the area. They were allegedly picked up by another Abu Sayyaf leader, Isnilon Hapilon, and travelled by boat to an area in Butig, Lanao del Sur, near the MILF\u2019s Camp Bushra.,Intelligence sources in Singapore and the Philippines told Rappler Muawiyah has called family members in Singapore since then. ,Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: one brother was arrested in Indonesia for a failed bomb plot; the other brother was arrested in the United States. Marwan is also wanted in Malaysia for the killing of a Christian member of Parliament in 2000, the only successful al-Qaeda linked attack in Malaysia. Marwan is also a leader of Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM, which carried out those attacks.,Filipino intelligence sources also told Rappler that the two men are travelling with pregnant Filipino women, believed to be their wives.,MILF and peace talks,Their area of refuge now becomes tricky because the MILF is in the middle of peace talks with the Philippine government. Chief government negotiator Marvic Leonen says he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the two sides will reach an agreement this year. ,\u201cIn 2006, the MILF committed actually to assist government and interdict lawless elements, and this is via an Ad Hoc Action Group (AHJAG),\u201d said Leonen in a recent interview on #TalkThursday. \u201cThe government has turned over to the MILF a list of its high-value targets (HVTs), and we hope that the MILF soon enough will keep to their commitments in 2006.\u201d,Both Leonen and Iqbal pointed out that AHJAG has helped resolve incidents of kidnapping, without ransom paid, and is part of the reason open conflict has been minimized this year.,Chief government negotiator Marvic Leonen,The difficulty is that the MILF also gave JI sanctuary from the mid-90's until 2005, when the MILF Central Command threw them out, along with the Abu Sayyaf and the Rajah Solaiman Movement. That was when JI members fled to Sulu.,\u201cIt\u2019s a reality that many of those that are lawless do have relatives within communities where MILF may be influential or dominant, and therefore, it may be natural that in some instances, they would come home and seek succor under their protection,\u201d added Leonen.,Marwan and Muawiyah pose a new challenge to the peace process. \"They are the two most important foreign terrorists currently operating in Southeast Asia,\" said Gunaratna. \"They are the two most important foreign international terrorists operating in the Philippines.\" -, Rappler.com, , , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/8719-jemaah-islamiyah-leaders-in-central-mindanao-classified-documents-amp-maps", "title": "2 JI leaders now in MILF territory - reports", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159568-isis-direct-contact-isnilon-hapilon,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/ph-travel/131325-mt-hamiguitan-unesco-world-heritage-site-philippines-natural-science-museum,http://www.rappler.com/nation/2910-us-smart-bombs-used-in-sulu-attack"},

It is equipped with high resolution, day and night camera and thermal imager. ,In the early morning hours of February 2, a ,Scan Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), showed a joint team of US and Filipino soldiers a live feed of what was happening on the ground inside the camp of a senior Abu Sayyaf leader in Parang, Sulu. ,They watched the thermal image of their \"military asset\" - a double agent - and compared what he was texting them with the images they were watching. The asset texted the location and pattern of movements of the people around him \u2013 information the soldiers verified through the thermal images they saw. When he texted that he was leaving the camp, the soldiers watched his thermal image walk away.,Scan eagles, also known as drones, have been operating in the Philippines for many years now.,Although originally flown from US navy ships and operated by civilian contractors, there are smaller drones operated by US special forces. Don\u2019t mistake these for the Predator drones and Global Hawks carrying hell fire missiles that killed Al-Qaeda and other terrorist targets in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ,In the Philippines, drones are used only for surveillance. ,This was confirmed by ,Philippine President Benigno Aquino III on Tuesday, largely because a drone strike handled by the Americans may violate the Philippine Constitution. US troops, Mr Aquino said, \u201care here as advisers. They are here as trainers. They cannot participate in combat operations.\u201d,Which is exactly what they have been doing. ,The US military arrived in the Philippines in February 2002, dubbed the second front in its \u201cwar against terrorism.\u201d At its peak, US troops reached 1,200, including 660 US special forces.,The military alliance also includes technology transfer.  ,In mid-2010, Washington pledged ,$18.4 million of precision-guided missiles, funded under a US Congressional Act, which allowed its defense department to train and equip foreign military allies.,A classified document from the Philippines is explicit: \"Fiscal year 2010 assistance for the Philippines provides a precision-guided missile capability to assist Philippine Armed Forces' counter-terrorism efforts in southern regions to combat the activities of the Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf Group.\",November arrival,The first smart bombs, PGMs or Precision-Guided Munitions kits, arrived in the Philippines on November 1, 2010. ,According to a technical timeline obtained by Rappler, Philippine Air Force pilots sat down with subject matter experts to lay out a training plan in December. ,Weapons training began the following year, on Jan 24, 2011.,Two months later, aircraft installation & training started, leading to test drops which were scheduled to begin in May of the same year. ,On June 20, 2011, the US delivered at least 22 more PGM kits to the Philippine military. ,During this period, US defense contractor Raytheon, the company which makes the PGMs, visited the Philippines 3 times, according to the documents.,Finally, on Feb 2, 2012, after nearly 8 months of training, the Philippines deployed its first smart bombs. ,Target: JI in Sulu,The targets had long been under surveillance: the 2 most senior Jemaah Islamiyah or JI leaders in the Philippines sheltered by Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail, better known as Doc Abu. ,They are Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, who carried a $5-M reward on his head from the US government, and Singaporean Mohammed Abdullah Ali, known as Muawiyah, who had a $500,000 reward for his capture or death.,\u201cThere was a target that was of high enough value with actionable intelligence and the right conditions that would warrant its use,\u201d said a military source privy to the operations. \u201cThese are expensive devices so they are used for the right targets at the right time.\u201d,There was a long, involved process to get to this point, governed by protocols set by both nations, according to documents obtained by Rappler.,The Philippines and the US followed 2 levels of clearance and parallel approval processes.,First, ground commanders from both nations identify a target. For the Americans, its Joint-Special Operations Task Force-Philippines (JSOTF-P) then coordinates with the US Embassy before getting approval from SOCPAC, the Special Operations Command, Pacific in Hawaii.  ,After SOCPAC approves, it alerts the US Pacific Command (PACOM). Then it goes back to JSOTF-P which then notifies its Philippine counterpart of concurrence for the target.  ,On the Philippine side, the commander of the Joint Task Force Comet (Sulu's military unit) coordinates with the Western Mindanao Command (WESTMINCOM) and when US concurrence happens, WESTMINCOM approves the target and authorizes execution by Filipino troops.,BLAST SITE. Sitio Lanao Bato, Sulu. Picture taken at 12:12pm on February 2, 2012,Between 2 and 3 am on February 2, Philippine Air Force OV-10 Broncos dropped the 227 kg (500 lb) bombs in the strike zone in a remote village in Parang, Sulu, demolishing much of the area. ,In the dark,The first signal that new technology was used was the choice of when to drop the bombs.,In the past, planes could only drop their payload during daylight because pilots used visual cues.  ,Now the smart bombs can strike in the dark because they are guided by GPS or a homing device.,About 45 minutes after the bombing, the military asset texted his handlers that he would check \u201cthe targets.\u201d  ,Sources said they watched a thermal image move back to the area. His text said that Doc Abu had been \u201cobliterated.\u201d  Marwan was allegedly \u201ccut in half from the waist,\u201d while Muawiyah was barely breathing with blood gushing out of a deep neck wound.,Based on that, the Philippine military ,announced, the deaths of these key leaders.,Wrong info,But it now appears that the asset was wrong about Marwan and Muawiyah. ,Civilian and military intelligence reports from at least 3 countries show, both JI leaders are still alive,. ,Last week, Malaysia's chief counterterrorism official Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said Marwan was still alive. ,Philippine military spokesman Col Arnulfo Marcelo Burgos maintained his position the JI leaders are dead and said Malaysia should provide \"conclusive proof of life.\" ,On the use of smart bombs, there are conflicting responses from the Philippines. ,Col. Burgos, based in Manila, said the military, \"neither confirms nor denies the existence of such munitions citing operational security reasons. However, its pilots have been training vigorously to further improve their proficiency particularly in the precise delivery of munitions to its identified target.\",Col Jose Cenabre, the head of Sulu's Task Force Comet, categorically denied the use of smart bombs: \"I strongly deny that. That's just talk. We did not use them.\",However, Lt Col Miguel Ernesto Okol, spokesman of the Philippine Air Force, told Rappler: \u201cOur pilots\u2019 accuracy in the past was not good. They were not adept, but now with considerable time training and through the advice of our allies, particularly the US military, we are able to increase the accuracy of our pilots to 80 to 90%.\u201d - ,with reports from David Santos/Rappler.com, ,Maria Ressa, ,is the author of ,Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of Al-Qaeda's Newest Center of Operations in Southeast Asia ,(Free Press, 2003).

Improving agriculture in the Philippines can push for inclusive growth. File photo by Fritzie Rodriguez/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 One would expect a booming agricultural sector in a country rich with vast fertile lands, but this seems to be not the case in the Philippines.,According former budget secretary Benjamin Diokno, the government should focus on the agricultural sector which employs a third of the labor force. (READ: ,PH agriculture: Why is it important?,),\"It is cheaper to create jobs in agriculture than in other sectors,\" he told Rappler.,In addition, pushing for the sector's development will lead to ,inclusive growth,, especially as agricultural workers are the poorest in the labor sector. (READ: ,The state of agriculture, fisheries under Aquino,),\"Agricultural growth in the last 5 years was anemic,\" Diokno stressed. \"If you pay attention to agriculture in the rural area, that's growth inclusive.\",Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority show that there is no significant change in poverty incidence among farmers.,What can be done,In a forum organized by Greenpeace Philippines, Nheden Sarne of the Agricultural Commodities Division of the National Economic and Development Authority said there are a lot more improvements needed before the country\u2019s agricultural sector achieves its full potential.,While the bulk of the programs of the Department of Agriculture (DA) are commodity-centric, Sarne suggested that it would be better if policies and projects will also focus on priority areas that can boost the stability of the sector.,1. Encourage investments in agriculture that promote area-based development,By ensuring that each area in the Philippines is prioritized through specific development programs, there will no longer be a problem of getting left behind. Each aspect will be tapped, leading to inclusive agricultural growth and eventually, economic growth.,2. Prioritize investments that can increase and sustain productivity,If the productivity of those working on the agricultural sector is developed, a lot of opportunities will open that can ensure growth. However, productivity enhancement should not only be on one or two aspects \u2013 it should cover the entire supply chain from production to marketing.,3. Ensure well-functioning irrigation systems and an efficient transport infrastructure,Irrigation systems have been a constant problem of the average Filipino farmer. If investments in a developed irrigation system is prioritized, it will make a huge difference.,Underscoring its important Sarne, noted that an improved irrigation system in any part of the Philippines can increase productivity by 15% to 20%.,4. Invest in programs that will increase resilience to climate risks and disasters, as well as pests and diseases,Farmers used to just face off with pests and diseases, and periodic typhoons, but as years passed by, climate change has contributed to the burden that hinders growth in the sector.(READ: ,How climate change harms the ASEAN food basket,),According to DA, farmers are the most affected by typhoons and other effects of climate change. Rehabilitation also takes time so developing resiliency is best.,Farmers should be taught on the various ways they can mitigate and  reduce climate risks. If possible, climate-resilient crops should be made available. (READ: ,Empowering farmers against climate change,),5. Promote greater private sector investments and support,Connection with the private sector can be made through agri-business schemes such as contract farming.,The ,Food and Agriculture Organization, (FAO) defines contract farming as \"agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between a buyer and farmers.\" Conditions then are set between the two parties regarding certain aspects such as quantity of crops to be produced.,The FAO added that both farmers and private institutions can benefit from contract farming.The farmers are guaranteed buyers of a specific quantity of their crops. Meanwhile, the private institution will then have adequate supply at agreed-upon price. ,Reforms needed,Beyond programs that aim to uplift the current situation, Sarne suggested revisiting certain agriculture-related policies revisited to test their effectiveness. If proven to be ineffective, these should be reconsidered or at least, revised.,One of these laws include Republic Act 8178, or the Agricultural Tariffication Act.,\u201c,Dapat may, close monitoring, na maayos pagdating sa, importation, ng ,agricultural products,\u201d Sarne stressed. \u201c,Hindi iyong, import, lang nang, import;, dapat maayos ang proseso rin.,\u201d,(There should be close monitoring when it comes to importation of agricultural products. there should be a proper process, not just always importing.),In addition to land and water reforms, Sarne also encouraged reforms at the National Food Authority.,He said the NFA should maximize the productivity of the local farmers by increasing domestic palay procurement. The NFA\u2019s role should also cover buffer stocking or ensuring a vast supply of rice.,Prioritize farmers,At the end of the day, the welfare of farmers should be kept in mind when implementing agriculture programs and projects. They are, after all, the country's main food producers.,\u201c,Ang mas importante siguro na sa hanay ng mga ,farmers, ay ma-diversify at increase ang kanilang sweldo,,\u201d Sarne said. \u201c,Sobrang maliit po ang sweldo para masustentuhan ang pangangailangan ng isang pamilya na pagsasaka lamang ang kabuhayan.,\u201d,(What\u2019s more important is that we increase and diversify the income of farmers. Their income is very small and definitely makes it hard for a farming family to make ends meet.),Being a country with rice as a staple, we cannot afford to lose our farmers. Their unproductivity can lead to a problem of food insecurity.,\u201c,May magugutom talaga kapag di masigla ang ,agriculture, mo, (There will really be hungry people if the agricultural sector is weak),\" Diokno stressed. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/102624-improvements-philippine-agriculture", "title": "How can the Philippines have a booming agricultural sector?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/97025-real-problem-political-families,http://www.rappler.com/brandrap/brighter-life/102988-realizations-financial-planning,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/59228-philippine-oceans-crisis-small-fisherfolk,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/52372-agriculture-hunger-food-security,http://www.rappler.com/business/economy-watch/66204-agriculture-inclusive-growth"},

Right now, martial law is implemented not in the fashion of 1972, but in accordance with the spirit of the 1987 Constitution,\" said Padilla.,The 1987 Constitution, crafted after the ouster of Marcos, ,specifies that a state of martial law cannot override the functions of the judicial and legislative branches of government.,The 1987 Constitution also does not \"authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function.\",A state of martial law does not automatically suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.,Its suspension shall only apply to \"persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with the invasion.\",During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, those arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within 3 days, or otherwise released., \u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/171522-martial-law-continue-after-marawi-siege", "title": "Martial law may continue after Marawi siege \u2013 AFP", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario"},

The Philippines can better address its food security and nutrition issues if the agriculture sector is further improved. Photo by Jay Directo/AFP,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Better nutrition begins with improving agriculture, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ,\u201cThe traditional role of agriculture in producing food and generating income is fundamental, but agriculture and the entire food system \u2013 from inputs and production, through processing, storage, transport and retailing, to consumption \u2013 can contribute much more to the eradication of malnutrition,\u201d the FAO said.,The Philippines is one of the world\u2019s \u201cmega biodiversity\u201d countries, rich in both fauna and flora.,\u201cWhile the country is abundant in natural resources, environmental assets remain unavailable to poor groups owing to exclusion, insecure land tenure, lack of access to technologies; or the resources are degraded,\u201d the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) emphasized.,Local groups like the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM), ,Unyon ng Manggagawa sa Agrikultura, (UMA), ,Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, (KMP), and, Alyansa ng Magbubukid sa Asyenda Luisita, (AMBALA) agree with the UNDP\u2019s observation.,The situation in ,Hacienda Luisita, is a prime example of such predicaments \u2013 farmworkers toiling away for several years only to receive little or nothing in return, according to farmers' organizations.,\u201cFor every one farmer in the developed world, there are 19 in the developing world. Where there is mechanization, fewer workers can produce more food,\u201d the FAO said. In response to this issue, the Department of Agriculture (DA) established the Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization.,In 2012, agriculture had a 32% share in the total employment, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). This is slightly lower than in previous years., ,However, the share of agriculture in the country's economy was only 11%, according to PSA.,In 2013, the government announced that it will focus on creating more jobs in the agriculture sector.,Distribution by sub-sector. Source: Philippine Statistics Authority, CountrySTAT,PH Crops. Source: Philippine Statistics Authority, CountrySTAT,The World Bank reported that the share of agriculture in the country's economy has been halved over the years, from 24.6% in 1985 to 12.8% in 2011.,PSA noted that in 2012, the country's earnings from agricultural exports were lower by 7.9% from the previous year, while import expenditures grew by 3.6%.,These figures may seem baffling since the Philippines is a predominantly agricultural country, yet improvement in the agriculture sector has been rather slow.,Agriculture and poverty,The FAO stressed the need for policies enhancing agricultural productivity and food availability.,\u201cAgricultural productivity growth contributes to better nutrition through raising incomes, especially in countries where the sector accounts for a large share of the economy and employment, and by reducing the cost of food for all consumers,\u201d the FAO explained.,A study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggested that agricultural growth contributes to a country's overall poverty reduction.,\u201cThe payoff from investments in agricultural research, development, extension and education comes in the form of sustained increase in agricultural productivity,\u201d the study said. This can increase the GDP/agricultural worker, positively contributing to poverty reduction. ,Fishermen and farmers have always had the highest poverty incidence among the country\u2019s basic sectors from 2003 to 2009, according to the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB).,Poverty incidence among fishermen grew in the past six years while poverty incidence among farmers remained virtually unchanged. Region IX had the highest poverty incidence among farmers at 54%. For fishermen, the highest was in CARAGA, at 59.2%.,It is quite ironic that those who are providing most of the nation's food are also among the most ,food insecure,.,\u201cAchieving food security means not just ensuring that sufficient food is produced, but also that everyone has access to it \u2013 and failures of access to food, particularly for the most marginal communities, are largely hidden from the public view,\u201d the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) stressed.,The UNESCAP advised countries to take care of its environment to achieve agricultural sustainability and food security. The FAO reported that around half of the Philippines\u2019 irrigated cropland \u201chas already been lost to urban development.\u201d,GDP growth not enough?,INCLUSIVE GROWTH? Can all sectors, including farmers and fishermen, feel the country's 7.2% GDP growth? Rappler file photo,\u201cPoverty encompasses different dimensions of deprivation that relate to human capabilities including consumption and food security, health, education, rights, voice, security, dignity and decent work,\u201d the OECD said.,Despite the country\u2019s recent strides in its economic performance \u2013 7.2% GDP growth in 2013 \u2013 more Filipinos were hungry by the end of 2013. According to the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) ,survey,, 41% of Filipino households (or 8.8 million households) claim to be food-poor.,What does this ,paradox, tell us?,According to the FAO, economic growth alone will not solve food insecurity, it must be paired with:,The FAO emphasized the importance of pro-poor policies. \u201cThe growth can raise incomes and reduce hunger, but higher economic growth may not reach everyone. It may not lead to more and better jobs for all, unless policies specifically target the poor, especially those in rural areas.\u201d,\u201cIn poor countries, hunger and poverty reduction will only be achieved with growth that is not only sustained, but also broadly shared,\u201d the FAO added.,The Philippines must also improve its calamity preparedness and recovery systems. The FAO, reported, that by the end of 2011, the Philippines lost over 600,000 tons of milled rice due to typhoons, while 6% of the country\u2019s rice farmlands were destroyed.,After Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), agricultural damages amounted to ,P31.13 billion, as of January 2014, according to DA.,Hungry tiger cub?,Rice is a staple food for most Southeast Asian countries, including the four \u201ctiger cub economies\u201d \u2013 the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.,Production of rice paddy in 2010.

Other developing nations in Southeast Asia are also trying to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of alleviating extreme hunger and poverty by 2015. , ,(Source: NSCB, FAO),The lower the level of food inadequacy, the better. Compared to other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines lies somewhere in the middle. ,From 2010-2012, the Philippines had the ,5th highest ,food inadequacy at 54%, behind Cambodia (27.1%), Myanmar (29.5%), Laos (38.3%), and Timor Leste (46.1%), according to the FAO.,Among Asia's so-called \"tiger cubs,\" the Philippines had the highest prevalence of food inadequacy. The others \u2013 Malaysia (6.9%), Thailand (15.5%), and Indonesia (15.8%) \u2013 are making leaps in reducing inadequate food access.,In 7 years, or from 2005-2012, the Philippines reduced its food inadequacy by only 1.7% compared to  Indonesia (8.8%) and Thailand (3.3%).,According to the 2013 World Food Insecurity ,Report ,of the FAO, 15.6 million Filipinos were undernourished from 2011 to 2013. This barely changed since 1990, when it was at 15.5 million.,These figures paint a picture of how serious the Philippines is in its fight against ,hunger and poverty,. ,Though we may be lagging behind in the past few years, it is never too late to pick up our pace; after all, the challenge to alleviate hunger goes beyond 2015. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/52372-agriculture-hunger-food-security", "title": "PH agriculture: Why is it important?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/business/economy-watch/84323-project-waves-toward-sustainable-development,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/117894-prediksi-seriea-liga-italia-2016,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/92207-sws-food-poverty-survey-first-quarter-2015"},

Ia menorehkan tulisannya pada secarik kertas tersebut. ,\u201cBeliau selalu mencatat semuanya,\u201d kata juru bicara wakil presiden, Husein \"Uceng\" Abdullah, pada Rappler, Selasa malam, 22 Desember. ,Malam itu berbagai pertanyaan dari Forum Pemimpin Redaksi ditujukan pada Kalla. Mulai dari kasus saham PT Freeport Indonesia hingga kesehatan pribadi. Seperti diketahui Kalla sempat dirawat di rumah sakit, September ini.,Rappler Indonesia, yang diwakili Uni Lubis dan Febriana Firdaus, juga mendapat kesempatan untuk bertanya.,Berikut adalah sebagian pertanyaan yang Rappler ajukan pada Kalla, yang diberi judul \u201cCatatan akhir tahun Wakil Presiden Jusuf Kalla\u201d. Selebihnya adalah pertanyaan peserta di forum.  ,Apakah target Anda selama jadi Wapres tahun ini tercapai? ,Tentu ukurannya macam-macam. Ukuran dari segi ekonomi pertumbuhan kita capai, pajak kita capai, tapi kita berusaha keras. Saya kira OK, banyak, keamanan stabil. ,Ada yang belum tercapai? ,Tergantung, cita-cita banyak. Tapi yang seperti saya bilang tadi (Mengulangi soal pencapaian di bidang ekonomi).,Apa yang paling mengganggu seorang Jusuf Kalla?,Hampir semuanya. Masalah bangsa keseluruhan, bagaimana sosialnya stabil, kita lebih baik, semuanya menyita perhatian. ,Soal Freeport, mungkin? Keponakan anda, Erwin Aksa, disebut-sebut pernah ketemu bos Freeport, Jim Bob? , ,Kemenakan saya yang bertemu, saya yang harus bertanggung jawab? ,Apa yang terjadi saat Sudirman melapor soal Freeport? ,Sudirman ,(Menteri Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral Sudirman Said) ,kan ada dulu di masyarakat transparansi bersama Erry Riyana, jadi dia semangatnya itu (Sambil mengepalkan tangannya di dada).,Saya bilang Maroef (Direktur Utama PT Freeport Indonesia Maroef Sjamsoedin) kok sendirian, padahal ada SOP (,Standar Operating Procedure,) di Freeport harus berdua. ,Tidak ada yang mendorong, dia sendiri. ,Apalagi (kasus Freeport) menyebut nama saya. Jokowi marah, saya juga marah. Kalau kita tidak menyetujui (Sudirman), itu dianggap kita membenarkan. ,(Lagian) 9 persen itu terlalu sedikit. (Sambil tertawa).,Jusuf Kalla kontroversial, dan selalu jadi ,bad cop,, sedangkan Joko Widodo adalah ,good cop,? ,Kadang kita harus membuat kebijakan yang tidak populer. Kita harus siap membuat kebijakan yang tidak disukai ataupun disukai. ,Tahun ini ada menteri (Menteri Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman Rizal Ramli) yang suka menyerang Kalla, kenapa ya? ,Kurang kompak lah, pandangan yang berbeda, ataupun niat yang berbeda (Sambil tersenyum lebar).,Sebenarnya tidak dibenarkan juga, saya bilang (ke menteri itu), \u201cEtika apa Anda ini?\u201d ,Tahun ini juga ada menteri (Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan) yang membuat keputusan dan mengagetkan khalayak umum juga kan? ,Soal Go-Jek, Jonan terlalu kaku. Teknologi selalu membuat perubahan dan perubahan selalu lebih cepat daripada peraturan. Peraturan harus selalu diubah. ,Dulu Jakarta, selalu naik dokar, begitu ada mobil naik omlet. Lama-lama ada bis, mati semua omlet. Lalu ada ojek, ada Go-Jek, mati lagi ojek. Besok ada ,subway,, mati semua. ,Kita harus selalu siap. (Kalla mengatakan pada Jonan) Itu motor ,dikir, tiap bulan, kasihlah dia otoritas. Kedua pengemudinya. Tinggal mengganti saja peraturan, dari 4 roda menjadi 2 roda. ,Apa beda menjadi wakil presiden zaman Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono dan Joko Widodo? ,Memang, dulu jelas, sebelum maju ada perjanjian, sesuai dengan pengetahuan masing-masing. Kalau sekarang tidak ada peraturan itu, tetap hampir semua diputuskan lewat rapat. ,Jadi sampai setahun ini rapatnya lebih dari 200 kali. Jadi hampir semua kebijakannya keputusan diambil dalam rapat. Kadang menteri lagi di daerah, besok rapat, bingung dia. ,Tapi itu artinya ada kebersamaan dalam hal pengambilan keputusan. Dulu kita sudah putusin pembagiannya, sekarang satu-dua hari bisa dua-tiga kali rapat. ,Pemberantasan korupsi tahun ini, ada keraguan dari aktivis anti-korupsi. Menurut seorang Jusuf Kalla, pemerintah telah berhasil memenuhi komitmenya dalam bidang ini? ,Soal anti-korupsi, dalam satu kelompok, seakan dia yang paling pantas mewakili gerakan anti-korupsi, nanti kita lihat. Dari ukuran orang yang ditangkap pasti hebat. ,Anda pernah dirawat di Rumah Sakit Cipto Mangunkusumo, ada resolusi kesehatan untuk tahun depan?  ,Enggak ada, ,alhamdulillah, sehat. ,\u2014Rappler.com,BACA JUGA:", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/116921-catatan-akhir-tahun-jusuf-kalla-2015", "title": "Catatan akhir tahun Wakil Presiden Jusuf Kalla", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective"},

They will also be given a posthumous promotion.,While the exact narrative of events have yet to established, officials have said the SAF commandos found themselves in a ,\u201cmisencounter\u201d, with the BIFF, a faction of the MILF.,Citing preliminary reports, Roxas said members of the BIFF attacked SAF commandos, after which government forces had a \u201cmisencounter\u201d with the MILF because they were avoiding BIFF territory. Roxas is also the chairman of the National Police Commission.,Roxas, however, said he was not privy to the operation in Maguindanao. Neither was PNP OIC Espina.

The president, however, did not categorically answer if he gave the go signal for the operation or not.,The PNP has since launched a Board of Inquiry to probe the incident. The MILF has also spearheaded its own independent review of the incident. The board will have to find out why top PNP officials were kept out of the loop.,The MILF and the Philippine government are in the final stages of a peace deal that would establish a new autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao. The development of the deal is now in limbo, following the clash.,At least two senators have withdrawn their support for the Bangsamoro Basic Law, meaning a majority is no longer in favor of the measure. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/82277-mamasapano-slain-pnp-saf-return-home", "title": "Hero\u2019s welcome: Slain PNP-SAF back home", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/174317-rumors-pacquiao-decline-greatly-exaggerated,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/fashion/133835-solenn-heussaff-wedding-dress,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/nation/81883-pnp-saf-maguindanao-terrorists,http://www.rappler.com/nation/81968-pnp-saf-zamboanga-maguindanao"},

Tim Inter Milan dalam laga Coppa Italia melawan Cagliari, 15 Desember 2015. Foto oleh EPA ,JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Inggris dan Italia adalah dua kutub liga sepak bola dunia. Masing-masing memiliki kekhasan sendiri. Secara komersial, Inggris memang masih berkuasa. Tapi soal kompleksitas taktik dan strategi, Negeri Pisa masih diakui sebagai yang paling kompleks.,Di Inggris, penggunaan taktik yang kompleks hanya didominasi klub-klub besar seperti Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, duo Manchester dan Tottenham Hotspur.,Beberapa klub kecil memang melakukannya. Tapi, itu karena pengaruh manajer asing di klub tersebut. Seperti manajer asal Spanyol Quique Sanchez Flores di Watford, Ronald Koeman (Belanda) di Southampton atau Roberto Martinez (Spanyol) di Everton dan Slaven Bilic (Kroasia) di West Ham United.,Di Italia, hampir semua klub memiliki kemampuan strategi yang mendalam. Bahkan klub yang baru promosi ke Serie A tiga musim lalu, Sassuolo, pun memiliki kemampuan taktik yang tak bisa diremehkan. ,Liga Italia bisa melakukan itu bukan karena para pelatih impor. Tapi justru karena ,allenatore ,(pelatih) domestik. Para pelatih Italia adalah pemikir sepak bola. Mereka adalah produk budaya sepak bola yang mendalam dan kompleks.,Jika di Inggris, hanya empat manajer yang berasal dari dalam negeri. Di Italia, justru hanya ada dua pelatih asing. Mereka adalah pelatih Fiorentina Paulo Sousa (Portugal) dan pelatih AS Roma Rudi Garcia (Prancis).,Kompleksitas strategi di Italia itu pernah diungkapkan asisten pelatih Jose Mourinho, Rui Faria, dalam sebuah wawancara di stasiun televisi Sky Sports.,Asisten pelatih Mourinho sejak di klub Portugal Uniao Leiria itu mengatakan, perubahan strategi di Italia terjadi hampir setiap menit pertandingan.,\u201cMenit ini mereka mengganti begini. Kami kemudian merespons juga dengan beberapa perubahan. Kemudian lawan juga menggantinya karena kami juga ikut mengganti. Begitu terus yang terjadi selama 90 menit pertandingan,\u201d kata Faria.,Faria di Italia selama dua musim pada 2008/2009 dan 2009/2010. Dia mendampingi Mourinho di Inter Milan dan ikut berkontribusi mempersembahkan ,treble winners ,(tiga gelar dalam semusim), ,untuk ,La Beneamata,\u2014julukan Inter\u2014pada musim keduanya.,\u201cDari semua negara yang pernah saya datangi, sepak bola Italia adalah yang paling sulit,\u201d ujar lelaki 40 tahun tersebut menambahkan.,Perang taktik yang ketat itupula yang membuat konstelasi di klasemen terus berubah. Hingga ,giornata ,(pekan) ke-17, pemuncak klasemen alias ,capolista ,berubah sebanyak 9 kali! Dan hingga pekan ini, belum ada yang bisa menjadi ,capolista ,lebih dari tiga ,giornata,.,Karena itu, Inter Milan yang kini menguasai singgasana Serie A pun belum tentu bakal langgeng kekuasaannya. Sebab, pasukan Roberto Mancini itu ditempel ketat Fiorentina dan Napoli yang hanya berselisih satu poin di belakang. Di posisi keempat, ada juara bertahan Juventus dengan selisih 3 angka.,Lantas, siapa yang akan keluar menjadi juara di akhir musim?,Inter Milan paling berpeluang juara,Bagaimanapun, Inter Milan adalah klub yang paling berpotensi menjuarai Serie A musim ini. Mereka sudah mulai stabil di musim kedua kembalinya Roberto Mancini di kursi kepelatihan klub tersebut.,Setelah musim lalu hanya finis di peringkat kedelapan, musim ini Inter mulai konsisten di lima besar. Sejak pekan pertama, klub berjuluk ,Nerazzurri, tak pernah keluar dari lima besar. Bahkan, sejak pekan ke-15 mereka memimpin klasemen.,Salah satu kunci sukses mereka adalah pembenahan fundamental Mancini. Mantan manajer Manchester City itu memperkuat barisan pertahanan dengan mendatangkan bek tangguh Atletico Madrid Miranda. Selain itu, bek kanan Martin Montoya dipinjam dari Barcelona.,Begitu juga gelandang bertahan Felipe Melo. Pemain Brasil itu dibawa ke Giussepe Meazza, markas Inter, dari Galatasaray demi memperkuat pertahanan.,Selain mendatangkan pemain baru, Mancini juga mulai mengubah gaya bermain Inter. Rival sekota AC Milan itu cenderung bermain konservatif dan lebih banyak bertahan. Para bek sayap pun tidak terlalu banyak ,overlapping,.,Hasilnya, Inter menjadi tim yang paling sedikit kebobolan. Total jumlah kebobolan mereka hanya 11 gol. Bandingkan dengan Napoli (13 gol), dan Fiorentina (15 gol).,Satu-satunya klub Italia yang tidak pernah terdegradasi dalam sejarah Serie A itu kini tinggal bermain konsisten. Mancini juga harus lebih adaptif dengan dengan perubahan taktik. Sebab, lawan bakal terus berusaha membongkar skema mereka.,Musim ini, sudah lima kali Inter berganti formasi. Di awal musim mereka seperti sudah menemukan stabilitas dalam 4-3-1-2. Bermain dengan tiga gelandang bertahan membuat lawan sangat sulit menerobos pertahanan mereka.,Namun, skema tersebut membuat produktivitas gol Inter minim.  Mereka lantas berubah menjadi 4-3-3, 3-5-2, 4-4-2, dan 4-2-3-1. Skema terakhir inilah yang konsisten mereka lakukan di tiga laga terakhir.,Masalah Inter saat ini tinggal menajamkan lini serang mereka. Sebab, jumlah gol mereka adalah yang paling sedikit dari lima besar klub papan atas. Mauro Icardi dan kawan-kawan hanya mencetak 23 gol.,Karena itulah, mereka berupaya untuk mendatangkan Ezequiel Lavezzi di bursa transfer Januari ini. Tapi, negosiasi dengan ,winger ,Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) itu masih terkendala gaji. Kabarnya, Inter bakal angkat tangan jika pemain Argentina itu meminta lebih dari EUR 3 juta (sekitar Rp 45 miliar) per tahun.,Jika ingin meraih gelar liga, saat inilah momen yang tepat bagi Inter. Sebab, baru kali ini persaingan gelar juara Serie A begitu terbuka. Sepanjang empat musim sebelumnya, Juventus terlalu dominan.,Dan karena dominasi Juventus mulai luntur pasca kepergian ,allenatore ,Antonio Conte dan beberapa pemain kunci (Andrea Pirlo, Carlos Tevez, dan Arturo Vidal), Inter harus mengambil kesempatan itu musim ini.,Bagaimana dengan klub lain?,Fiorentina kurang variasi, Napoli terlalu bergantung Higuain,Peluang menjuarai Serie A sejatinya masih terbuka untuk tiga klub lain, yakni Fiorentina, Napoli, dan sang juara bertahan Juventus. Namun, mereka memiliki persoalan yang harus diselesaikan jika ingin memenanginya.,Fiorentina, misalnya. ,Allenatore ,Paulo Sousa kurang adaptif dalam mengatur formasi. Sepanjang musim, tim berjuluk ,La Viola ,itu hanya memiliki dua alternatif skema, yakni 4-2-3-1 dan 3-4-2-1.,Padahal, untuk mengarungi Serie A yang ketat dengan perang strategi, skema yang monoton berpeluang kandas. Apalagi, Sousa terlalu terobsesi dengan penggunaan tiga bek.,Sementara itu, Napoli juga memiliki masalah. Klub berjuluk ,Il Partinopei ,itu terlalu bergantung pada striker Gonzalo Higuain. Bomber Argentina itu sudah menjadi ,capocannonieri ,(pencetak gol terbanyak) Serie A dengan 16 gol. Itu artinya, hampir 50 persen gol ,La Viola ,datang dari Higuain.,Bagaimana dengan Juventus?,Klub milik konglomerat keluarga Agnelli itu mengawali Serie A dengan banyak masalah hingga hanya meraih lima poin dari enam laga pertama. Akibatnya, mereka baru bisa menembus lima besar Serie A di pekan ke-14.,Namun, pasukan Massimiliano Allegri mulai menemukan konsistensinya. Dalam tujuh laga terakhir, mereka terus meraih ,streak ,alias kemenangan beruntun. Inter harus mewaspadai mereka karena sejak 28 Oktober belum ada yang bisa mengalahkan Juventus, bahkan menahan seri sekalipun.,Klub berjuluk ,La Vecchia Signora ,(Si Nyonya Tua) itu bisa kembali meraih gelar jika Inter, Fiorentina, dan Napoli terus kehilangan poin. Sebab, tidak ada yang bisa menghentikan Juventus jika mental juara mereka telah pulih.,Karena itu, kekalahan Inter 1-2 dari Lazio pada 20 Desember lalu tidak boleh lagi terjadi. Itu jika mereka ingin meraih gelar Serie A untuk kali pertama sejak enam tahun lalu. \u2014 ,Rappler.com,BACA JUGA: ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/117894-prediksi-seriea-liga-italia-2016", "title": "Prediksi paruh kedua Serie A: Inter Milan berpeluang akhiri puasa gelar", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa"},

They did not die in vain.\",Espina did not elaborate, citing \"sketchy\" information from the field. \"What we know so far is that there is an ongoing operation in the area against a high-value target believed to be behind the recent spate of bombings in Central Mindanao,\" he added.,Initial reports on Sunday noon from two Rappler sources said that the SAF teams conducted \"law enforcement operations against [a] high value target\" in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao, at 2:30 am Sunday.

Our mandate is to set minimum wages,\" the board said in a resolution.,The board asked petitioners to conform with standards prescribed by law in petitions that will be filed in the future.,Trade Union Congress of the Philippines-Nagkaisa's Alan Tanjusay, however, asked the regional wage board to \"show the formula they used as basis for the new wage order and subject it to healthy discussion.\",\"They better explain it to the workers immediately or else their lack of credibility may invite confusion, if not incite chaos, particularly among poor workers,\" he said, calling the P15 increase \"revolting.\",TUCP was among the petitioners before the RTWPB.,On the other hand, Kilusang Mayo Uno chair Elmer Labog said such, \"region-based wage hikes don\u2019t address the attacks carried out against the minimum wage in the country for decades.\",\"We are fighting for the implementation of a National Minimum Wage in the amount of P16,000 monthly to give workers some immediate relief and to turn back the attacks against the minimum wage throughout the country,\u201d Labog said.,He added that the wage hike is insufficient, considering increases in the prices of basic commodities and the fare hike in Metro Manila trains. ,'Let market forces decide',Reacting to the wage hike, lawyer Noel Balsicas of the People Management Association of the Philippines said the mandated minimum wage is an outmoded means of wage determination.,\"This will have an effect on other personnel who are not directly affected by the increase through wage compression or wage distortion,\" he said.,Employers are now forced to increase the salary of a worker with a typically higher rate than a minimum wage earner to \"restore the seniority of that individual.\",Balsicas said it is better to let market forces decide salary increases instead of the government mandating them.,\"It also backfires in a way to the workers,\" he added, explaining that manufacturers are now forced to increase the price of their products and services to sustain the higher salaries of their workers.,This creates an \"additional pressure on the cost of living,\" he said, calling it a \"chicken-and-egg situation.\",Around 40% of manufacturing cost is labor, he added. ,\u2013, Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/87217-wage-hike-approved-metro-manila-workers", "title": "P15 minimum wage hike for Metro Manila workers approved", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/specials/miss-universe/133424-pia-wurtzbach-dr-mike-relationship-status-mikhail-varshavski,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/63518-nutritional-status-filipinos,http://www.rappler.com/business/55548-exemption-filing-tax-bir,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/161229-pacquiao-next-fight-uae-horn-promoter-australia"},

Photo by Karlos Manlupig/AFP,MANILA, Philippines (Updated) \u2013 After the signing, the groundwork begins. Rebels will soon have to give up their firearms, while politicians must do their share to craft and pass a law that makes peace more acceptable than war.,The success of the peace deal signed Thursday, March 27, by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) depends largely on the a,bility of the Aquino administration to prevail upon Congress to pass the Bangsamoro law in the spirit that the panels agreed on and, equally, on the ,sincerity of the MILF to drop the armed struggle. (READ: ,'Bangsamoro deal illegal, creates substate' \u2013 Miriam,),\",Hindi komo nagpirmahan na, tapos na. Hindi. May mga ,stages, pa 'yan eh. Mga, phases,\" ,Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin told reporters in an interview in March. (They may have signed but it's not over yet. There are stages. There are phases.),The government and MILF panels envision a new order in the areas notorious for decades-long conflict. Where guns are said to be more valuable than wives, MILF fighters ,w,ill lay down their arms to a third party. ,Where the infamous ,Ampatuan massacre, happened, private armies will be disbanded. ,Military presence in the region will be reduced. Peace and order will be the responsibility of the yet-to-be-created Bangsamoro Police Force, which is civilian in character. (,Read the program for normalization in the Bangsamoro below,),This has never been done in post-war Philippines \u2013 in the scale that the agreement envisions.,The MILF claims to have 11,000 combatants, although this will now be the subject of verification. ,They are concentrated in the MILF's bailiwick, central Mindanao, although some units are also in western Mindanao. Other threat groups like the rogue Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) members and the private armies will have to be disarmed, too.,Military troops are also concentrated in Mindanao \u2013 Western Mindanao Command (Wesmincom) and Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom) \u2013 because of the threat groups there. ,The 6th Infantry Division that covers MILF bailiwick central Mindanao has 6,000 troops.,It won't be easy,Until the Bangsamoro Police Force is set up, the military and the MILF will be jointly tracking and documenting private armies and other armed groups, controlling the flow of loose firearms, and making sure ceasefire is sustained.,The MILF command has to explain to its members what is at stake and what they must do for peace, Gazmin explained.,Decommissioning is the part where the MILF is expected to exert more effort because it won't be easy.,\"Everybody is observing. The ball is with the MILF. The burden of proof is on them,\" said a military officer who spent years in central Mindanao. He refused to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the issue.,HISTORIC: President Benigno S. Aquino III huddles with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) representatives, led by chairman Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, for a group photo souvenir during a courtesy call at the President\u2019s Hall of the Malaca\u00f1an Palace. Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau,A lot hinges on what will happen to the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), the breakaway group of the MILF opposed to the deal. The officer said both panels cannot allow the BIFF to grow and become the new MILF, referring to the latter's split with the MNLF in the 1970s. The MILF would grow to become the more dominant rebel organization.,Colonel Dickson Hermoso, spokesperson of the 6th ID, is confident that BIFF has weakened. ,With the help of the MILF, the military last month overran BIFF camps and set up detachments to make sure the BIFF won't return to the area. (READ: ,Military sets up detachments in captured BIFF camps,),\"Some of them might even go back [to the MILF],\" he told Rappler.,The military officer also thinks the MILF should take the lead in future operations against BIFF, other threat grous, the private armies and even in ,rido, or clan wars that are prevalent in these areas. The members of these peace \"spoilers\" are their own relatives or friends, the officer said.,\"If the MILF fails to address this, then we are back to square one,\" he said.,Realistic expectations,Military officers interviewed by Rappler are realistic about the challenges ahead, given the peace agreement's ambitious timeline. The signing is the first step in a process that, they say, will take time. ,\"I don\u2019t think it will happen [complete decommissioning]. There will be an attempt to do it. They are all armed. We are talking about changing a culture and tradition. It won't be so easy,\" said the military officer.,\"If you can demobilize them by 50%, that will be great,\" said another officer.,The current cooperation between government forces and the MILF is already a success \"that could not have been imagined 10 years ago,\" he added.,Hermoso, who hails from Cotabato City, is celebrating. \"Being a stakeholder, I have high hopes. There are new challenges in ending the 4-decades long conflict but the confidence is high. You can feel that the communities are very supportive,\" he said.,An officer assigned in the area in the 1990s recalled how bitter the relationship was between the military and MILF commanders. ,Today, he noted, these commanders have become friends, sharing stories of their previous encounters.,This is a marked change from the conditions that gave rise to the all-out war against the MILF more than a decade ago, when Joseph Estrada was president. During that bloody campaign, the military crushed Camp Abubakar, the main headquarters of the MILF, and closed all avenues to peace.,Part of the change can be attributed to how Filipino soldiers have learned to respect Muslim culture.,\"There is a realization also that the problems of insurgency are multi-faceted. It is not the military alone that can solve the problem. There are economic issues, political, religion. It\u2019s complex that there are legislative issues that need to be answered,\" added military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Zagala.,The Ampatuan massacre in 2009 \u2013 the world's worst case of election violence that embarrassed the military \u2013 may have been the catalyst that forced the military to reflect and give the peace process a chance. ,Military men in the area were accused of enjoying cozy ties with the Ampatuan clan. The Ampatuans, on the other hand, were believed to have been used by the military to run after the MILF. ,\"It was a turnaround. It was a moment of opportunity. I cannot explain it. It changed the attitude of soldiers. Ten years ago, it was a question of who has the most guns. After the massacre, it was different,\" said the military officer. ,Warehouse,Decommissioning is the most emotional issue for the MILF.,In the words of its chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal, the MILF ceases to exist as an armed group and starts positioning itself as a \"social movement.\" (READ: ,What happens to MILF after peace deal?,),\"All the agreements are substantive and important and very, very hard, but the issue of normalization is the most sensitive, emotional...As far as I know, it entails a lot of sacrifices on the part of the MILF because to build real peace in Mindanao, we have to decommission our forces,\" Iqbal said.,The wording is carefully selected. It's not disarmament, which implies surrender. Decommissioning means MILF firearms will be put \"beyond use,\" probably stored in a warehouse, depending on the recommendation of the Independent Decommissioning Body (IDB).,In contrast, when the MNLF signed a peace agreement with the Ramos administration, there was no demobilization or disarmament plan. \",There was only the plan of integration. We cannot integrate them all,\" recalled Zagala.,MNLF fighters joined the police and the military, but not all were qualified. Those who were not integrated managed to keep their firearms. In due time, the disgruntled ex-rebels returned to fighting government.,Convinced they were left out in the peace process, MNLF rebels seized Zamboanga City in September last year, paralyzing the city and causing the worst security nightmare for the Aquino government.,The siege of Sabah by the Royal Security Force of the late Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram III was also linked to the peace process because it was mounted by former MNLF members who had complained of the MILF's silence on the Sabah issue. , ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/53994-real-peace-decommissioning-challenges", "title": "Real peace means the guns will have to go away", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/171463-nadine-lustre-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/nation/49041-maguindanao-massacre-aquino-sore-point,http://www.rappler.com/nation/49757-military-detachments-biff-camps"},

(READ: ,Marawi under siege: It's like 'looking at Aleppo,),Major General Rolando Bautista, commander of the military's 1st infantry division that has jurisdiction over the Lanao provinces, said the troops were not prepared for the sniping skills of the enemy. \u201cOne sniper can paralyze the movement of a whole company, even a battalion,\u201d he said.,Military tanks can only do so much, because the terrorists are armed with .50 caliber machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades that can pierce through metal.,Thus the tactical move to resort to airstrikes, which has caused much tension between the military and residents. ,\"Natatakot ako sa kanila dahil wala naman pinipili 'yan eh,. ,Ang mga, targets nila is, panay, guesswork ,nila 'yun eh,\" ,said Bishop Edwin dela Pe\u00f1a.

According to the military, the terrorists were acting upon the instructions of ISIS leaders in the Middle East who want a refuge in Southeast Asia for their fighters, as ISIS continues to lose territory in the Middle East.,A video of Hapilon and the Maute brothers planning an attack on the first day of Ramadan was also recovered in a safe house.

In Marawi, the enemies attacked various parts of city. And they were mostly residents themselves who grew up here.,In Zamboanga, the houses occupied by enemies were mostly made of light materials. Here, the terrorists occupied Banggolo, where the houses are made of hardened concrete. Even airstrikes could not demolish them. ,\"In the Zamboanga siege, we were clearing houses built with light materials. Here, we are clearing hardened buildings. There are even tunnels,\" said Western Mindanao Command chief Lieutenant General Carlito Galvez.,The siege of Zamboanga City lasted 3 weeks, killing 19 government forces and 208 rebels, and dislocating 24,000 families.,In Marawi, 62 government forces have been killed as of June 18. This is already 3 times more than the deaths in Zamboanga. Up to 257 terrorists have been reported killed and almost all of the city\u2019s 200,000 have been evacuated.,And it's not over yet.,PAST THE BRIDGE, DANGER LURKS. The military announced they have the bridges entering Banggolo under control. But enemy snipers continue to prevent humanitarian workers from entering the area.

It would take days of airstrikes and troop advances before the military took control and pushed the terrorists to the other side of the Agus River. ,To this day, humanitarian workers could not cross the bridge because of the threat of enemy snipers. Rescue and retrieval are practically at a standstill.,But as ,hunger becomes a problem among trapped residents,, local government officials have encouraged them to risk getting hit by the snipers. \u201cEither they die inside the house or they die trying to get out,\u201d said Zia Alonto Adiong, spokesman of the provincial Crisis Management Committee.,Stray bullets from supposed sympathizers continue to reach the capitol, the city hall, and the headquarters.,A ,14-year-old boy praying at a mosque, was killed near the brigade headquarters while an Australian journalist ,survived a bullet ,that hit his neck while taking a video from inside the provincial capitol.,HOSTAGED.

Bangsamoro implementing panel chair Irene Santiago said they are reviewing tactics to make the rescue plan more effective.,It's a tough balancing act, said Dureza. The military is hesitant to impose temporary ceasefires to allow rescuers to go because it allows the terrorists to reposition.,But Galvez said their priority is the safety of trapped civilians and hostages.,3rd week,The Marawi clashes erupted on May 23 following a military raid that attempted to arrest Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was said to have brought his forces to the Lanao area late last year to link up with the Maute Group.

But the military said it's still not safe.,Looting is also a big cause of concern, but Galvez blamed professional looters. ,\"Kukuha talaga 'yan. Naka-van pa,\", he said.  ,Vehicles packed with luggage have attempted to enter the city, but are turned away at checkpoints.,Barangay defense system,After a meeting with Dureza, Marawi City Mayor Majul Usman Gandamra announced coordination with the military is underway to allow barangays to boost the presence of security forces in already cleared areas.,\"Yesterday, we had a meeting with our barangay officials over the concerns of constituents, especially about securing their properties and house. ,Nagkaroon po tayo ng ,(We had) coordination with the military and now we are processing an organization composed of barangay officials,\" the mayor said.,\"Sila po ang magiging countepart ng ating Armed Forces sa pag-secure ng kanilang respective barangays,\", he added. (They will be the counterpart of our Armed Forces in securing their respective barangays.),Galvez called it the \"barangay defense system,\" essentially tapping private armed groups to become force multipliers. He assigned the 1st Infantry Battalion to do this. ,It serves two purposes. The volunteers will guard properties from looters while helping make sure terrorists do not penetrate the military's dragnet.,The provincial capitol, previously empty and quiet, is back in business as more and more local officials show up to assert their power over the military that has practically taken over governance in the city the past two weeks. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/172084-marawi-tension-hostages-residents-impatient", "title": "Hundreds still trapped in Marawi as crisis enters 3rd week", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/nation/171413-propaganda-shows-marawi-priest-echoing-kidnappers-demand,http://www.rappler.com/nation/171473-samira-gutoc-tomawis-bangsamoro-resignation"},

PNP chief Ronald dela Rosa admits law enforcement in Marawi City could have been better, as government troops try to flush out local terrorists. File photo by Bobby Lagsa/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) on Wednesday, June 28, admitted a \"law enforcement failure\" in Marawi even before local terror groups and their sympathizers tried to take control of the city over a month ago.,\"In other major urban centers, we were prepared. In Marawi, they were really there. You may call it a slight failure on law enforcement when it comes to Marawi, if I'm being honest,\" said Director General Ronald dela Rosa during a panel interview aired live on the News 5 Facebook page.,The failure, said Dela Rosa, was cops' inability to curb the spread of loose firearms in the city, a situation he blamed on the local \"culture.\",The PNP chief, who was born, raised, and spent most of his career in Mindanao, said it was common for local politicians and other powerful local figures to have well-armed militias of their own.,Dela Rosa was being quizzed about the government's prior intelligence on the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups' plan to take over Marawi City.

What we underestimated was the support they would get. We were gaining victory in flushing them out of Butig but they ended up moving out to Marawi. The support, we were unable to estimate,\" said Dela Rosa.,\"They had accumulated bullets, bombs were already prepared,\" he added.,Tens of thousands of families have been ,forced to flee Marawi,, as military operations \u2013 including air strikes \u2013 continue against the terrorists, who earlier pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS).,One of the solutions to the law enforcement problem in Marawi, said Dela Rosa, was to deploy cops from Luzon or the Visayas to the city. Dela Rosa explained cops who hail from Marawi are sometimes afraid to enforce the law, lest they begin rido, or feuds between families.,More soldiers and police are being ,deployed to Marawi, from all over the country. Dela Rosa said recently, troops from the PNP's Special Action Force based in Zamboanga City were tapped to reinforce police efforts in the city.,Duterte placed the entire Mindanao island ,under martial law, just hours after the Marawi clashes erupted.

Senator Risa Hontiveros reminds senators Richard Gordon and Juan Miguel Zubiri of their changing stance on the need for a joint session on martial law.  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It was a heated debate on whether or not there should be a joint congressional session to debate on martial law, with two senators being called out for their apparent flip-flopping on the issue.,Minority senator Risa Hontiveros reminded senators Richard Gordon and Juan Miguel Zubiri, known allies of President Rodrigo Duterte, on their 2009 stand favoring a joint public session.,In 2009, Zubiri and Gordon were in favor of a joint public session to deliberate on then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's martial law in Maguindanao. But 8 years after, the two had a change of heart, saying there is no need to convene Congress to discuss Duterte's proclamation. (READ: ,No joint session on martial law? Congress 'shields' Duterte,),\"If I would be allowed to refresh the memory of the good gentleman from Bukidnon. In 2009, in the discussion in our Senate on this very question, the good gentleman from Bukidnon said, I quote: ,'Ito po (joint session) ay isang constitutional duty natin. Hindi po natin puwedeng hindi bigyan ng pansin itong joint session na ito dahil it will become bad precedent. Think about the future administrations.', I am sure [he] will recall his prophetic statement at the time,\" Hontiveros said.,(This is our constitutional duty. We cannot ignore this joint session because it will become bad precedent. Think about the future administrations.),A ,transcript of Zubiri's 2009 interview, also showed that he asked the Senate to think of the future in its decision, in case there would be an \"abusive\" president.,\"Forget about this administration. It's already reaching the 6-month term and ending its 6 months of public service. But what about the next administration? ,Kung abusado ang presidente at meron po siyang numerical superior strength sa House of Representatives ang gagawin lang niya is\u2026 Those who want to undermine this process will...say hindi na tayo kailangang mag-meeting dahil marami namang pumapabor,,\" Zubiri said then, which is a mirror of the present scenario.,(If the president is abusive and he has the numerical superior strength in the House of Representatives, all he would do is... Those who want to undermine this process will just say we don't need to meet because many are in favor.),\"Hindi puwede iyon ,(It should not be). We must make it a precedent ,na ,(that) if there's a martial law declaration the Congress, meaning the Senate and the House of Representatives, should meet and get the explanation of the president,\" he added in 2009.,Zubiri, in response to Hontiveros, said he committed a mistake when he voted for the revocation of martial law in 2009. ,\"At the time I was for revocation of the martial law declaration. I erred in my decision at the time. People make mistakes. If we run after these people with the full force of the law, maybe this would not have been this grave today,\" Zubiri said in defending the change in his stand.,The 2009 martial law, however, was lifted only 8 days after, even before Congress scheduled the vote on the matter.,\"Now I realized the gravity of the situation. This is happening in my home as I mentioned,\u201d he added.,Zubiri said there is an urgent need to declare martial law in Mindanao to neutralize \"terrorists\" and that Duterte must be given leeway to fulfill his mandate.,But Hontiveros remains unconvinced: \"I understand and respect the passion of the gentleman from Bukidnon. Though his opinion may have changed, the Constitution has not.\",Zubiri, in anticipation of online attacks against him, said a joint session had to be convened in 2009 because the chamber then was for the revocation of martial law. In contrast, majority of senators now are in favor of the proclamation.,\"I can clearly recall then. I want to put this on record. ,Baka fake news na naman na ,(There might be fake news that) I was schooled by Senator Risa on my position in 2009. ,Sigurado, gano'n 'yun eh, labanan ng social media, (It's sure to happen. It's like that, the battle on social media). I want to put this on record. At the time, majority of senators were for the revocation. That was the sense of the Senate to revoke, we wanted a joint session but things have changed, and I said, now it's different. Tremendously deterioriated since 2009. ,Nagkamali tayo, nagka-grabe-grabe, nagkaleche-leche na [ang sitwasyon sa Mindanao] ,(We made a mistake, it got worse in Mindanao),\" Zubiri said.,Hontiveros denied \"schooling\" Zubiri but insisted a public official's past statements are important especially on a major issue such as martial law.,\"'Yung mga salitang sinabi noon nananatiling mahalaga sa habang panahon, (The words uttered before remain important in the long term) especially when we're faced with making a decision about similar situations later in the future. No one is schooling anyone,\" Hontiveros said.,Gordon in 2009,Hontiveros also took the time to remind Gordon of his earlier stand.,The lady senator, quoting Gordon's exact words during the joint session in 2009, said: \"To my mind Mr President, if I may be so bold, we are a co-equal branch of government and the Constitution provides that we must review. And therefore, it behooves the executive that she (Arroyo) sends the highest officials involved in the declaration of martial law. ,Lumalabas po rito sa 'di nila pagdalo, lumalabas po rito tila binabalewala ang kahalagahan ng Kongreso, ng House at Senate, sa isang napakahalagang bagay, (It appears now that with their absence, they are ignoring the importance of Congress, of the House and the Senate, on a very significant matter.),Gordon disputed Hontiveros' interpretation, saying he did not refer to any joint session in his statement. Gordon said he uttered those words to refer to the absence of high-ranking officials in the joint session.,\"'Yung sinabi ko noon, panahon na 'yun para tawagin ang mga representante ng Pangulo, 'di pinag-uusapan ang joint session noon. Dito dinadala 'nyo ang usapin sa joint session, malinaw na 'di joint session [ang topic],\", Gordon said.,(What I said then was to call the representatives of the President. The topic then was not about the joint session. Here, you are trying to bring the issue to the joint session when it is not the topic.),Gordon also said there is no point in holding a joint public session because military officials are prohibited from attending it \u2013 something that the lady senator opposed.,\"Maaalala po ninyo noong 2009 may mga AFP officials na inimbita at nagsalita doon sa joint session. Issue noon ay bakit wala si dating pangulong Macapagal-Arroyo. Naaalala ko po dahil andun po ako bilang miyembro ng House of Representatives,\", Hontiveros said.,(You may recall that in 2009, there were AFP officials invited and who spoke during the joint session. The issue then was why former president Macapagal-Arroyo was not present. I remember it because I was there as a member of the House of Representatives.),In the end, the Senate, voting 12-9, ,rejected the minority's proposal for a joint session, with the House of Representatives.,Senators Loren Legarda and Joseph Victor Ejercito both earlier said ,they were in favor of it, but changed their minds during the actual voting. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/171510-hontiveros-gordon-zubiri-martial-law-joint-session", "title": "No to joint session on martial law?
