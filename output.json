A young child waves the national flag as crowds gather in front of the Greek parliament in Athens. Photo by Louisa Gouliamaki AFP ATHENS Greece Greece s anti austerity leaders were back in Athens Friday vowing to keep their promise to renegotiate the country s huge loans despite having little to show after a European tour aimed at winning allies to their cause. We are a sovereign country we have democracy we have a contract with our people we will honour this agreement Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told his hard left Syriza party in their first meeting Thursday since the January 25 elections.In a remarkable show of support thousands of people then gathered outside parliament standing silently in Syntagma Square the scene of violent anti austerity protests in recent years. We have nothing to lose said Stavroula Drakopoulou a 55 year old teacher. An estimated 500 people also gathered in Greece s second city Thessaloniki.Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis visited Paris London Rome Frankfurt Brussels and Berlin in the past six days to try to win over EU leaders to their plan to ease the crushing burden of Greece s debts.The tour began well but ended with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble restating his country s opposition to debt relief and expressing deep scepticism over the Greek government s proposals to restructure its EU IMF loans. We even didn t agree to disagree a downbeat Varoufakis told reporters after talks with Schaeuble in Berlin Thursday.The Greek minister will hope for a more sympathetic ear when he hosts a meeting with US Treasury deputy assistant secretary Daleep Singh later Friday.US President Barack Obama gave Athens a boost last week when he warned against squeezing debt ravaged countries such as Greece whose economy has shrunk by one quarter since 2008.Meanwhile Tsipras must prepare for his first European summit in Brussels on February 12 which will be his first meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Finance ministers from all 19 eurozone countries will gather the day before to discuss the stand off over Greece.In a sign of the pressure Athens is under to reconcile its domestic promises with its obligations to foreign lenders the announcement of the government s legislative agenda was delayed from Saturday to Sunday evening.Blows from Berlin and FrankfurtSyriza is the first anti austerity party to take power in Europe and its opening move to halt key privatisation projects spooked the markets and raised anew fears of Greece being forced out of the eurozone.The government also said it would no longer cooperate with the hated troika of auditors from the European Union European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund who are charged with enforcing the terms of Greece s 240 billion euro 275 billion bailout.Tsipras and Varoufakis later softened their tone and their creative proposals for restructuring Greece s loans were well received by many economists.But Germany viewed by many Greeks as the main obstacle on any easing of austerity remains opposed.A debt write down was not up for discussion Schaeuble said adding that he was unable to hide my scepticism... that some of the measures do not go in the right direction .Varoufakis had earlier made a comparison between Greece and Germany in the 1930s when punitive measures imposed after World War I led to the rise of the Nazis. If you humiliate a proud nation for too long... without light at the end of the tunnel then the pressure will rise in this country at some point Varoufakis said.Athens also took a blow from the ECB which announced late Wednesday that it would no longer take up junk rated Greek government bonds from the country s struggling banks.Europe s stock markets and the euro fell on the news while Greek stocks plunged more than nine percent in early trading on Thursday before recovering to close 3.37 percent down.The Athex general index opened largely stable on Friday.While the move ratcheted up the pressure Athens insisted its banks were safe as long as they still had recourse to emergency liquidity from the Frankfurt based central bank.The ECB has given the green light to make up to 60 billion euros 68.5 billion in emergency liquidity available to Greek lenders.

The player takes control of Grayson a.k.a Sir Galahad as he does The Order's will and completes his missions with either stealth or brute force.,The game's visuals are impressive. At first glance, it is hard to tell whether you are looking at a high budget animated movie or a video game. The texture and lighting are amazing and effective that we often find ourselves immersed at the game's environment and atmosphere. The Order: 1886 redefines the concept of story delivery in video games.,The transition between cinematic storytelling and actual gameplay is seamless and players will find it natural to move Grayson into action while a story event is being played out. This really helps in immersing players into the story. The game runs at 30 frames per second, ideal for achieving a cinematic feel.,The game's third-person-shooter mechanics are standard and easy to get into. The Order: 1886 favors shoot and cover gameplay similar to The Last Of Us and Uncharted.,There are other mechanics thrown in such as bullet time and quick time events. While in cover, you can initiate an attack in slow motion for better control and accuracy. This slow motion attack or bullet time event is breath taking to look at as Grayson switches stance after stance as he guns down each enemy that he sets his sights on.,There are also cinematic quick time events that require the player to press a series of buttons in succession as they are displayed while an event is unfolding in order for Grayson to successfully perform his maneuvers. In some missions, Grayson is required to move stealthily and employ his knife and hand to hand combat expertise for stealth kills.,The game unfortunately does not have a cooperative or multiplayer feature. The lack of this feature is rare for modern shooting games.,It would have been fun to play against other players using the game's armory of steampunk style guns.,The Order: 1886 is set to come out on February 20, 2015., ,Bloodborne,Along with The Order: 1886, we also got to play Bloodborne.,Bloodborne is a third-person action RPG developed by the acclaimed Japanese game developer FROM Software (Armored Core Series, Demons' Souls, Dark Souls 1 and 2). The game was made exclusively for the PS4.,The game takes place on Yharnam, a ruined city cursed with a plague that turns its citizens into monsters. The player takes on the role of the Hunter, a lone adventurer who seeks the rumored medical remedy within the city.,The city of Yharnam is breathtaking. Its design is inspired by victorian architecture and the atmosphere is dark and gothic. The houses and streets lie in a state of ruined beauty, giving these places an eerie and abandoned look. Houses have broken floorboards, cobwebs, tattered piles of books and papers, frayed tapestries, and shattered mirrors. The rooms give off a feeling of history and loneliness, as if decades had passed without any living soul setting foot in their halls. The streets are littered with piles of bricks, broken barrels, abandoned coaches, and rotting corpses.,The environment somewhat evokes scenes from Lovecraftian lore, as if HP Lovecraft himself helped in the level design. The graphics are beautiful and effective in immersing the player in the atmosphere. It's definitely a huge step forward from FROM Software's previous game, Dark Souls II.,We encountered several enemies in the game such as infected city folk and rabid monster dogs. Enemy movement is convincing and unpredictable. Encounters tend to become dangerous when you fight mobs of enemies, often resulting in the death of the player character.,This intense difficulty appears to be the selling point of the game as it rewards players who learn from their mistakes and take the time to learn the game's combat system.,Throwing pebbles at enemies to lure them one by one was a strategy we came up with after suffering several defeats.,The Hunter can equip two weapons, one in each hand. In our case, the character we used had an axe for the right hand weapon and an old firearm on the left. The firearm resembled an old flintlock pistol, just like the ones you would see on pirate movies.,Combat is challenging since it requires you to read your opponent's moves and strike when they are vulnerable. There are no shields in this game so you will need to dodge and roll to evade enemy attacks. This kind of mechanic teaches the player to be careful and avoid being over zealous when attacking.,DEMO. Sony's Arata Naito (L) talks with Rappler's Michan Lorenzo (R) as she tries out the two new games. ,We asked Naito Arata, Sony Asia Region Marketing Manager, a few questions about Bloodborne during the demo:,Rappler:, Is this game related to the Dark Souls series?,Arata:, Well it's being created by the famed company, FROM Software, but we see this game as some sort of spiritual successor to PS3's Demons' Souls.,Rappler:, Is this going to have the same brand of difficulty as the other FROM software game like Demons' Souls and Dark Souls?,Arata:, It's difficult but we don't want to describe it as a difficult game. Again, it's a challenging game but by observing the environment and the enemies you can always find out how to survive. I'm not a super gamer and my reflexes is not super good but I can survive and beat the enemies because I can understand how enemies will move.,Overall, Bloodborne promises to be a rewarding game to beat. It is set to be initially released on March 24, 2015. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/83149-the-order-1886-bloodborne-ps4-impressions", "title": "First impressions: The Order: 1886 and Bloodborne", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating"},

Dovann Arrabis said his family inspired him to study hard and make the top 10 list of the civil engineering licensure exams. Photo by Dale Israel    ,CEBU CITY, Philippines \u2013 It was the crucial last semester of his 5-year civil engineering course when Super Typhoon Yolanda left his family homeless.,Dovann Arrabis was studying in Cebu City at the time 120 kilometers away from his hometown of Daanbantayan where his family was still living at the time. It was difficult for him to be far from his family, knowing that the eye of the typhoon was nearing his town.  ,But his hard work and perseverance prevailed in spite of the devastation Yolanda caused him and his family., ,Arrabis placed 10th among all board passers nationwide who took the May 2014 Civil Engineering Licensure Examination and was one of the two students from Cebu Technological University (CTU) who made it to the top 10.,Early afternoon on February 6, the new civil engineer was among those recognized at the capitol for being a successful scholar of the Cebu provincial government. For more than 10 years, the capitol has been providing financial assistance and scholarships for the province's top high school students who want to pursue higher education.,Arrabis, who was receiving a monthly allowance of only P2,000 ($45), recalled how difficult it was to study while his family was living in tents at home.   ,\u201cPagka ugma adtong Yolanda, niuli dayun ko sa amoa kay nabalaka kaayo ko sa akong pamilya, (A day after Yolanda struck, I went home worried to check on my family),\u201d said Arrabis, who \u2013 at the time \u2013 was working on finishing his college degree in the evening, while studying for his licensure exam in the morning.,Overcoming odds, ,The eye of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) was near Daanbantayan when it made landfall in northern Cebu in November 2013. The town lost communication and many of its roads became impassable. Hundreds of families lost their homes because of the record-breaking strong winds.,Arrabis said that because of the typhoon, he stopped going to school and stopped reviewing for about two months to help his family recover.,\u201c,Naguol kaayo ko ato niuli, after duha ka buwan naka-recover rapud ko,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I was shocked when I went home. After two months, I was able to recover.) He explained that the will to improve his family's living conditions inspired him to stay focused. ,When he returned to school, Arrabis did not waste time and hit the books immediately. \u201c,Mao to nga sige lang gyud ko ug tuon, tig kadlawn na ko makatulog, kung daot ko ron, mas daot pa ko sauna,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I would study until dawn and was even skinnier before.) ,\u201c,Syempre ang pamilya gyud akong inspirasyon ,(Of course, my family is my inspiration),\u201d said Arrabis, whose father is a carpenter and fisherman. His mother stays at home to look after his other siblings, the youngest of whom is 10 years old. ,Inspiration,Arrabis remembered the first time he got to the city as he entered the CTU-main campus. He saw tarpaulins of achievers and topnotchers being displayed at the gates and around the school.,\u201c,Nakapangutana ko ug kung ako naa diha pud unya, unsa kahay feeling,?\u201d (If my face appears on that tarpaulin, how would that feel like?) That was the question, he said, that guided him all throughout college.,After passing the licensure and making it to the Top 10, he said he was so happy and proud when he walked around the campus with everybody smiling and knowing him. More than that, he said his parents were proud of him.,Magna cum laude,Now working with the Department of Social Welfare and Development regional office for infrastructure projects, Arrabis is earning a basic pay of P29,000 ($654) a month since October, his first job offer. ,He now uses his earnings to continue to support his family. He also graduated magna cum laude at the CTU.,At the capitol, Arrabis got a medal, a plaque and cash incentives totaling about P50,000 ($1,127.89) in a ceremony attended by Governor Hilario Davide III and Vice Governor Agnes Magpale., ,Each college scholar of the capitol, chosen among the marginalized families in the towns, got cash incentives between P5,000-P50,000 ($112-$1,127.89) for finishing school. The amount received varies depending on the student's achievement and for passing licensure exams.,At the time, he must have felt truly proud. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/83189-cebuano-yolanda-survivor-engineers", "title": "Cebuano Yolanda survivor among top 10 civil engineers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/139042-robredo-federalism-questions,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation"},

But going further back Luneta, calls for the President\u2018s resignation were already regular column fodders. In fact, even before Aquino could clock in a hundred days in office, some quarters had already demanded his resignation.,But why such a national \"penchant\"?,Many argue that our president exercises more powers, or that he is more powerful, than US president Barack Obama, as the former virtually controls the entire bureaucracy and has a vast influence that extends to Congress and the Supreme Court.,In comparison, we know how Obama was power-checked, others say check-mated, by the Republican-dominated and largely uncooperative Lower House, when majority of its members refused to fund the federal budget which resulted in a government shutdown in late 2013. The US Lower House, in effect, not only held hostage federal funding but more glaringly handed Obama an in-your-face \u201cwe are as powerful as you are, dude\u201d statement.,To better appreciate the vast powers and influence of our president, we refer to the impeachment of former chief justice Renato Corona as its almost perfect manifestation. I say almost, because public outrage, the political interests of senator-judges (vis-\u00e0-vis the upcoming midterm elections at that time), and Corona\u2019s own undoing via his \"unguarded\" testimony, among others, were in play.,The not-so-secret presidential push and inspiration, aside from \"clear instructions\" to allies in both houses of Congress, added up to the pressure for expedited proceedings.,Yet the vast powers of the president are held together by a delicate mantle of public trust, the maintenance or erosion of which can be as fickle as the weather gets, if we go by the latest round of trust survey ratings.,Regardless of the changing public mood, however, one thing remains constant: that the power enjoyed by the incumbent is contingent on the trust the public continually bestows on the office and its occupant, but really more so on the latter. This is, at least, in theory. And this is where the problem lies.,RESIGN. Filipino students hold placards calling for the resignation of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III after he delivers his second televised address on February 6, 2015.  ,We reckon that the election of Benigno Aquino III in 2010, while phenomenal on so many levels, has not much to do with his vision for the Philippines or how his program of action could register growth beyond his term. Rather, it has more to do with sentiments of people betrayed and shortchanged by his predecessor \u2013 a people desperate in their search for a leader who personified the complete opposite of the one they were about to replace.,In sum, the people placed their trust on the one man they believe would, could, and should cure the inherited ills from the Arroyo administration. This is hardly surprising at all under our patronage-driven and personality-based politics. Thus began the reign of Aquino as superman and president.,We cannot avoid discussing presidential resignation by not examining the failures of our political institutions, as well as open the conversation on the numerous attempts by various sectors to strengthen them. The institutional failures provide perfect havens to patronage and corruption, and until we do something fundamentally difficult to destroy these lairs, we will spend the rest of our productive lives digging deeper holes than plugging the leak, so to speak.,But to say that we preserve the status quo in the absence of a leader who is of the same mold as President Aquino is utterly irresponsible, if not downright stupid, and tantamount to insulting the millions, okay the thousands, among us who are better qualified to run the affairs of State.,Our aversion and resistance to presidential resignation is not without basis. For one, our unsteady political institutions still remain prone to subjugation by power wielders who come and go every 6 years or so, and whose combined tenures, so far, have only served to undermine rather than strengthen these supposedly impersonal democratic and therefore accessible institutions.,Understandably, there are many among us whose aversion is influenced by the character of the beneficial successor. (Being an institutionalist, this is the least of my fears.) What feeds more aversion is the uncertainty of the readiness of our institutions \u2013 unsteady many of them are \u2013 to once again be subjected to another round of changes before they could find traction as they undergo rehabilitation after a long period of \"maltreatment\" by previous administrations.,To be fair to the second Aquino administration, efforts were undertaken to flesh out results of its strategy, ,Daang Matuwid,. It may be devoid of vision, but ,Daang Matuwid, rallies people around one common cause and that is reforming public institutions. Whether these efforts have degraded patronage and minimized corruption is a different story altogether.,When Pope Francis came to visit the Philippines, Facebook was flooded with posters bearing the \u201cPope Francis for President\u201d slogan, maybe simply for being such an inspiring and unifying figure to a divided people.,Well, I have a bad news for them: even if Pope Francis succeeded President Aquino by some anomaly, chances are he will also fail just the same under our system as it stands, right as you read this. There is only one way a perceived good leader can succeed in a bad system, situation, or institution: he must reform it first, if not transform it.,So while no one holds the exclusive franchise to good governance, is there someone who can or would guarantee its continuity? That was a trap question actually.,Let me rephrase that by asking rather objectively, impersonally: Can our institutions afford to absorb, adjust, and manage (with relative ease?) the constant shifting of directions and priorities from one administration to the next in such a short period without losing focus on the core deliverables?,I hope each of us can muster our own answers and find our priorities of engagement. I have found mine in the last five words in the preceding paragraph that I believe can last me well beyond 2016. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Tony D.

That is why I started up Zenith Soccer Tours, to give young kids an experience they will never forget.\u201d,Gier\u2019s program will be running football camps that will give participants a chance to stay at the world-class Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre where high caliber coaches from professional clubs in the UK will coach them.,Zenith Soccer will also take them to a tour of the different football stadiums in London to watch how top English clubs train and play., ,The culminating activity of the whole expedition will be a four-team mini tournament, one team of which will be from a professional football academy,According to the Azkals skipper, he believes the activities his program will provide will not just assist aspiring football players in improving their game but also help them become better individuals.,\u201cI want to give these youngsters some memories they will never forget.  I am a firm believer that experiences like our camp and exposure to different environments and cultures at a young age will help develop and shape these children to become more well-rounded individuals, helping to give them confidence to really express who they want to be.\u201d,The 34-year old Philippine international explained although he is still not keen on retiring, he established Zenith Soccer as a way of planning ahead for his life after football.,\u201cI am not ready to hang my boots up just yet but I am getting to the stage in my career where I need to think about life after playing.  I firmly believe in this program and it is not only a way of me staying connected with football but also a way for me to help develop the grassroots potential that our Filipino based kids have.  ,\u201cThey [kids] will ultimately be the generation on which the success of football in the Philippines depends, and if I can help in some way to make sure that football continues to grow then I will be happy.\u201d,Gier noted he is currently in contact with football academies in the Philippines with the hopes of having future partnerships with Filipino clubs to help boost the local grassroots program. ,To find out more about ,Zenith Soccer Tours, you may log onto their webite at ,www.zenith-soccertours.co.uk, or email Rob Gier at ,info@zenith-soccertours.co.uk,. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/football/83193-rob-gier-zenith-soccer-tours", "title": "Azkals' Gier launches football program in UK", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding"},

I still find it interesting that back then people said they were overwhelmed and moved to tears when he passed by. ,One believer said on social media that it felt like \",nilukuban ka ng Ispirtu Santo, (you were filled with the Holy Spirit),\" as the Argentine pontiff whizzed by in his jeepney-styled popemobile.,But when I think about the many devout Catholics of this country who cling to their faith to make things better, the thousands of typhoon victims surpassing their struggles because they believe in and draw strength from their religious beliefs, suddenly Pope Francis, his presence in Tacloban, and his many stops in Manila become more important for me. ,Apparently, regardless of my personal beliefs, his visit did matter to a lot of people. Their truth is theirs to believe in. ,The oddity of it all,It seemed odd to me when my superiors instructed us to treat our respective assignments for Pope Francis' state and pastoral visit like it was our own beat, i.e. the issues, sectors, and/or institutions we cover on a daily basis.,That meant churning out stories containing usable information to minimize foreseeable harm for the millions who would troop to the venues of his talks and sermons.,It also meant listening as much as I could to people who didn't think the way I did.,These are people whose lives circled around \u2013 and whose actions were driven by \u2013 their Catholic faith.  ,Assigned to cover ,the Pope's encounter with the youth at the University of Santo Tomas,, I talked to ,young Thomasians, about what they thought about ,this rockstar of a Pope,. ,Most of them, saw him as a symbol of hope, of love, of the brand of Catholicism their church should aspire to. ,Their truth is theirs to believe in. (READ: ,The irresponsibility of rabbits,),Global influencer,Influencers like Pope Francis generate a great deal of news. Whether they like it or not, their actions matter.,There is no doubt about Francis' tremendous reach. He has a following of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. His words are given much weight by many, and his appeal transcends religious boundaries. ,With millions heeding his call, each move he makes and word he utters could translate to the world becoming a better or alternatively a worse place. ,While I personally detest the kind of influence Pope Francis wields (seemingly coming from a system that homogenizes people's beliefs), I have no control over those who genuinely choose to believe him and the Catholic Church. ,Again, their truth is theirs to believe in. After all, such beliefs were honed mostly due to structures I and many others were born into.,This, of course, does not mean we let go of our responsibility to question. (READ: ,3 in 5 priests live in a material world,),It just means that we understand that global influence matters in a world where people's actions and daily choices are shaped by the men, women, and institutions that influence them.,Influencers are newsmakers whether they like it or not, and perhaps more importantly, whether I like it or not.,\"Be healthy,\" our editor told us when we were preparing for the papal visit. ,\"Welcome the Pope,\" she said. \"Your belief or non-belief should not get in the way of a good coverage.\" ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/buena-bernal/82375-pope-francis-coverage-non-catholic-reporter", "title": "Their truth is theirs to believe in", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/171463-nadine-lustre-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/video/reports/81246-pope-francis-to-youth-on-loving-and-receiving-love?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=referral&utm_medium=share_bar,http://www.rappler.com/specials/pope-francis-ph/81176-ust-youth-testimony-pope-francis"},

It's hard not to notice the 20-floor towers of SM Wind Residences in Tagaytay City. All photos by Pia Ranada/Rappler  ,TAGAYTAY CITY, Philippines \u2013 Back in the 1990s, Berniemack Arellano and his family would rent a bamboo and nipa cottage for around P100 ($2.3) for a view of Taal Volcano.,The Tagaytay City he remembers was like a ,probinsya, (province) \u2013 cool, relaxing, no traffic, and laid-back.,It was the perfect vacation spot for a grade one student like him from Imus, Cavite, just an hour's drive from Tagaytay. ,\"Another thing that I remember about Tagaytay was the ,bulalo, stores in Mendez Junction. I can still remember Tagaytay with its marigold blooms and wide spaces. We would head on to Palace in the Sky to get a 360-degree view of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, and, on a clear day, the glimmering skyline of Metro Manila,\" Arellano recalls.,- Professor Noel Sedigo, Cavite State University, ,Back then, the top tourist draws in the \"summer capital\" were the Picnic Grove and Taal Vista Lodge, where you could lay your ,banig, (bamboo mat) on the grass and enjoy the breeze.,But today, Arellano and his family no longer frequent Tagaytay.,He says the city \"lost its magic\" after being victimized by \"runaway tourism.\" What was once a haven for urbanites is fast resembling an urban jungle.,\"The most evident change was the rise of high-rise condominiums, buildings, and theme parks in Tagaytay. Although I am for development, this seems to be runaway tourism and lacking urban planning,\" Arellano told Rappler.,A visit to Tagaytay now yields not only a view of majestic Taal Volcano down in Batangas province but of several new high-rise buildings, including the 10 towers of SM Wind Residences, each 20 floors high; the 21-story condominium Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland; and the 9-story Robinson's Summit Ridge Hotel. There are other major commercial projects on the way. ,The Tagaytay City Planning and Development Office told Rappler there are at least two more: The District Tagaytay of AyalaLand Corporation that will open this year and Tagaytay Fora by Filinvest Corporation set to open by 2016. ,'GET AWAY.' The 21-storey Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland is being marketed as the 'perfect refuge' for urbanites ,Tagaytay Fora will be a \"mixed use\" project composed of a 10-story condotel; a commercial block with a Metro Gaisano Supermarket, department store, 4 digital cinemas, and around 300 dining and retail shops; and a forest-like garden that can be used for events. ,The District Tagaytay meanwhile will feature two 14-floor condominium buildings.,Six new condominium buildings were approved last year and will begin construction this year.,It seems development is finally coming to the ,probinsya, of Arellano's memory. But a look at scientific studies commissioned by the Cavite provincial government and a talk with scientists show that Tagaytay's vertical and urban development may spell crisis for the rest of the province.,Know your neighbors,Water is often an overlooked resource, especially for a city rising so near a lake. But water is one of Tagaytay's looming problems.,\"Tagaytay may have water today, but it will be an issue in the long run,\" Professor Noel Sedigo, chairman of Cavite State University's environment studies department, told Rappler. ,Sedigo has been tapped by the province to analyze its water situation. After looking at various studies and making some of his own, he said the picture does not look good.,MORE CONCRETE. Summer homes and concrete getaways continue to be built all over Tagaytay City  ,While Tagaytay has just enough water for its households at the moment, its current trend of vertical development and urbanization is likely to cause a water shortage in the near future.,Water is a problem for the rest of Cavite too. In fact, a 2012 study commissioned by the province shows that the province as a whole is already experiencing water shortage.,The study, conducted by energy and bulk water supply group SUWECO, concluded that the province is already short of water by around ,1,200, million liters/day (MLD). ,This is because total water demand for 2015 was pegged at 1,777 MLD while the total amount of water the province can recover from under the ground and from its springs and rivers is only 618 MLD, according to a summary of the report obtained by Rappler.,How will the province manage in 2040 when it is expected to have a water demand of 2,845 MLD?,If nothing is done, Cavite's supply of groundwater (water stored underground for thousands of years) will run out by 2019, said Sedigo.,The SUWECO study showed that the agriculture-intense towns of General Trias, Tanza, Naic, and Imus drink up most of the water for irrigating crops. This is apart from the industrial, recreational, commercial, and residential usage of water.,Thirsty Tagaytay,The shortage is already being felt. According to a 1991 study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), intense groundwater extraction (the process of pumping groundwater to water pipes) is causing groundwater levels to decrease by one meter annually. ,The province estimates that its groundwater is now 15 to 50 meters below its level in 1990. Thus, to reach the groundwater and be able to deliver it to faucets all over the province, longer and longer pipes have had to be used.,In places as elevated as Tagaytay, 3 pipes, each 25 feet long, are now used instead of just one, adding to the cost of water. Data from the province and Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) showed that water rates have been rising steadily, from P125 ($2.8) in 2000 to P233 ($5.3) in 2012. ,And what about its new high-rise buildings? Sedigo said lower groundwater means contractors will need more powerful water pumps to bring the water all the way to the highest floors. ,NEW TAGAYTAY. The Sky Ranch has become a major tourist attraction ,The TCWD, a government-owned and controlled corporation in charge of water distribution, has felt the burn.,That's why it ,entered into a contract ,with a water company in 2012 to extract water from other parts of Cavite.,In the contract, TCWD admitted the city's \"dire need of additional water resources\" due to increasing urbanization.,\"Water demand is expected to increase tremendously, even as high as double the normal demand, and upon completion and full operation of all the ongoing establishment and hotels currently being built,\" it said in the contract.,But after a petition by Cavite residents who claim the water project will deprive ,them, of water, the Court of Appeals ,ordered the water project stopped, until issues were resolved. ,Cavite's 're-charge station',Tagaytay City plays an important role in this water crisis. Though it may not be the most heavily water-consumptive of Cavite provinces, its path of development determines whether or not Cavite can survive its water woes.,The city makes up the province's upland area, an area that, due to its geographic location and elevation, functions as a re-charge station for Cavite's water supply.,\"The monsoon winds bring rain clouds to Tagaytay. Because of the high elevation, the rainwater is able to flow down slowly, giving it time to infiltrate the ground and gather beneath as groundwater,\" said Sedigo.,Because groundwater comes in trickles, it took thousands of years for the aquifer below Cavite to form and become one of its major sources of water.,VITAL WATER. This is an image of how the hydrological cycle works. Image courtesy of Noel Sedigo  ,With Tagaytay now becoming more concretized, it may take even longer to replenish that aquifer, if at all. The city is developing fast at the cost of trees which help bring rainwater underground.,The more concretized Tagaytay becomes, the less water goes to Cavite's aquifer. ,\"If I had my way, I'd keep Tagaytay forested,\" said Sedigo.,Only around 7% of Cavite is forested. Almost half, 48%, is under concrete, while the rest is agricultural land.,But at the rate Tagaytay is going, Sedigo may be hoping in vain.,Since 2011, the city's number of commercial establishments has increased by an average of 33 establishments a year, said City Planning and Development Officer IV Carlos Zuniga.,Its number of residential units, mostly constructed in existing subdivisions, has been increasing by an average of 205 units a year. The past 4 years alone have seen the rise of 20 new condominiums of various heights (1 story to 11 stories), he added.,More worrisome is Tagaytay's expansion of areas for urbanization. ,In 2009, the city amended its Zoning Ordinance to classify 4 areas as new Primary Urban Core (PUC) zones. These areas are where buildings of up to 20 stories high can be built.,URBANIZATION. The red areas are the new primary urban core zones declared by Tagaytay in 2009. (Note: This map is an edited version of a 1998 map. The map was edited by Tagaytay to reflect the 2009 zoning ordinance.) ,City Ordinance 2009-054 identifies the construction of tall buildings as its strategy for prosperity: ,Today, 3 PUC zones are occupied by the new condominiums and commercial establishments, including the Sky Ranch, a recreational area with rides and restaurants. The 4th PUC zone is yet to be developed. Tagaytay visitors know it well: it's the Picnic Grove.,Define 'sustainable' ,City planning officials defend Tagaytay's path of development.,\"We don't see yet at present that the city's urban growth threatens our environment because we provide our own measures to protect the environment and we strictly enforce the zoning ordinance,\" said Zuniga.,The amended ordinance does control what type of structures can rise in specific parts of Tagaytay. For instance, only one to two-story buildings can be constructed on the Ridge, the highest part of Tagaytay facing the Taal Volcano. ,MEMORIES. A remnant of the old Tagaytay, the Picnic Grove is managed by the city government ,To ease traffic, buildings inside a PUC zone are required to provide their own parking space and set back their building at least 5 meters from the road.,The current administration has also stopped the construction of additional subdivisions on the ridge area of the city, Planning Officer Lambert Manalo told Rappler.,To keep its water supply free from contamination, households are required to have multi-chamber septic tanks. Establishments like malls, stores, and restaurants must have their own sewerage treatment plant.,But only time will tell if these measures are enough to keep Tagaytay's development sustainable. ,Arellano and Sedigo have a different idea of sustainable. ,Arellano said, if he was in charge, he would \"promote proper zoning measures and limited urban vertical development, in order for Tagaytay to sustain its tourism and charm.\",Sedigo suggested a shift to ecotourism and \"backpacker\" tourism to keep most of the city forested. He regrets the trend of building residential units and summer houses that will lead to increased use of the limited water supply.,\"Tagaytay should be kept transient. Tourists come, take photos, and then go home.\" \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/82916-tagaytay-development-water-shortage", "title": "Tagaytay's tall buildings spell a water crisis", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/72473-charice-oprah-coming-out-interview,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61027-tagaytay-cavite-indang-water-supply,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61584-court-water-company-cavite"},
{"author": "Natashya Gutierrez", "date": "2016-02-13T09:58:29.000Z", "content": " WIDELY PRACTICED. Unicef says 200 million women and girls living today have undergone female genital mutilation. JAKARTA Indonesia When Mary was in elementary school a male classmate was circumcised. xa0 xa0He received gifts from friends as a form of congratulations prompting Mary to tell her mother when she got home I should get circumcised Mom. I can get a lot of money. Her mother s response was not what she expected. xa0 You re already circumcised her mother said. I didn t know that. When When you were a newborn. Mary recalls walking away from that conversation thinking everyone got the procedure done females at birth males perhaps when they were a little older.But it wasn t until later that Mary understood the meaning of the conversation she had with her mother.Mary is one of 200 million women worldwide who have undergone female genital mutilation FGM . The number according to a new report from UNICEF is 70 million higher than what was reported in 2014.While the top 10 countries with the highest prevalence of FGM from 2004 2015 is in Africa the data shows that the increase is partly due to population growth and new data collected in Indonesia.Indonesia with its population of 250 million people is one of 3 countries that account for half of all FGM victims in the world along with Egypt and Ethiopia.Cutting the clitorisIt was in junior high school when Mary first realized that female circumcision was not a regular practice.In conversation with her girl friends Mary learned that not everyone had undergone the procedure as a baby even if all of them were Muslim. xa0First she started to argue about how it was an obligation in their religion as she had always thought it was but becoming more curious decided to read more on the matter.She started reading books on sexual and reproductive health studying photos of vaginas. She learned about the clitoris and realized she didn t have one.Soon after she read a book about female circumcision in Arab culture including books by Moroccan feminist Fatima Mernissi which thoroughly addressed and denounced female circumcision. xa0 I read the book and learned that the practice was one of many ways to control women. One way was through circumcision she told Rappler. xa0According to UNICEF FGM includes all procedures that involve altering or injuring the female genitalia for non medical reasons. It is a practice recognized internationally as a violation of human rights of girls and women with February 6 being the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation.Even within Indonesia the practice differs in various regions. xa0Secretary General of the Women s Coalition Dian Kartika Sari said the culture of female circumcision in each region is different. xa0 xa0 There is not just one cut she told Rappler on Friday January 8.In the island of Madura for example the clitoris is cut. In other regions the feeling on the clitoris is killed by slicing off a small part but it is not completely cut off. He also said it is still practiced in some urban areas.In 2010 the Ministry of Health released a regulation that authorized certain medical professionals such as doctors midwives and nurses to perform circumcision on female patients. xa0The technical details of circumcision was even mentioned in the regulations Make a scratch on the skin that covers the front of the clitoris by using the tip of a disposable sterile needle measuring 20G 22G of the mucosa toward the skin without injuring the clitoris said article 4 paragraph 2. xa0The regulation was repealed by the Deputy Minister of Health Ali Ghufron Mukti soon after. xa0Because while FGM is widely practiced in Indonesia many others in the country do denounce FGM as a violation of rights. According to UNICEF FGM violates women s and girls right to health security and physical integrity their right to be free from torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment and their right to life when the procedure results in death. What orgasm For Mary one of the rights taken from her was her sexual rights at 33 Mary has never experienced an orgasm in her life.She was first sexually active in college and is now married. But without a clitoris Mary said she has never experienced an orgasm a feeling her friends describe as much like flying. I can never relate when they talk about it she said. It makes me sad. xa0Mary said the books she read said women find it difficult to enjoy sex without a clitoris admitting that she is unsure if her problem is psychological or physical. xa0Mary said the problem has caused stress for not just herself but for her husband who for 5 years tried various ways to help her orgasm but to no avail. She said she views sex now as just a waste of time describing her sex as mediocre. There are two main reasons parents have their daughters undergo FGM in Indonesia the first is religious as many Muslims here believe that female circumcision is an Islamic requirement or at the very least is highly recommended in Islam. This is despite the fact that no formal links between Islam and FGM exist and that no Islamic laws or Quranic verses speak of FGM let alone make it a requirement.Even Fatayat NU the women s division of Nahdlatul Ulama Indonesia s largest Islamic organization have xa0acknowledged xa0that FGM is not mentioned in the Quran and is simply a cultural product.The second reason FGM is popular in Indonesia is because it is believed to reduce women s sexual desire and libido. xa0This belief is widely held. All parents obviously want their children to live the best lives possible and for most Indonesian parents this includes no sex before marriage. In today s hypersexualized world Indonesian parents would do all they could to ensure their children are safe from the risks of seks bebas xa0or premarital sex. xa0Female genital cutting is believed by some to be one way of achieving this. Without it it is thought girls will become sexually aggressive and will actively pursue undesirable sexual relationships. Never again Previously furious at her parents who asked that doctors circumcise her and her sister upon birth Mary has since accepted her fate and the fact that the effects of FGM is something she will have to live with for the rest of her life.Mary said her parents were apologetic when she first confronted them about it saying she was born in an Islamic hospital where it was common practice. Her parents she told Rappler didn t know better.UNICEF data shows Mary s experience is not that unique. Data shows that parents are the ones who ask for circumcision for their children the most followed by religious leaders relatives and community leaders.Even today many in Indonesia think FGM is still a necessity. Sari said many community leaders still preach FGM which is one reason why the practice still exists in Indonesia. It is also still a widespread myth that FGM has health benefits.However there is no evidence that FGM affects cleanliness or vaginal health. xa0Claims that urine and genital secretions accumulate and fester in the vulva vagina or urethra have no medical backing. FGM does not reduce chances of urinary tract infections or infections of the reproductive system. Instead data shows FGM causes risks to health.Research reveals that FGM is carried out mostly on young girls between infancy and age 15.

They were substantial and constructive Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters of the talks adding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande left swiftly afterward. Work is under way to prepare the text of a possible joint document to implement the Minsk agreements said Peskov referring to a widely flouted truce from September.A French official also called the talks constructive and substantial and said work was being done to pull together a document aimed at implementing the September truce.The three leaders who did not address the media after the meeting are to discuss the effort with Ukrainian President Poroshenko by telephone on Sunday February 8.The European pair s talks with the Kremlin strongman were seen an attempt to prevent the 10 month conflict in east Ukraine from spilling out of control as Washington considers whether to supply weapons to Kiev.The visit was Merkel s first to Moscow since the start of the Ukraine crisis while Hollande had made a brief stopover in December.Ahead of the talks Merkel played down hopes of a rapid end to the fighting that has claimed more than 5 300 lives since April.Merkel and Hollande first flew to Kiev on Thursday February 5 for discussions when US Secretary of State John Kerry also visited the Ukrainian capital.Kerry is set to meet Russia s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov at a security conference in Munich this weekend with the high level diplomacy seeking to resolve the worst East West crisis since the end of the Cold War.

Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe. President Putin continues to call for new peace plans as his troops roll through the Ukrainian countryside and he absolutely ignores every agreement his country has signed in the past Biden said.The West and Kiev accuse the Kremlin of sending troops and sophisticated weapons across the border to bolster separatists in Ukraine. Moscow has insisted it is not a party to the conflict.Observers have warned that if the United States gets involved militarily the regional conflict could reach a dangerous new stage and become a proxy war between Russia and the West.Russia is already under heavy Western sanctions over its alleged actions in Ukraine and European Union officials said Thursday that the bloc would blacklist more Russian individuals.The sanctions already in place along with low oil prices have dealt a blow to Russia s economy but have failed to force Putin to change tack over Ukraine.Ahead of the talks Hollande said a ceasefire should be the first step on the path to a comprehensive settlement. Kerry voiced support for what he called a helpful Franco German plan.

Part 3 looks at Marwan's regional and global ties to terrorism.,The information comes from classified intelligence documents obtained over a decade of research from nearly half a dozen nations and verified by at least two independent sources. ,A US-educated engineer, Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: his brother was arrested in the United States in 2007 while another brother was arrested in Indonesia in 2001. ,Marwan is wanted in Malaysia for the killing of a Christian member of Parliament in 2000, the only successful al-Qaeda linked attack in Malaysia. Marwan was also a leader of Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM, which carried out those attacks. ,A senior leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, once al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia, Marwan fled to the Philippines in 2003, according to the US, to evade a regional crackdown and is one of the last surviving members of his group. One by one, his compatriots were tracked down and neutralized by authorities: Azahari Husin, the expert Malaysian bomb maker who allegedly trained Marwan; Dulmatin, who fled to the Philippines around the same time as Marwan, killed by Indonesian authorities when he returned home; and Umar Patek, who left the Philippines and was captured in Abbottabad, Pakistan (shortly before Osama bin Laden was killed in the same city) before being extradited to prison in Indonesia.,Marwan managed to evade ,the first-ever US smart bomb attack, in the Philippines against him in 2012 in Sulu. That operation did kill his long-time host, Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail Gumbahali, better known as Doc Abu.,He also evaded a second secret special operations attempt in July 2012, after he fled to ,the marshy swamplands in Butig, Lanao del Sur,, near the Moro Islamic Liberation Front\u2019s Camp Bushra.,Another operation had been planned as early as September 2014 \u2013 perhaps the reason why suspended Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Alan Purisima remained on top in the ,January 25 Mamasapano, attack that killed 44 elite cops. Planned under his watch, these operations are extremely sensitive. (Authorities claimed the January 25 operation killed Marwan but they are awaiting confirmation through DNA tests.),Weaknesses,Many are asking why the Armed Forces of the Philippines or AFP wasn\u2019t notified earlier. ,\u201cAnyone who actually has that question fundamentally doesn\u2019t understand the inability of the AFP and the PNP to protect sensitive information,\u201d a former US Special Forces officer told me a day after news of the 44 dead operatives came out.  \u201cIf they notify anybody, that operation is done. It\u2019ll leak out, and Marwan will be gone,\u201d said the American familiar with the territory.,Anyone familiar with special forces operations knows of the often dangerous rivalry between the Philippine military and the police \u2013 a rivalry that has killed those caught in the middle and foiled numerous operations. This is part of the reason these operations are kept on a tight need-to-know basis. ,Multiply that by the organizational rivalries of their US counterparts \u2013 the CIA working with Filipino special forces operatives and the FBI working with law enforcement. Then add conflicting vested interests of local and national Filipino politicians, and you begin to get a sense of the complex brew on the side of the authorities. ,Now add the societal landscape they need to navigate: an area where law and order is weak at best \u2013 full of clan rivalries, private armed groups and overlapping family ties in the middle of a splintering Muslim insurgency, with a significant group pushing for peace and a minority spoiling for war. ,Over the last 20 years, numerous Filipino and US officials have told me there is no choice but peace because the reality is that the Philippine military and police cannot win a war. ,Now you can begin to appreciate how difficult the situation is.,3 women and an in-law,Marwan\u2019s first weapon wasn\u2019t his ideology nor the bombs he made. It was his women: at least 3 Filipino wives who cemented him into the landscape.,Although he never admitted it when he was interrogated by authorities in December 2010, his police interrogators suspected Aljebir Adzhar, alias Embel, was one of Marwan\u2019s brothers-in-law.,Embel's father was a trusted aide of Abu Sayyaf leader Doc Abu: he and his men often stayed at Embel\u2019s family home in Parang, Sulu, where Embel said Doc Abu \u201chad mass support.\u201d Over time, Embel and his brother began helping Doc Abu, first by running errands as young boys then graduating to scouting government troop movements to alert the Abu Sayyaf. This is the extended social network that made it so dangerous for the police and military to enter communities unarmed.,Embel talked about how Doc Abu gave him P70,000 to buy a brand new black Honda motorcycle with yellow stripes. That was what he used to do the weekly shopping for Marwan, who gave him P1,500 a week to buy a sack of rice, coffee and bread at Love Life Bakery in Jolo. Embel said Marwan would give him extra money to buy chicken siopao, which Marwan loved.,Embel was also the conduit for Marwan\u2019s conjugal visits, which began with Embel picking up Marwan\u2019s wife from the Jolo market. Then 17 years old, Jaida is a Yakan from Basilan.  Embel said she normally wore slacks and a shirt with long, black sleeves and carried two suitcases. She also \u201ccovered her face.\u201d ,Embel would bring her to the house of the barangay captain, where he stayed behind. Then she would walk another 30 minutes alone to the house of Embel's family, where Marwan would meet her. She would normally stay with Marwan there for about a month unless a military operation happens, in which case she\u2019d go back to the barangay captain\u2019s house.,His family didn\u2019t just support the Abu Sayyaf. Embel\u2019s sister, Kasma, is married to a member of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 1996. Over the years, though, internal fighting has often spilled out into streets in Zamboanga, most recently in 2013. Embel said his sister and her family lived in the MNLF camp in Indanan, Sulu.,At least two of the men trained by Marwan during this time were from Cotabato and \u201chad a strong alliance with the MILF (the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 2014) in central Mindanao.\u201d,Collusion,Finally, there is collusion between those who hunt and the hunted.  ,In 2009, Embel said he became close to Italian Eugenio Vagni, one of 3 members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf under Albader Parad. Embel told authorities he and his brother helped feed Parad and his men, whom Embel claimed received a ransom of P60 million for the release of their hostages, although ICRC denied it paid ransom.,That ransom, according to Embel, was negotiated and given to the Abu Sayyaf by Parad's relative, then Vice Governor Lady Ann Sahidula, who later ran for \u2013 and won \u2013 a seat in Congress.,Here's where it turns into quicksand: Embel said the kidnapping was masterminded by a jail guard whose father is a regional police intelligence officer. Part of the ransom, Embel said, was given to members of the police.,Now you begin to see how the lines blur, and why there are often many shades of truth in this land.,In part 2, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the February 2012 US smart bomb attack through the eyes of another of Marwan\u2019s brother-in-law, Ren-Ren Dongon, whose family\u2019s interwoven marriages cemented alliances between the Abu Sayyaf, the Rajah Solaiman Movement and Jemaah Islamiyah. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Part 2: ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: Ren-Ren Dongon,Part 3:  ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: From family to global terrorism,Maria A.

If you can cut through Digong\u2019s populist bluster, you will find a number of, actually not policies, more like policy thrusts.    ,Leni Robredo is the perfect antithesis of Duterte\u2019s misogyny, his hatred of women. Where Duterte is a loud braggart, Leni is ,tranquilo, \u2013 a few words, a shy smile and she gets her point across. Her victory is as amazing as Duterte\u2019s. It\u2019s hard to imagine that they both come out of the same pit of resentment and anger where many of our people live their lives day in, day out.,This was more than an election that picked our leaders. It is a warning to all our leaders, winners and losers alike, that things cannot remain as they are. Mar Roxas is the best president we never had. He had the misfortune of being perceived as representing the way things are, more than ,daang matuwid,, the kind of society where the more the economy grows, the more frustrated the poor become.,To be fair, more has been done for the poor under the Aquino administration than at any time under any one regime, even the last 4 of them taken together. The problem is that PNoy\u2019s personality, Mar\u2019s for that matter \u2013 their way of doing things, made it difficult for them to ,reach, the poor even as they accumulated projects and programs for them. They resisted, would not even know the first thing about, ,populism,.,I do not know if Duterte is a conscious populist. His oversized personality, his self-absorption makes him a perfect populist. On one side of his macho personality, his preoccupation with women, on the other, not unrelated, with violence. It is the people\u2019s fear for their personal safety that Digong is responding to. A populist is not accountable. All he has to do is (re)present in his words and actions the people\u2019s fears, anger, and hopes. A President Rodrigo Duterte, however, is accountable.,Unsaon pod lamang,In Siquijor, we say ,unsaon pod lamang,, accept what we cannot reverse, make the best of it. If you can cut through Digong\u2019s populist bluster, you will find a number of, actually not policies, more like policy thrusts. These are not necessarily implementable, but could set things into motion. Take his constant refrain, drug lords and police who protect them, beware. It would be nice if drug lords actually got scared and stopped operating. More likely, small time dealers and their teenage runners will get targeted.,It\u2019s not as if police are new to extrajudicial killings. They cannot be blamed if they believe that the statements of Duterte have given them ,carte blanche, to kill as many drug lords as they can. Outside of police killings, vigilante groups, often out of uniform police, will have even less restrictions. The problem for Duterte is that he does not have the kind of control over the national situation as he had in Davao City.,There are more doable things in police reform. Because police were ill-equipped and poorly paid, the Philippine National Police (PNP) for many became a platform for sharing profits with criminals. But much has already been done in police reform. The PNP is a more professional agency. Its image has moved beyond the potbellied policeman. Digong can consolidate these gains by following through on raising police salaries, and identifying those 3 corrupt police generals he talked about.,INCOMING PRESIDENT. Rodrigo Duterte in 'Malaca\u00f1ang of the South', DPWH Depot Compound, Panacan, Davao City. File photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler ,If the Duterte administration achieves nothing else except conclude a political settlement with the National Democratic Front (NDF), it will have made a major contribution. Duterte\u2019s experience in crafting a \u201cworking arrangement\u201d with the Davao City NPA, and his appointment of NDF nominees to Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions, have created better political conditions for peace talks than in the preceding administrations. All indications are that Joma Sison is anxious to conclude talks that will enable him to return from exile.,Whether Sison can get the local NPA to agree is another matter. If Benny and Wilma Tiamzon, who are not as enthusiastic about peace talks as Sison, are released, will they go along at the pace that Sison wants? A ceasefire should be relatively easy, but what \u201ccantonment\u201d means, will local NPA agree to remain in identified camps, is going to be difficult. The situation in Caraga, where Duterte wants an end to illegal mining, provides an example of difficulties. Can Duterte and Sison persuade the military and the NPA who protect illegal mining to forego their millions in protection money?,I do not understand what considerations underlie Duterte and his people\u2019s seeming hesitation on finalizing political settlement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front by pushing for the passage of the BBL. Waiting for constitutional amendments shifting the government from unitary to federal will take many years, and will not address the historical injustices to the Moro people. It\u2019s also curious that neither Digong nor his people have said much about Mindanao development. Surely it\u2019s not enough to stick a dirty finger at Imperial Manila.,While waiting for constitutional reform, there are many things that the Duterte administration can do to transfer more power and resources to local governments. They can retain Bottom-up Budgeting (BuB) for a start. Cutting it as Cabinet designate Ben Diokno reportedly suggests would risk the opposition of mayors. Poverty can be added to the formula for Internal Revenue Allotments (IRA). The long delayed review of the Local Government Code can be organized even as the more radical federalism proposal is being discussed.,There are many reforms that Digong and his people have supported, from FOI to mining to K+12. His economic team \u2013 Sonny Dominguez, Ernie Pernia and Ben Diokno \u2013 is strong and will likely continue the economic reforms of the PNoy administration. What people worry about is the volatility of Duterte\u2019s rhetoric. It\u2019s not just his cussing, it\u2019s also how Duterte will navigate the demands of his allies on the Left and the Right. We can always hope for the best. In Siquijor, we go from ,unsaon pod lamang, to hope, ,bason pod lamang.,Leni can help. With characteristic generosity, she says Duterte can expect 100% support. It may be best that she will not be in the Cabinet where she will be expected to provide undifferentiated support. From outside the Cabinet, but with the authority of her mandate as number two, she can provide critical collaboration, or if necessary, an alternative. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Joel Rocamora is a political analyst and a seasoned civil society leader who has been working on issues of democracy, governance, and social movements for several decades.

So he really had no choice but to make a play, and he did.\",Smith finished with 21 points off the bench once more to go with 9 rebounds and two assists.,The import's last play does not, however, overshadow ,Pogoy's statement game in his first finals appearance. The rookie buried 5 3-pointers, including one that gave TNT a 10-point cushion halfway through the fourth. He was a huge problem for the Beermen, who came out flat to start the series and failed to find a rhythm amid the KaTropa's pesky defense.,Castro also had his own big moment, coming up with a clutch 3-pointer that put the KaTropa up 102-99 with 44.2 seconds left. Castro was a rebound shy of a triple-double with 14 points, 10 assists, and 9 rebounds., ,Troy Rosario was another finals first-timer who did not balk under the all-new atmosphere and pressure on his way to scoring 10 points and grabbing 6 rebounds, plus plenty of hustle plays.,TNT capitalized on the cold-shooting San Miguel, who shot 6-of-29 from deep, and let its defense dictate the game from the start. They forced the Beermen to 13 first half turnovers and picked up 19 big points off of that, while San Miguel had only 6 points off of TNT's 8 turnovers.,SMB's total turnovers rose to 23 and they gave up 27 points by the end of it.,Charles Rhodes had a highlight 21-point opening quarter but was scoreless for the next two quarters before finishing up with 31 on top of 13 rebounds, and 4 assists. He battled foul trouble and turned the ball over 6 times.,June Mar Fajardo put up 18 points and 13 rebounds, while Alex Cabagnot added 16 points. Chris Ross and Arwind Santos combined for 22 markers as the Beermen's shallow bench came back to haunt them in Game 1.,TNT's deep bench, which is the team's edge against the championship-tested San Miguel, outscored the Beermen's by 46-18. Although Smith accounted for 21 of those.,Game 2 of this series is on Friday, June 23. ,Scores,: ,TNT (104),: Pogoy 27, Smith 21, Castro 14, Garcia 13, Rosario 10, Tautuaa 7, Semerad 5, Williams 5, Rosales 2, Golla 0, Carey 0, Nuyles 0. ,San Miguel (102),: Rhodes 31, Fajardo 18, Cabagnot 16, Ross 11, Santos 11, Lassiter 8, De Ocampo 6, Espinas 1, Tubid 0. ,Quarter scores,: 24-31, 56-51, 75-73, 104-102.,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/173625-josh-smith-rr-pogoy-tnt-seizes-game-1-smb", "title": "Smith hits winner, rookie Pogoy shines as TNT seizes Game 1 vs SMB", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/174317-rumors-pacquiao-decline-greatly-exaggerated,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/174313-nadine-lustre-reacts-fhms-sexiest-woman-2017,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked"},

The Court of Appeals issues a Writ of Kalikasan against a water company accused of building a dam that will deliver water from 4 rivers to Tagaytay City alone to the prejudice of other Cavite local governments. Photo from Drumlanrig from Wikimedia Commons,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Court of Appeals, through a Writ of Kalikasan, has ordered water company PTK2 H2O to stop extracting water from 4 rivers in Cavite. It also instructs the company to stop its construction of a dam and water delivery pipes in Indang town. (READ: ,Tagaytay tourism taking water away from Cavite residents?,),The Writ, issued on June 23, was sent to respondents PTK2 H2O, National Water and Resources Board (NWRB), Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) and Department of Environment and Natural Resources Region (DENR) Region IV.,The Writ, obtained by Rappler, orders them to \"cease and desist, pending resolution of this petition, from extracting water from the Ikloy, Indang, Lambak and Saluysoy rivers, from excavating, cutting trees and/or undertaking related construction works, and from implementing and/or executing any and all acts in furtherance of the alleged contracts and activities.\",The respondents were also ordered  to respond to the Writ within a \"non-extendible\" period of 10 days after receiving the document.,A Writ of Kalikasan is a legal remedy designed to protect a Filipino citizen's right to environmental protection. It may be used by any individual or group as protection from environmental damage that threatens the life, health and property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.,The order, issued by Presiding Justice Andres Reyes and Justices Manuel Barrios and Pedro Corales, was in response to a petition for Writ of Kalikasan with Prayer for Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) by Save the Water in Indang (SWIM), a group of concerned Cavite residents and environmental advocates.,The judges found the petition, submitted on June 18, \"sufficient in form and substance.\",Threatened water supply,SWIM accused PTK2 H2O of beginning a construction project that could threaten the water supply of Cavite province.,Documents showed that the water company had signed a deal with the TCWD to provide 50,000 cubic meters of water a day from the rivers. To fulfill their end of the bargain, PTK2 H2O has begun constructing water extraction facilities like a mini dam and pumping stations.,But scientific papers cited by the petition showed how this amount of water would bleed the rivers dry in a few years time. This could lead to water shortage for the 12 cities and municipalities who depend on the rivers.,The NWRB and DENR Region IV are blamed for greenlighting the project despite such studies and despite the lack of a proper environmental impact assessment.,But NWRB Executive Director Sevillo David Jr told Rappler that an Environmental Compliance Certificate is unnecessary for this type of project. He also gave assurances that the NWRB conducted their own study on Cavite's water supply and concluded that the PTK2 H2O project would not endanger it.,According to TCWD, they sought the services of PTK2 H2O because of the water crisis facing Tagaytay City once the commercial establishments and hotels currently being built are completed in a few years.,Tagaytay City is one of the most popular tourism destinations in Luzon because of its cool climate, proximity to Metro Manila and view of the majestic Taal Volcano. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61584-court-water-company-cavite", "title": "Court to water company: Stop extracting from Cavite rivers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/55101-netizens-reactions-asia-next-top-model-finale,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/pba/161671-live-updates-philippine-cup-san-miguel-tnt-semifinals-game-5,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/business/168878-roberto-lim-dotr-undersecretary-aviation-resigns,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61027-tagaytay-cavite-indang-water-supply"},

But the people behind the movie, including director Sam Taylor-Johnson and writer EL James, have said that they've taken great care to preserve the book's appeal \u2013 and meet fans' expectations. , ,Here are what some of the critics are saying. In general, reviews praised the glossy look and performances from the leads, while commenting on how the movie holds back when it comes to the more explicit scenes.,Sheri Linden, ,The Hollywood Reporter, ,Writing for ,The Hollywood Reporter,, Sheri Linden said that the movie's strength over the book is how the movie isn't hampered by the book's long descriptions, though the review does say that the screenplay does retain many of the book's memorable lines. ,Linden also praises the performances from both leads, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson.,Screengrab from YouTube ,Commenting on the sexually charged scenes, she said: \", The penultimate scene, where Christian punishes Anastasia with a belt \u2014 and thrills to it, as Dornan communicates with exquisite subtlety \u2014 is by far the film\u2019s most extreme.\",Lisa Schwarzbaum, ,Entertainment Weekly,EW ,also praised the stars' performances, particularly Dakota as Ana Steele, while pointing out that the film employs a sort of \"look-but-don't-pant\" tone throughout the film. ,\"...,the movie version appears to be aimed at a younger consumer crowd than -the readers (albeit a crowd qualified for R-rated entertainment). In any event, the result is confounding, leaving both those coming to the ,Fifty Shades, phenomenon for the first time as well as those who have read the book to wonder, for different reasons, Where\u2019s the beef?\",Screengrab from YouTube ,Elizabeth Weitzman, ,New York Daily News,Dakota is getting much acclaim for her role \u2013 she's consistently praised over several critics' reviews. ,\"[Jaime] Dornan, unfortunately, never evolves into anything more than a pretty face. But Johnson is a true find: She's so committed, she makes Ana's every discovery \u2014 in or out of the bedroom \u2014 convincing...,She's smarter and sassier than her literary counterpart, while Christian, thank goodness, is less creepy-stalkerish.\" ,Screengrab from YouTube ,This review also points out one thing which many readers might be happy about: the film does away with Ana's references to her \"inner goddess,\" which delights whenever Christian does something she finds particularly arousing, or whenever her character wants to convey a sudden turn in emotion. ,Justin Chang, ,Variety,Almost across the board, most of the critics remarked that the film gets a chance to do away with some elements that didn't work as well in the book, including its dialogues.,Photo courtesy of Columbia Pictures/United International Pictures , ,\"If the problem with too many literary adaptations is a failure to capture the author\u2019s voice, then that shortcoming turns out to be the single greatest virtue of ,Fifty Shades of Grey...\",\"In that respect, there\u2019s something at once underwhelming and almost heartening about the sleek, professional softcore spectacle of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d which substitutes a genteel visual shorthand for James\u2019 hot-and-heavy descriptions, duly cushioned by the rhythmic thrusts and heaves of Danny Elfman\u2019s score,\" continues the review. , ,Finally, here's a bonus from one celebrity who's seen the film: ,Kim Kardashian-West,, reality TV star, ,Will you be watching?

This poses a new challenge to the peace process.    ,MANILA, Philippines - Classified documents and maps obtained by Rappler show the terrorist targets of ,the first smart bomb attack, in the Philippines early this year are still alive and have now found sanctuary in central Mindanao, in a territory controlled by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). ,This poses a new challenge to the peace process between the government and the MILF. Both sides resumed their talks Tuesday, July 17.,The two most senior Jemaah Islamiyah or JI leaders in the Philippines are Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, who carries a US$5-M reward on his head, and Singaporean Mohammad Abdullah Ali, known as Muawiyah, who has a $500,000 reward for his capture or kill. ,Civilian and military intelligence sources from the Phiippines, Malaysia and the United States confirmed to Rappler that the two escaped the joint Phiippine-US smart bomb operation on Feb 2, 2012, which killed their long-time host, Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail Gumbahali, better known as Doc Abu. ,They are now in Butig, Lanao del Sur, near the MILF's Camp Bushra, seen clearly in satellite maps obtained by Rappler and verified by Philippine and US intelligence sources. ,Despite this, the Philippine military continues to insist that the two were killed in the February attack.,When asked by Rappler about the alleged presence of the two JI leaders in MILF territory, Mohagher Iqbal, head of the MILF panel holding peace talks with the government, said: \"The MILF also received that report... but our AHJAG is validating this on the ground.\",TALKING PEACE. MILF chief peace negotiator Mohaguer Iqbal. File photo,From Sulu to Lanao,According to classified Philippine intelligence reports, Marwan and Muawiyah were sheltered in Sulu for nearly two weeks by an Abu Sayyaf member belonging to the group of Radullan Sahiron, the most senior leader of the Abu Sayyaf today. Sahiron allegedly blamed the two for the death of Doc Abu, Sahiron\u2019s close friend. Their two groups often worked together against the military and in kidnap-for-ransom cases. ,\u201cThese two men were not in the kill zone,\u201d said Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore. \u201cIn the battlefield, such confusions can always take place, but today, the Philippine military is much more capable than what it was.  It\u2019s only a question of time that Muawiyah and Marwan will be either captured or killed.\u201d,The documents say Marwan and Muawiyah fled Patikul, Sulu, as early as February 27 after Sahiron and his cousin, MNLF commander Tahil Sali, pushed them out of the area. They were allegedly picked up by another Abu Sayyaf leader, Isnilon Hapilon, and travelled by boat to an area in Butig, Lanao del Sur, near the MILF\u2019s Camp Bushra.,Intelligence sources in Singapore and the Philippines told Rappler Muawiyah has called family members in Singapore since then. ,Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: one brother was arrested in Indonesia for a failed bomb plot; the other brother was arrested in the United States. Marwan is also wanted in Malaysia for the killing of a Christian member of Parliament in 2000, the only successful al-Qaeda linked attack in Malaysia. Marwan is also a leader of Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM, which carried out those attacks.,Filipino intelligence sources also told Rappler that the two men are travelling with pregnant Filipino women, believed to be their wives.,MILF and peace talks,Their area of refuge now becomes tricky because the MILF is in the middle of peace talks with the Philippine government. Chief government negotiator Marvic Leonen says he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the two sides will reach an agreement this year. ,\u201cIn 2006, the MILF committed actually to assist government and interdict lawless elements, and this is via an Ad Hoc Action Group (AHJAG),\u201d said Leonen in a recent interview on #TalkThursday. \u201cThe government has turned over to the MILF a list of its high-value targets (HVTs), and we hope that the MILF soon enough will keep to their commitments in 2006.\u201d,Both Leonen and Iqbal pointed out that AHJAG has helped resolve incidents of kidnapping, without ransom paid, and is part of the reason open conflict has been minimized this year.,Chief government negotiator Marvic Leonen,The difficulty is that the MILF also gave JI sanctuary from the mid-90's until 2005, when the MILF Central Command threw them out, along with the Abu Sayyaf and the Rajah Solaiman Movement. That was when JI members fled to Sulu.,\u201cIt\u2019s a reality that many of those that are lawless do have relatives within communities where MILF may be influential or dominant, and therefore, it may be natural that in some instances, they would come home and seek succor under their protection,\u201d added Leonen.,Marwan and Muawiyah pose a new challenge to the peace process. \"They are the two most important foreign terrorists currently operating in Southeast Asia,\" said Gunaratna. \"They are the two most important foreign international terrorists operating in the Philippines.\" -, Rappler.com, , , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/8719-jemaah-islamiyah-leaders-in-central-mindanao-classified-documents-amp-maps", "title": "2 JI leaders now in MILF territory - reports", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159568-isis-direct-contact-isnilon-hapilon,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/ph-travel/131325-mt-hamiguitan-unesco-world-heritage-site-philippines-natural-science-museum,http://www.rappler.com/nation/2910-us-smart-bombs-used-in-sulu-attack"},

It is equipped with high resolution, day and night camera and thermal imager. ,In the early morning hours of February 2, a ,Scan Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), showed a joint team of US and Filipino soldiers a live feed of what was happening on the ground inside the camp of a senior Abu Sayyaf leader in Parang, Sulu. ,They watched the thermal image of their \"military asset\" - a double agent - and compared what he was texting them with the images they were watching. The asset texted the location and pattern of movements of the people around him \u2013 information the soldiers verified through the thermal images they saw. When he texted that he was leaving the camp, the soldiers watched his thermal image walk away.,Scan eagles, also known as drones, have been operating in the Philippines for many years now.,Although originally flown from US navy ships and operated by civilian contractors, there are smaller drones operated by US special forces. Don\u2019t mistake these for the Predator drones and Global Hawks carrying hell fire missiles that killed Al-Qaeda and other terrorist targets in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ,In the Philippines, drones are used only for surveillance. ,This was confirmed by ,Philippine President Benigno Aquino III on Tuesday, largely because a drone strike handled by the Americans may violate the Philippine Constitution. US troops, Mr Aquino said, \u201care here as advisers. They are here as trainers. They cannot participate in combat operations.\u201d,Which is exactly what they have been doing. ,The US military arrived in the Philippines in February 2002, dubbed the second front in its \u201cwar against terrorism.\u201d At its peak, US troops reached 1,200, including 660 US special forces.,The military alliance also includes technology transfer.  ,In mid-2010, Washington pledged ,$18.4 million of precision-guided missiles, funded under a US Congressional Act, which allowed its defense department to train and equip foreign military allies.,A classified document from the Philippines is explicit: \"Fiscal year 2010 assistance for the Philippines provides a precision-guided missile capability to assist Philippine Armed Forces' counter-terrorism efforts in southern regions to combat the activities of the Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf Group.\",November arrival,The first smart bombs, PGMs or Precision-Guided Munitions kits, arrived in the Philippines on November 1, 2010. ,According to a technical timeline obtained by Rappler, Philippine Air Force pilots sat down with subject matter experts to lay out a training plan in December. ,Weapons training began the following year, on Jan 24, 2011.,Two months later, aircraft installation & training started, leading to test drops which were scheduled to begin in May of the same year. ,On June 20, 2011, the US delivered at least 22 more PGM kits to the Philippine military. ,During this period, US defense contractor Raytheon, the company which makes the PGMs, visited the Philippines 3 times, according to the documents.,Finally, on Feb 2, 2012, after nearly 8 months of training, the Philippines deployed its first smart bombs. ,Target: JI in Sulu,The targets had long been under surveillance: the 2 most senior Jemaah Islamiyah or JI leaders in the Philippines sheltered by Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail, better known as Doc Abu. ,They are Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, who carried a $5-M reward on his head from the US government, and Singaporean Mohammed Abdullah Ali, known as Muawiyah, who had a $500,000 reward for his capture or death.,\u201cThere was a target that was of high enough value with actionable intelligence and the right conditions that would warrant its use,\u201d said a military source privy to the operations. \u201cThese are expensive devices so they are used for the right targets at the right time.\u201d,There was a long, involved process to get to this point, governed by protocols set by both nations, according to documents obtained by Rappler.,The Philippines and the US followed 2 levels of clearance and parallel approval processes.,First, ground commanders from both nations identify a target. For the Americans, its Joint-Special Operations Task Force-Philippines (JSOTF-P) then coordinates with the US Embassy before getting approval from SOCPAC, the Special Operations Command, Pacific in Hawaii.  ,After SOCPAC approves, it alerts the US Pacific Command (PACOM). Then it goes back to JSOTF-P which then notifies its Philippine counterpart of concurrence for the target.  ,On the Philippine side, the commander of the Joint Task Force Comet (Sulu's military unit) coordinates with the Western Mindanao Command (WESTMINCOM) and when US concurrence happens, WESTMINCOM approves the target and authorizes execution by Filipino troops.,BLAST SITE. Sitio Lanao Bato, Sulu. Picture taken at 12:12pm on February 2, 2012,Between 2 and 3 am on February 2, Philippine Air Force OV-10 Broncos dropped the 227 kg (500 lb) bombs in the strike zone in a remote village in Parang, Sulu, demolishing much of the area. ,In the dark,The first signal that new technology was used was the choice of when to drop the bombs.,In the past, planes could only drop their payload during daylight because pilots used visual cues.  ,Now the smart bombs can strike in the dark because they are guided by GPS or a homing device.,About 45 minutes after the bombing, the military asset texted his handlers that he would check \u201cthe targets.\u201d  ,Sources said they watched a thermal image move back to the area. His text said that Doc Abu had been \u201cobliterated.\u201d  Marwan was allegedly \u201ccut in half from the waist,\u201d while Muawiyah was barely breathing with blood gushing out of a deep neck wound.,Based on that, the Philippine military ,announced, the deaths of these key leaders.,Wrong info,But it now appears that the asset was wrong about Marwan and Muawiyah. ,Civilian and military intelligence reports from at least 3 countries show, both JI leaders are still alive,. ,Last week, Malaysia's chief counterterrorism official Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said Marwan was still alive. ,Philippine military spokesman Col Arnulfo Marcelo Burgos maintained his position the JI leaders are dead and said Malaysia should provide \"conclusive proof of life.\" ,On the use of smart bombs, there are conflicting responses from the Philippines. ,Col. Burgos, based in Manila, said the military, \"neither confirms nor denies the existence of such munitions citing operational security reasons. However, its pilots have been training vigorously to further improve their proficiency particularly in the precise delivery of munitions to its identified target.\",Col Jose Cenabre, the head of Sulu's Task Force Comet, categorically denied the use of smart bombs: \"I strongly deny that. That's just talk. We did not use them.\",However, Lt Col Miguel Ernesto Okol, spokesman of the Philippine Air Force, told Rappler: \u201cOur pilots\u2019 accuracy in the past was not good. They were not adept, but now with considerable time training and through the advice of our allies, particularly the US military, we are able to increase the accuracy of our pilots to 80 to 90%.\u201d - ,with reports from David Santos/Rappler.com, ,Maria Ressa, ,is the author of ,Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of Al-Qaeda's Newest Center of Operations in Southeast Asia ,(Free Press, 2003).
