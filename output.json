{"content": "\nThe Order: 1886 is set in an alternate history London while Bloodborne takes you the city of Yharnam, whose citizens turn into beasts    ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Sony on Wednesday, February 4, ,announced the launch of two new PS4 exclusive titles - ,The Order: 1886, and ,Bloodborne,.,Rappler had a chance to take both games for a spin during an exclusive media event held at Imperium e-Sports bar and Video Game Lounge.,The Order: 1886,The Order: 1886 is a third-person shooting game developed by Ready At Dawn Studios (Okami, God Of War: Chains of Olympus, God Of War: Ghost Of Sparta) with the collaboration of Sony Santa Monica (God Of War 1,2,3 and Fat Princess).,Set in an alternate 1886 London, The Order: 1886 tells the story of Grayson, a member of an ancient order of knights tasked with the protection of the world against forces that would do it harm. The player takes control of Grayson a.k.a Sir Galahad as he does The Order's will and completes his missions with either stealth or brute force.,The game's visuals are impressive. At first glance, it is hard to tell whether you are looking at a high budget animated movie or a video game. The texture and lighting are amazing and effective that we often find ourselves immersed at the game's environment and atmosphere. The Order: 1886 redefines the concept of story delivery in video games.,The transition between cinematic storytelling and actual gameplay is seamless and players will find it natural to move Grayson into action while a story event is being played out. This really helps in immersing players into the story. The game runs at 30 frames per second, ideal for achieving a cinematic feel.,The game's third-person-shooter mechanics are standard and easy to get into. The Order: 1886 favors shoot and cover gameplay similar to The Last Of Us and Uncharted.,There are other mechanics thrown in such as bullet time and quick time events. While in cover, you can initiate an attack in slow motion for better control and accuracy. This slow motion attack or bullet time event is breath taking to look at as Grayson switches stance after stance as he guns down each enemy that he sets his sights on.,There are also cinematic quick time events that require the player to press a series of buttons in succession as they are displayed while an event is unfolding in order for Grayson to successfully perform his maneuvers. In some missions, Grayson is required to move stealthily and employ his knife and hand to hand combat expertise for stealth kills.,The game unfortunately does not have a cooperative or multiplayer feature. The lack of this feature is rare for modern shooting games.,It would have been fun to play against other players using the game's armory of steampunk style guns.,The Order: 1886 is set to come out on February 20, 2015., ,Bloodborne,Along with The Order: 1886, we also got to play Bloodborne.,Bloodborne is a third-person action RPG developed by the acclaimed Japanese game developer FROM Software (Armored Core Series, Demons' Souls, Dark Souls 1 and 2). The game was made exclusively for the PS4.,The game takes place on Yharnam, a ruined city cursed with a plague that turns its citizens into monsters. The player takes on the role of the Hunter, a lone adventurer who seeks the rumored medical remedy within the city.,The city of Yharnam is breathtaking. Its design is inspired by victorian architecture and the atmosphere is dark and gothic. The houses and streets lie in a state of ruined beauty, giving these places an eerie and abandoned look. Houses have broken floorboards, cobwebs, tattered piles of books and papers, frayed tapestries, and shattered mirrors. The rooms give off a feeling of history and loneliness, as if decades had passed without any living soul setting foot in their halls. The streets are littered with piles of bricks, broken barrels, abandoned coaches, and rotting corpses.,The environment somewhat evokes scenes from Lovecraftian lore, as if HP Lovecraft himself helped in the level design. The graphics are beautiful and effective in immersing the player in the atmosphere. It's definitely a huge step forward from FROM Software's previous game, Dark Souls II.,We encountered several enemies in the game such as infected city folk and rabid monster dogs. Enemy movement is convincing and unpredictable. Encounters tend to become dangerous when you fight mobs of enemies, often resulting in the death of the player character.,This intense difficulty appears to be the selling point of the game as it rewards players who learn from their mistakes and take the time to learn the game's combat system.,Throwing pebbles at enemies to lure them one by one was a strategy we came up with after suffering several defeats.,The Hunter can equip two weapons, one in each hand. In our case, the character we used had an axe for the right hand weapon and an old firearm on the left. The firearm resembled an old flintlock pistol, just like the ones you would see on pirate movies.,Combat is challenging since it requires you to read your opponent's moves and strike when they are vulnerable. There are no shields in this game so you will need to dodge and roll to evade enemy attacks. This kind of mechanic teaches the player to be careful and avoid being over zealous when attacking.,DEMO. Sony's Arata Naito (L) talks with Rappler's Michan Lorenzo (R) as she tries out the two new games. ,We asked Naito Arata, Sony Asia Region Marketing Manager, a few questions about Bloodborne during the demo:,Rappler:, Is this game related to the Dark Souls series?,Arata:, Well it's being created by the famed company, FROM Software, but we see this game as some sort of spiritual successor to PS3's Demons' Souls.,Rappler:, Is this going to have the same brand of difficulty as the other FROM software game like Demons' Souls and Dark Souls?,Arata:, It's difficult but we don't want to describe it as a difficult game. Again, it's a challenging game but by observing the environment and the enemies you can always find out how to survive. I'm not a super gamer and my reflexes is not super good but I can survive and beat the enemies because I can understand how enemies will move.,Overall, Bloodborne promises to be a rewarding game to beat. It is set to be initially released on March 24, 2015. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/83149-the-order-1886-bloodborne-ps4-impressions", "title": "First impressions: The Order: 1886 and Bloodborne", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/170313-san-antonio-spurs-go-down-fight,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation"},

Dovann Arrabis said his family inspired him to study hard and make the top 10 list of the civil engineering licensure exams. Photo by Dale Israel    ,CEBU CITY, Philippines \u2013 It was the crucial last semester of his 5-year civil engineering course when Super Typhoon Yolanda left his family homeless.,Dovann Arrabis was studying in Cebu City at the time 120 kilometers away from his hometown of Daanbantayan where his family was still living at the time. It was difficult for him to be far from his family, knowing that the eye of the typhoon was nearing his town.  ,But his hard work and perseverance prevailed in spite of the devastation Yolanda caused him and his family., ,Arrabis placed 10th among all board passers nationwide who took the May 2014 Civil Engineering Licensure Examination and was one of the two students from Cebu Technological University (CTU) who made it to the top 10.,Early afternoon on February 6, the new civil engineer was among those recognized at the capitol for being a successful scholar of the Cebu provincial government. For more than 10 years, the capitol has been providing financial assistance and scholarships for the province's top high school students who want to pursue higher education.,Arrabis, who was receiving a monthly allowance of only P2,000 ($45), recalled how difficult it was to study while his family was living in tents at home.   ,\u201cPagka ugma adtong Yolanda, niuli dayun ko sa amoa kay nabalaka kaayo ko sa akong pamilya, (A day after Yolanda struck, I went home worried to check on my family),\u201d said Arrabis, who \u2013 at the time \u2013 was working on finishing his college degree in the evening, while studying for his licensure exam in the morning.,Overcoming odds, ,The eye of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) was near Daanbantayan when it made landfall in northern Cebu in November 2013. The town lost communication and many of its roads became impassable. Hundreds of families lost their homes because of the record-breaking strong winds.,Arrabis said that because of the typhoon, he stopped going to school and stopped reviewing for about two months to help his family recover.,\u201c,Naguol kaayo ko ato niuli, after duha ka buwan naka-recover rapud ko,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I was shocked when I went home. After two months, I was able to recover.) He explained that the will to improve his family's living conditions inspired him to stay focused. ,When he returned to school, Arrabis did not waste time and hit the books immediately. \u201c,Mao to nga sige lang gyud ko ug tuon, tig kadlawn na ko makatulog, kung daot ko ron, mas daot pa ko sauna,,\u201d said Arrabis. (I would study until dawn and was even skinnier before.) ,\u201c,Syempre ang pamilya gyud akong inspirasyon ,(Of course, my family is my inspiration),\u201d said Arrabis, whose father is a carpenter and fisherman. His mother stays at home to look after his other siblings, the youngest of whom is 10 years old. ,Inspiration,Arrabis remembered the first time he got to the city as he entered the CTU-main campus. He saw tarpaulins of achievers and topnotchers being displayed at the gates and around the school.,\u201c,Nakapangutana ko ug kung ako naa diha pud unya, unsa kahay feeling,?\u201d (If my face appears on that tarpaulin, how would that feel like?) That was the question, he said, that guided him all throughout college.,After passing the licensure and making it to the Top 10, he said he was so happy and proud when he walked around the campus with everybody smiling and knowing him. More than that, he said his parents were proud of him.,Magna cum laude,Now working with the Department of Social Welfare and Development regional office for infrastructure projects, Arrabis is earning a basic pay of P29,000 ($654) a month since October, his first job offer. ,He now uses his earnings to continue to support his family. He also graduated magna cum laude at the CTU.,At the capitol, Arrabis got a medal, a plaque and cash incentives totaling about P50,000 ($1,127.89) in a ceremony attended by Governor Hilario Davide III and Vice Governor Agnes Magpale., ,Each college scholar of the capitol, chosen among the marginalized families in the towns, got cash incentives between P5,000-P50,000 ($112-$1,127.89) for finishing school.

{"content": "\nThere is only one way a perceived good leader can succeed in a bad system, situation, or institution: he must reform it first, if not transform it    ,Recalling a few years back the botched Luneta hostage rescue, we remember it precipitated angry calls demanding that President Aquino quit office for failing to avert the crisis that cost the lives of several Hong Kong tourists. ,That unfortunate event would later strain for a time the relations between Hong Kong and Manila. But going further back Luneta, calls for the President\u2018s resignation were already regular column fodders. In fact, even before Aquino could clock in a hundred days in office, some quarters had already demanded his resignation.,But why such a national \"penchant\"?,Many argue that our president exercises more powers, or that he is more powerful, than US president Barack Obama, as the former virtually controls the entire bureaucracy and has a vast influence that extends to Congress and the Supreme Court.,In comparison, we know how Obama was power-checked, others say check-mated, by the Republican-dominated and largely uncooperative Lower House, when majority of its members refused to fund the federal budget which resulted in a government shutdown in late 2013. The US Lower House, in effect, not only held hostage federal funding but more glaringly handed Obama an in-your-face \u201cwe are as powerful as you are, dude\u201d statement.,To better appreciate the vast powers and influence of our president, we refer to the impeachment of former chief justice Renato Corona as its almost perfect manifestation. I say almost, because public outrage, the political interests of senator-judges (vis-\u00e0-vis the upcoming midterm elections at that time), and Corona\u2019s own undoing via his \"unguarded\" testimony, among others, were in play.,The not-so-secret presidential push and inspiration, aside from \"clear instructions\" to allies in both houses of Congress, added up to the pressure for expedited proceedings.,Yet the vast powers of the president are held together by a delicate mantle of public trust, the maintenance or erosion of which can be as fickle as the weather gets, if we go by the latest round of trust survey ratings.,Regardless of the changing public mood, however, one thing remains constant: that the power enjoyed by the incumbent is contingent on the trust the public continually bestows on the office and its occupant, but really more so on the latter. This is, at least, in theory. And this is where the problem lies.,RESIGN. Filipino students hold placards calling for the resignation of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III after he delivers his second televised address on February 6, 2015.  ,We reckon that the election of Benigno Aquino III in 2010, while phenomenal on so many levels, has not much to do with his vision for the Philippines or how his program of action could register growth beyond his term. Rather, it has more to do with sentiments of people betrayed and shortchanged by his predecessor \u2013 a people desperate in their search for a leader who personified the complete opposite of the one they were about to replace.,In sum, the people placed their trust on the one man they believe would, could, and should cure the inherited ills from the Arroyo administration. This is hardly surprising at all under our patronage-driven and personality-based politics. Thus began the reign of Aquino as superman and president.,We cannot avoid discussing presidential resignation by not examining the failures of our political institutions, as well as open the conversation on the numerous attempts by various sectors to strengthen them. The institutional failures provide perfect havens to patronage and corruption, and until we do something fundamentally difficult to destroy these lairs, we will spend the rest of our productive lives digging deeper holes than plugging the leak, so to speak.,But to say that we preserve the status quo in the absence of a leader who is of the same mold as President Aquino is utterly irresponsible, if not downright stupid, and tantamount to insulting the millions, okay the thousands, among us who are better qualified to run the affairs of State.,Our aversion and resistance to presidential resignation is not without basis. For one, our unsteady political institutions still remain prone to subjugation by power wielders who come and go every 6 years or so, and whose combined tenures, so far, have only served to undermine rather than strengthen these supposedly impersonal democratic and therefore accessible institutions.,Understandably, there are many among us whose aversion is influenced by the character of the beneficial successor. (Being an institutionalist, this is the least of my fears.) What feeds more aversion is the uncertainty of the readiness of our institutions \u2013 unsteady many of them are \u2013 to once again be subjected to another round of changes before they could find traction as they undergo rehabilitation after a long period of \"maltreatment\" by previous administrations.,To be fair to the second Aquino administration, efforts were undertaken to flesh out results of its strategy, ,Daang Matuwid,. It may be devoid of vision, but ,Daang Matuwid, rallies people around one common cause and that is reforming public institutions. Whether these efforts have degraded patronage and minimized corruption is a different story altogether.,When Pope Francis came to visit the Philippines, Facebook was flooded with posters bearing the \u201cPope Francis for President\u201d slogan, maybe simply for being such an inspiring and unifying figure to a divided people.,Well, I have a bad news for them: even if Pope Francis succeeded President Aquino by some anomaly, chances are he will also fail just the same under our system as it stands, right as you read this. There is only one way a perceived good leader can succeed in a bad system, situation, or institution: he must reform it first, if not transform it.,So while no one holds the exclusive franchise to good governance, is there someone who can or would guarantee its continuity? That was a trap question actually.,Let me rephrase that by asking rather objectively, impersonally: Can our institutions afford to absorb, adjust, and manage (with relative ease?) the constant shifting of directions and priorities from one administration to the next in such a short period without losing focus on the core deliverables?,I hope each of us can muster our own answers and find our priorities of engagement. I have found mine in the last five words in the preceding paragraph that I believe can last me well beyond 2016. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Tony D.

{"content": "\nThe city's urban development hastens a projected water shortage for the province of Cavite by 2019, according to studies    ,NEW LANDMARKS. It's hard not to notice the 20-floor towers of SM Wind Residences in Tagaytay City. All photos by Pia Ranada/Rappler  ,TAGAYTAY CITY, Philippines \u2013 Back in the 1990s, Berniemack Arellano and his family would rent a bamboo and nipa cottage for around P100 ($2.3) for a view of Taal Volcano.,The Tagaytay City he remembers was like a ,probinsya, (province) \u2013 cool, relaxing, no traffic, and laid-back.,It was the perfect vacation spot for a grade one student like him from Imus, Cavite, just an hour's drive from Tagaytay. ,\"Another thing that I remember about Tagaytay was the ,bulalo, stores in Mendez Junction. I can still remember Tagaytay with its marigold blooms and wide spaces. We would head on to Palace in the Sky to get a 360-degree view of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, and, on a clear day, the glimmering skyline of Metro Manila,\" Arellano recalls.,- Professor Noel Sedigo, Cavite State University, ,Back then, the top tourist draws in the \"summer capital\" were the Picnic Grove and Taal Vista Lodge, where you could lay your ,banig, (bamboo mat) on the grass and enjoy the breeze.,But today, Arellano and his family no longer frequent Tagaytay.,He says the city \"lost its magic\" after being victimized by \"runaway tourism.\" What was once a haven for urbanites is fast resembling an urban jungle.,\"The most evident change was the rise of high-rise condominiums, buildings, and theme parks in Tagaytay. Although I am for development, this seems to be runaway tourism and lacking urban planning,\" Arellano told Rappler.,A visit to Tagaytay now yields not only a view of majestic Taal Volcano down in Batangas province but of several new high-rise buildings, including the 10 towers of SM Wind Residences, each 20 floors high; the 21-story condominium Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland; and the 9-story Robinson's Summit Ridge Hotel. There are other major commercial projects on the way. ,The Tagaytay City Planning and Development Office told Rappler there are at least two more: The District Tagaytay of AyalaLand Corporation that will open this year and Tagaytay Fora by Filinvest Corporation set to open by 2016. ,'GET AWAY.' The 21-storey Tagaytay Prime Residences by Cityland is being marketed as the 'perfect refuge' for urbanites ,Tagaytay Fora will be a \"mixed use\" project composed of a 10-story condotel; a commercial block with a Metro Gaisano Supermarket, department store, 4 digital cinemas, and around 300 dining and retail shops; and a forest-like garden that can be used for events. ,The District Tagaytay meanwhile will feature two 14-floor condominium buildings.,Six new condominium buildings were approved last year and will begin construction this year.,It seems development is finally coming to the ,probinsya, of Arellano's memory. But a look at scientific studies commissioned by the Cavite provincial government and a talk with scientists show that Tagaytay's vertical and urban development may spell crisis for the rest of the province.,Know your neighbors,Water is often an overlooked resource, especially for a city rising so near a lake. But water is one of Tagaytay's looming problems.,\"Tagaytay may have water today, but it will be an issue in the long run,\" Professor Noel Sedigo, chairman of Cavite State University's environment studies department, told Rappler. ,Sedigo has been tapped by the province to analyze its water situation. After looking at various studies and making some of his own, he said the picture does not look good.,MORE CONCRETE. Summer homes and concrete getaways continue to be built all over Tagaytay City  ,While Tagaytay has just enough water for its households at the moment, its current trend of vertical development and urbanization is likely to cause a water shortage in the near future.,Water is a problem for the rest of Cavite too. In fact, a 2012 study commissioned by the province shows that the province as a whole is already experiencing water shortage.,The study, conducted by energy and bulk water supply group SUWECO, concluded that the province is already short of water by around ,1,200, million liters/day (MLD). ,This is because total water demand for 2015 was pegged at 1,777 MLD while the total amount of water the province can recover from under the ground and from its springs and rivers is only 618 MLD, according to a summary of the report obtained by Rappler.,How will the province manage in 2040 when it is expected to have a water demand of 2,845 MLD?,If nothing is done, Cavite's supply of groundwater (water stored underground for thousands of years) will run out by 2019, said Sedigo.,The SUWECO study showed that the agriculture-intense towns of General Trias, Tanza, Naic, and Imus drink up most of the water for irrigating crops. This is apart from the industrial, recreational, commercial, and residential usage of water.,Thirsty Tagaytay,The shortage is already being felt. According to a 1991 study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), intense groundwater extraction (the process of pumping groundwater to water pipes) is causing groundwater levels to decrease by one meter annually. ,The province estimates that its groundwater is now 15 to 50 meters below its level in 1990. Thus, to reach the groundwater and be able to deliver it to faucets all over the province, longer and longer pipes have had to be used.,In places as elevated as Tagaytay, 3 pipes, each 25 feet long, are now used instead of just one, adding to the cost of water. Data from the province and Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) showed that water rates have been rising steadily, from P125 ($2.8) in 2000 to P233 ($5.3) in 2012. ,And what about its new high-rise buildings? Sedigo said lower groundwater means contractors will need more powerful water pumps to bring the water all the way to the highest floors. ,NEW TAGAYTAY. The Sky Ranch has become a major tourist attraction ,The TCWD, a government-owned and controlled corporation in charge of water distribution, has felt the burn.,That's why it ,entered into a contract ,with a water company in 2012 to extract water from other parts of Cavite.,In the contract, TCWD admitted the city's \"dire need of additional water resources\" due to increasing urbanization.,\"Water demand is expected to increase tremendously, even as high as double the normal demand, and upon completion and full operation of all the ongoing establishment and hotels currently being built,\" it said in the contract.,But after a petition by Cavite residents who claim the water project will deprive ,them, of water, the Court of Appeals ,ordered the water project stopped, until issues were resolved. ,Cavite's 're-charge station',Tagaytay City plays an important role in this water crisis. Though it may not be the most heavily water-consumptive of Cavite provinces, its path of development determines whether or not Cavite can survive its water woes.,The city makes up the province's upland area, an area that, due to its geographic location and elevation, functions as a re-charge station for Cavite's water supply.,\"The monsoon winds bring rain clouds to Tagaytay. Because of the high elevation, the rainwater is able to flow down slowly, giving it time to infiltrate the ground and gather beneath as groundwater,\" said Sedigo.,Because groundwater comes in trickles, it took thousands of years for the aquifer below Cavite to form and become one of its major sources of water.,VITAL WATER. This is an image of how the hydrological cycle works. Image courtesy of Noel Sedigo  ,With Tagaytay now becoming more concretized, it may take even longer to replenish that aquifer, if at all. The city is developing fast at the cost of trees which help bring rainwater underground.,The more concretized Tagaytay becomes, the less water goes to Cavite's aquifer. ,\"If I had my way, I'd keep Tagaytay forested,\" said Sedigo.,Only around 7% of Cavite is forested. Almost half, 48%, is under concrete, while the rest is agricultural land.,But at the rate Tagaytay is going, Sedigo may be hoping in vain.,Since 2011, the city's number of commercial establishments has increased by an average of 33 establishments a year, said City Planning and Development Officer IV Carlos Zuniga.,Its number of residential units, mostly constructed in existing subdivisions, has been increasing by an average of 205 units a year. The past 4 years alone have seen the rise of 20 new condominiums of various heights (1 story to 11 stories), he added.,More worrisome is Tagaytay's expansion of areas for urbanization. ,In 2009, the city amended its Zoning Ordinance to classify 4 areas as new Primary Urban Core (PUC) zones. These areas are where buildings of up to 20 stories high can be built.,URBANIZATION. The red areas are the new primary urban core zones declared by Tagaytay in 2009. (Note: This map is an edited version of a 1998 map. The map was edited by Tagaytay to reflect the 2009 zoning ordinance.) ,City Ordinance 2009-054 identifies the construction of tall buildings as its strategy for prosperity: ,Today, 3 PUC zones are occupied by the new condominiums and commercial establishments, including the Sky Ranch, a recreational area with rides and restaurants. The 4th PUC zone is yet to be developed. Tagaytay visitors know it well: it's the Picnic Grove.,Define 'sustainable' ,City planning officials defend Tagaytay's path of development.,\"We don't see yet at present that the city's urban growth threatens our environment because we provide our own measures to protect the environment and we strictly enforce the zoning ordinance,\" said Zuniga.,The amended ordinance does control what type of structures can rise in specific parts of Tagaytay. For instance, only one to two-story buildings can be constructed on the Ridge, the highest part of Tagaytay facing the Taal Volcano. ,MEMORIES. A remnant of the old Tagaytay, the Picnic Grove is managed by the city government ,To ease traffic, buildings inside a PUC zone are required to provide their own parking space and set back their building at least 5 meters from the road.,The current administration has also stopped the construction of additional subdivisions on the ridge area of the city, Planning Officer Lambert Manalo told Rappler.,To keep its water supply free from contamination, households are required to have multi-chamber septic tanks.

That is why I started up Zenith Soccer Tours, to give young kids an experience they will never forget.\u201d,Gier\u2019s program will be running football camps that will give participants a chance to stay at the world-class Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre where high caliber coaches from professional clubs in the UK will coach them.,Zenith Soccer will also take them to a tour of the different football stadiums in London to watch how top English clubs train and play., ,The culminating activity of the whole expedition will be a four-team mini tournament, one team of which will be from a professional football academy,According to the Azkals skipper, he believes the activities his program will provide will not just assist aspiring football players in improving their game but also help them become better individuals.,\u201cI want to give these youngsters some memories they will never forget.  I am a firm believer that experiences like our camp and exposure to different environments and cultures at a young age will help develop and shape these children to become more well-rounded individuals, helping to give them confidence to really express who they want to be.\u201d,The 34-year old Philippine international explained although he is still not keen on retiring, he established Zenith Soccer as a way of planning ahead for his life after football.,\u201cI am not ready to hang my boots up just yet but I am getting to the stage in my career where I need to think about life after playing.  I firmly believe in this program and it is not only a way of me staying connected with football but also a way for me to help develop the grassroots potential that our Filipino based kids have.  ,\u201cThey [kids] will ultimately be the generation on which the success of football in the Philippines depends, and if I can help in some way to make sure that football continues to grow then I will be happy.\u201d,Gier noted he is currently in contact with football academies in the Philippines with the hopes of having future partnerships with Filipino clubs to help boost the local grassroots program. ,To find out more about ,Zenith Soccer Tours, you may log onto their webite at ,www.zenith-soccertours.co.uk, or email Rob Gier at ,info@zenith-soccertours.co.uk,. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/football/83193-rob-gier-zenith-soccer-tours", "title": "Azkals' Gier launches football program in UK", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/business/168878-roberto-lim-dotr-undersecretary-aviation-resigns,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/68370-star-magic-ball-2014-best-dressed-gowns-red-carpet"},

I still find it interesting that back then people said they were overwhelmed and moved to tears when he passed by. ,One believer said on social media that it felt like \",nilukuban ka ng Ispirtu Santo, (you were filled with the Holy Spirit),\" as the Argentine pontiff whizzed by in his jeepney-styled popemobile.,But when I think about the many devout Catholics of this country who cling to their faith to make things better, the thousands of typhoon victims surpassing their struggles because they believe in and draw strength from their religious beliefs, suddenly Pope Francis, his presence in Tacloban, and his many stops in Manila become more important for me. ,Apparently, regardless of my personal beliefs, his visit did matter to a lot of people. Their truth is theirs to believe in. ,The oddity of it all,It seemed odd to me when my superiors instructed us to treat our respective assignments for Pope Francis' state and pastoral visit like it was our own beat, i.e. the issues, sectors, and/or institutions we cover on a daily basis.,That meant churning out stories containing usable information to minimize foreseeable harm for the millions who would troop to the venues of his talks and sermons.,It also meant listening as much as I could to people who didn't think the way I did.,These are people whose lives circled around \u2013 and whose actions were driven by \u2013 their Catholic faith.  ,Assigned to cover ,the Pope's encounter with the youth at the University of Santo Tomas,, I talked to ,young Thomasians, about what they thought about ,this rockstar of a Pope,. ,Most of them, saw him as a symbol of hope, of love, of the brand of Catholicism their church should aspire to. ,Their truth is theirs to believe in. (READ: ,The irresponsibility of rabbits,),Global influencer,Influencers like Pope Francis generate a great deal of news. Whether they like it or not, their actions matter.,There is no doubt about Francis' tremendous reach. He has a following of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. His words are given much weight by many, and his appeal transcends religious boundaries. ,With millions heeding his call, each move he makes and word he utters could translate to the world becoming a better or alternatively a worse place. ,While I personally detest the kind of influence Pope Francis wields (seemingly coming from a system that homogenizes people's beliefs), I have no control over those who genuinely choose to believe him and the Catholic Church. ,Again, their truth is theirs to believe in. After all, such beliefs were honed mostly due to structures I and many others were born into.,This, of course, does not mean we let go of our responsibility to question.

{"content": " NEW YORK USA One of America s most prominent TV anchors Brian Williams faced calls for his resignation Friday February 6 for embellishing an Iraq war story from 2003.Brian Williams. Photo by Justin Stephens NBC Universal Inc Williams 55 who reportedly earns 10 million a year and is watched by an estimated nine million Americans a night admitted that a story he often repeated on air about coming under fire was not true. I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago Williams said in an apology broadcast live Wednesday February 4 on the NBC Nightly News program he hosts each evening. I want to apologize. I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire. I was instead in a following aircraft. He apologized to colleagues again on Friday morning according to a leaked memo purportedly from NBC News president Deborah Turness.The memo said NBC has appointed a team to investigate the facts and help us make sense of all that has transpired. On Facebook Williams said that he had conflated the two events which happened while he was covering the US invasion of Iraq.A hugely respected journalist in the United States he has anchored NBC Nightly News since 2004.Williams is a former chief White House correspondent was celebrated for his coverage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and has collected more than two dozen industry awards.The embellished tale dates back at least to an interview with US chat show king David Letterman in 2013.At the time of the incident in 2003 Williams said it was the Chinook ahead that was almost blown out of the sky. He repeated the story on television as recently as last Friday in an elaborate tribute to a retired soldier who helped provide ground security for the grounded aircraft and crew.But crew members of the Chinook helicopter and Williams s aircraft told Stars and Stripes a US publication that covers the armed forces that the anchor had been nowhere near the helicopter that was fired upon or other Chinooks in its formation.He instead arrived later in a separate helicopter which landed due to an oncoming sandstorm.Credibility under fireBut instead of calming the controversy Williams s on air apology appears to have inflamed critics speaking on rival TV channels who refuse to accept it was an honest mistake.He also faces further scrutiny for his coverage of Katrina in particular an account of seeing a body float face down in the French Quarter the historic district of New Orleans.On Friday the Iraq story was splashed across the front pages of The New York Times New York Post and USA Today the latter with the headline Brian Williams loses credibility with mistake. Hard to see how anchor will survive as face of NBC News USA Today sniffed on the front page.On NBC s rival channel Fox News media commentator Howard Kurtz said The admission raises serious questions about his credibility in a business that values that quality above all else. CNN television journalist Chris Cuomo stressed that memory is either right or it is wrong and we are in the business of being right. He predicted that the Internet would eat him alive. Williams was a near constant fixture on TV as America s world turned upside down in the wake of the 9 11 attacks. He reported frequently from Iraq during the invasion.Besides Katrina he covered the devastating tsunami in Asia in 2004 and last year got the scoop with the first US television interview with whistleblower Edward Snowden in Russia.In December he renewed his contract with NBC for five years. But critics have now rounded on his on air apology also posted on his Facebook page. I m a C 130 pilot who had a surface to air missile shot at me in Iraq. Trust me. You will never EVER forget being shot at or misremember the events wrote John Jacob Hunt.Another Mike Violette said He s an out and out liar. How NBC can keep him on air is beyond me. But prominent allies also leapt to the television star s defense. Revealing how some journalists like a pack of wolves are trying to take down Brian Williams. He apologized and set the record straight wrote actress Mia Farrow on Twitter.Former CBS anchor Dan Rather agreed. He is a superb pro and a gutsy one he said.

{"content": " Conduct an Internet search for masturbation and you will find hundreds if not thousands of slang phrases for the act.This proliferation of slang phrases suggests people want to talk about masturbation but are uncomfortable about doing so directly. Using comedic terms provides a more socially acceptable way to express themselves.So before we talk any more about it let s normalize it a bit. Masturbation or touching one s own genitals for pleasure is something that babies do from the time they are in the womb. It s a natural and normal part of healthy sexual development.According to a xa0nationally representative US sample 94 of men admit to masturbating as do 85 of women. But societal perspectives of masturbation still vary greatly and there s even some stigma around engaging in the act.Related to this stigma are the many myths about masturbation myths so ridiculous it s a wonder anyone believes them.They include masturbation causes blindness and insanity masturbation can make sexual organs fall off and masturbation causes infertility.In actual fact masturbation has many health benefits.Good for youFor women masturbation can help prevent cervical infections and urinary tract infections through the process of tenting or the opening of the cervix that occurs as part of the arousal process.Tenting stretches the cervix and thus the cervical mucous. This enables fluid circulation allowing cervical fluids full of bacteria to be flushed out.Masturbation can lower risk of type 2 diabetes though this association may also be explained by greater overall health reduce insomnia through hormonal and tension release and increase pelvic floor strength through the contractions that happen during orgasm.For men masturbation helps reduce risk of xa0prostate cancer probably by giving the prostate a chance to flush out potential cancer causing agents.Masturbation also improves xa0immune xa0functioning by increasing cortisol levels which can regulate immune functioning in small doses. It also reduces xa0depression xa0by increasing the amount of endorphins in the bloodstream.Masturbation can also indirectly prevent infertility by xa0protecting people xa0from sexually transmitted infections STIs that can lead to infertility you can t give yourself one of these infections There is one final benefit to masturbation it s the most convenient method for maximising orgasms.And there are plenty of additional benefits from orgasms generally xa0including xa0reduced stress reduced blood pressure increased self esteem and reduced pain.Good for your partner tooFrom a sexual health point of view masturbation is one of the safest sexual behaviors. There s no risk of pregnancy or transmission of sexually transmitted infections there s no risk of disappointing a partner or of performance anxiety and there s no emotional baggage.And only an arm s length away is mutual masturbation. Mutual masturbation two partners who are pleasuring themselves in the company of the other is a great and safe activity to incorporate into other partnered sexual activities.It can be especially good to begin to learn more about what your partner likes and to demonstrate to your partner what you like. Open communication with a partner will improve your sex life and relationship but is also important for modeling communication skills for younger generations.Talking about masturbation also has benefits. Promoting xa0sex positive views xa0in our own homes and in society including around masturbation allows us to teach young people healthy behaviors and attitudes without stigma and shame.Parents and guardians who feel embarrassed or need extra guidance to do this should seek out sex positive sources of information like xa0ones from respected universities. xa0Rappler.comThis article first appeared on The Conversation.Spring Chenoa Cooper xa0is a xa0Senior Lecturer University of Sydney Anthony Santella xa0is xa0Lecturer of HIV STIs and Sexual Health University of Sydney.

{"content": " PEACE PLAN. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande arrive in Moscow on February 6 to discuss with President Vladimir Putin a last minute peace initiative for Ukraine. Photo by Sergei Ilnitsky EPA MOSCOW Russia The leaders of Russia Germany and France agreed during late night talks in Moscow to draw up a plan to end fighting in Ukraine as rebels wage a deadly offensive in the country s east officials said Saturday February 7.A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than four hours of talks that wrapped up early Saturday saw the leaders agree on the drafting of a blueprint that would also include proposals from Ukraine s Petro Poroshenko. They were substantial and constructive Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters of the talks adding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande left swiftly afterward. Work is under way to prepare the text of a possible joint document to implement the Minsk agreements said Peskov referring to a widely flouted truce from September.A French official also called the talks constructive and substantial and said work was being done to pull together a document aimed at implementing the September truce.The three leaders who did not address the media after the meeting are to discuss the effort with Ukrainian President Poroshenko by telephone on Sunday February 8.The European pair s talks with the Kremlin strongman were seen an attempt to prevent the 10 month conflict in east Ukraine from spilling out of control as Washington considers whether to supply weapons to Kiev.The visit was Merkel s first to Moscow since the start of the Ukraine crisis while Hollande had made a brief stopover in December.Ahead of the talks Merkel played down hopes of a rapid end to the fighting that has claimed more than 5 300 lives since April.Merkel and Hollande first flew to Kiev on Thursday February 5 for discussions when US Secretary of State John Kerry also visited the Ukrainian capital.Kerry is set to meet Russia s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov at a security conference in Munich this weekend with the high level diplomacy seeking to resolve the worst East West crisis since the end of the Cold War. Russia cannot redraw map On Friday US Vice President Joe Biden said Ukraine was battling for survival in the face of escalating Russian military involvement. READ xa0US urges Russia to commit to ceasefire in Ukraine We the US and Europe as a whole have to stand with Ukraine at this moment Biden said in Brussels. Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe. President Putin continues to call for new peace plans as his troops roll through the Ukrainian countryside and he absolutely ignores every agreement his country has signed in the past Biden said.The West and Kiev accuse the Kremlin of sending troops and sophisticated weapons across the border to bolster separatists in Ukraine. Moscow has insisted it is not a party to the conflict.Observers have warned that if the United States gets involved militarily the regional conflict could reach a dangerous new stage and become a proxy war between Russia and the West.Russia is already under heavy Western sanctions over its alleged actions in Ukraine and European Union officials said Thursday that the bloc would blacklist more Russian individuals.The sanctions already in place along with low oil prices have dealt a blow to Russia s economy but have failed to force Putin to change tack over Ukraine.Ahead of the talks Hollande said a ceasefire should be the first step on the path to a comprehensive settlement. Kerry voiced support for what he called a helpful Franco German plan. READ xa0Putin Merkel Hollande urge Ukraine ceasefire President Putin can make the choices that could end this war he said.Evacuating civiliansRebel and Ukrainian forces on the ground agreed a ceasefire for several hours Friday around the battleground town of Debaltseve to allow civilians to leave both sides said.An Agence France Presse journalist in Debaltseve said some 25 city buses sent by both the rebels and the Kiev government left the shattered town to take civilians out although only one separatist bus was full.The sound of sporadic shelling could be heard in the distance but mortar bombardments in the town itself had halted after days of fierce fighting.Hundreds of civilians have been killed over recent weeks in east Ukraine as fighting spiralled after insurgents ignored the earlier truce deal and pushed into government held territory.One civilian and two soldiers were killed Friday and 25 wounded in fighting over the past 24 hours a government official said.

{"content": "\nAnyone familiar with special forces operations knows of the often dangerous rivalry between the Philippine military and the police \u2013 a rivalry that has killed those caught in the middle and foiled numerous operations\n,MOST WANTED: Top Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist 'Marwan' is the target of the PNP-SAF operation in Maguindanao ,Part 1 of 3,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Many are asking how ,Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir,, one of Southeast Asia\u2019s most wanted terrorists, has evaded arrest in the Philippines since 2003., ,The answer is simple: he burrowed into the fabric of Philippine society in often lawless areas that one US special forces officer called \u201cimpenetrable.\u201d In this 3-part series, Rappler looks at the man better known as Marwan through the eyes of 2 Filipinos who \u201cbecame family\u201d and worked closely with him on his terrorist plots: Aljebir Adzhar and Ren-Ren Dongon. Part 3 looks at Marwan's regional and global ties to terrorism.,The information comes from classified intelligence documents obtained over a decade of research from nearly half a dozen nations and verified by at least two independent sources. ,A US-educated engineer, Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: his brother was arrested in the United States in 2007 while another brother was arrested in Indonesia in 2001. ,Marwan is wanted in Malaysia for the killing of a Christian member of Parliament in 2000, the only successful al-Qaeda linked attack in Malaysia. Marwan was also a leader of Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM, which carried out those attacks. ,A senior leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, once al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia, Marwan fled to the Philippines in 2003, according to the US, to evade a regional crackdown and is one of the last surviving members of his group. One by one, his compatriots were tracked down and neutralized by authorities: Azahari Husin, the expert Malaysian bomb maker who allegedly trained Marwan; Dulmatin, who fled to the Philippines around the same time as Marwan, killed by Indonesian authorities when he returned home; and Umar Patek, who left the Philippines and was captured in Abbottabad, Pakistan (shortly before Osama bin Laden was killed in the same city) before being extradited to prison in Indonesia.,Marwan managed to evade ,the first-ever US smart bomb attack, in the Philippines against him in 2012 in Sulu. That operation did kill his long-time host, Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail Gumbahali, better known as Doc Abu.,He also evaded a second secret special operations attempt in July 2012, after he fled to ,the marshy swamplands in Butig, Lanao del Sur,, near the Moro Islamic Liberation Front\u2019s Camp Bushra.,Another operation had been planned as early as September 2014 \u2013 perhaps the reason why suspended Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Alan Purisima remained on top in the ,January 25 Mamasapano, attack that killed 44 elite cops. Planned under his watch, these operations are extremely sensitive. (Authorities claimed the January 25 operation killed Marwan but they are awaiting confirmation through DNA tests.),Weaknesses,Many are asking why the Armed Forces of the Philippines or AFP wasn\u2019t notified earlier. ,\u201cAnyone who actually has that question fundamentally doesn\u2019t understand the inability of the AFP and the PNP to protect sensitive information,\u201d a former US Special Forces officer told me a day after news of the 44 dead operatives came out.  \u201cIf they notify anybody, that operation is done. It\u2019ll leak out, and Marwan will be gone,\u201d said the American familiar with the territory.,Anyone familiar with special forces operations knows of the often dangerous rivalry between the Philippine military and the police \u2013 a rivalry that has killed those caught in the middle and foiled numerous operations. This is part of the reason these operations are kept on a tight need-to-know basis. ,Multiply that by the organizational rivalries of their US counterparts \u2013 the CIA working with Filipino special forces operatives and the FBI working with law enforcement. Then add conflicting vested interests of local and national Filipino politicians, and you begin to get a sense of the complex brew on the side of the authorities. ,Now add the societal landscape they need to navigate: an area where law and order is weak at best \u2013 full of clan rivalries, private armed groups and overlapping family ties in the middle of a splintering Muslim insurgency, with a significant group pushing for peace and a minority spoiling for war. ,Over the last 20 years, numerous Filipino and US officials have told me there is no choice but peace because the reality is that the Philippine military and police cannot win a war. ,Now you can begin to appreciate how difficult the situation is.,3 women and an in-law,Marwan\u2019s first weapon wasn\u2019t his ideology nor the bombs he made. It was his women: at least 3 Filipino wives who cemented him into the landscape.,Although he never admitted it when he was interrogated by authorities in December 2010, his police interrogators suspected Aljebir Adzhar, alias Embel, was one of Marwan\u2019s brothers-in-law.,Embel's father was a trusted aide of Abu Sayyaf leader Doc Abu: he and his men often stayed at Embel\u2019s family home in Parang, Sulu, where Embel said Doc Abu \u201chad mass support.\u201d Over time, Embel and his brother began helping Doc Abu, first by running errands as young boys then graduating to scouting government troop movements to alert the Abu Sayyaf. This is the extended social network that made it so dangerous for the police and military to enter communities unarmed.,Embel talked about how Doc Abu gave him P70,000 to buy a brand new black Honda motorcycle with yellow stripes. That was what he used to do the weekly shopping for Marwan, who gave him P1,500 a week to buy a sack of rice, coffee and bread at Love Life Bakery in Jolo. Embel said Marwan would give him extra money to buy chicken siopao, which Marwan loved.,Embel was also the conduit for Marwan\u2019s conjugal visits, which began with Embel picking up Marwan\u2019s wife from the Jolo market. Then 17 years old, Jaida is a Yakan from Basilan.  Embel said she normally wore slacks and a shirt with long, black sleeves and carried two suitcases. She also \u201ccovered her face.\u201d ,Embel would bring her to the house of the barangay captain, where he stayed behind. Then she would walk another 30 minutes alone to the house of Embel's family, where Marwan would meet her. She would normally stay with Marwan there for about a month unless a military operation happens, in which case she\u2019d go back to the barangay captain\u2019s house.,His family didn\u2019t just support the Abu Sayyaf. Embel\u2019s sister, Kasma, is married to a member of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 1996. Over the years, though, internal fighting has often spilled out into streets in Zamboanga, most recently in 2013. Embel said his sister and her family lived in the MNLF camp in Indanan, Sulu.,At least two of the men trained by Marwan during this time were from Cotabato and \u201chad a strong alliance with the MILF (the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 2014) in central Mindanao.\u201d,Collusion,Finally, there is collusion between those who hunt and the hunted.  ,In 2009, Embel said he became close to Italian Eugenio Vagni, one of 3 members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf under Albader Parad. Embel told authorities he and his brother helped feed Parad and his men, whom Embel claimed received a ransom of P60 million for the release of their hostages, although ICRC denied it paid ransom.,That ransom, according to Embel, was negotiated and given to the Abu Sayyaf by Parad's relative, then Vice Governor Lady Ann Sahidula, who later ran for \u2013 and won \u2013 a seat in Congress.,Here's where it turns into quicksand: Embel said the kidnapping was masterminded by a jail guard whose father is a regional police intelligence officer. Part of the ransom, Embel said, was given to members of the police.,Now you begin to see how the lines blur, and why there are often many shades of truth in this land.,In part 2, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the February 2012 US smart bomb attack through the eyes of another of Marwan\u2019s brother-in-law, Ren-Ren Dongon, whose family\u2019s interwoven marriages cemented alliances between the Abu Sayyaf, the Rajah Solaiman Movement and Jemaah Islamiyah. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Part 2: ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: Ren-Ren Dongon,Part 3:  ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: From family to global terrorism,Maria A.

The Court of Appeals issues a Writ of Kalikasan against a water company accused of building a dam that will deliver water from 4 rivers to Tagaytay City alone to the prejudice of other Cavite local governments. Photo from Drumlanrig from Wikimedia Commons,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Court of Appeals, through a Writ of Kalikasan, has ordered water company PTK2 H2O to stop extracting water from 4 rivers in Cavite. It also instructs the company to stop its construction of a dam and water delivery pipes in Indang town. (READ: ,Tagaytay tourism taking water away from Cavite residents?,),The Writ, issued on June 23, was sent to respondents PTK2 H2O, National Water and Resources Board (NWRB), Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) and Department of Environment and Natural Resources Region (DENR) Region IV.,The Writ, obtained by Rappler, orders them to \"cease and desist, pending resolution of this petition, from extracting water from the Ikloy, Indang, Lambak and Saluysoy rivers, from excavating, cutting trees and/or undertaking related construction works, and from implementing and/or executing any and all acts in furtherance of the alleged contracts and activities.\",The respondents were also ordered  to respond to the Writ within a \"non-extendible\" period of 10 days after receiving the document.,A Writ of Kalikasan is a legal remedy designed to protect a Filipino citizen's right to environmental protection. It may be used by any individual or group as protection from environmental damage that threatens the life, health and property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.,The order, issued by Presiding Justice Andres Reyes and Justices Manuel Barrios and Pedro Corales, was in response to a petition for Writ of Kalikasan with Prayer for Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) by Save the Water in Indang (SWIM), a group of concerned Cavite residents and environmental advocates.,The judges found the petition, submitted on June 18, \"sufficient in form and substance.\",Threatened water supply,SWIM accused PTK2 H2O of beginning a construction project that could threaten the water supply of Cavite province.,Documents showed that the water company had signed a deal with the TCWD to provide 50,000 cubic meters of water a day from the rivers. To fulfill their end of the bargain, PTK2 H2O has begun constructing water extraction facilities like a mini dam and pumping stations.,But scientific papers cited by the petition showed how this amount of water would bleed the rivers dry in a few years time. This could lead to water shortage for the 12 cities and municipalities who depend on the rivers.,The NWRB and DENR Region IV are blamed for greenlighting the project despite such studies and despite the lack of a proper environmental impact assessment.,But NWRB Executive Director Sevillo David Jr told Rappler that an Environmental Compliance Certificate is unnecessary for this type of project. He also gave assurances that the NWRB conducted their own study on Cavite's water supply and concluded that the PTK2 H2O project would not endanger it.,According to TCWD, they sought the services of PTK2 H2O because of the water crisis facing Tagaytay City once the commercial establishments and hotels currently being built are completed in a few years.,Tagaytay City is one of the most popular tourism destinations in Luzon because of its cool climate, proximity to Metro Manila and view of the majestic Taal Volcano. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61584-court-water-company-cavite", "title": "Court to water company: Stop extracting from Cavite rivers", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130937-zamboanga-del-norte-jalosjos-assassination-try,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/61027-tagaytay-cavite-indang-water-supply"},

Seeds were given to select schools in order to give them a headstart. Photo by Adrienne Villaruel/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines - What do you know about bio-intensive gardening? ,It is part of an initiative that aims to integrate a more sustainable approach in agriculture education in schools in the Philippines.,The International Institute for Rural Reconstruction (IIRR) launched the Integrated Approach to Address Food and Nutrition Security to combat undernutrition among school children.,The 3-year research project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and implemented by the IIRR, DepEd Cavite and Food and Nutrition Research Institute-Department of Science and Technology (FNRI-DOST).,Some 27 public elementary schools located in Cavite were identified as the main intervention schools. They are provided with equipment and training centered on a bio-intensive approach that complements the \u201cGulayan sa Paaralan\u201d program. ,(Read: Teaching ways to fight hunger),Child undernutrition remains a major obstacle for educators. The number of school children considered too thin for their height or \u201cseverely wasted\u201d stands at 534,054, according to 2012-2013 DepEd figures.,The 2013 United Nation Children\u2019s Fund Nutrition Report ranked the Philippines as the 9th country in the world with the most number of stunted children. This leads to hampered learning abilities and, eventually, poor educational outcomes. ,(Read: Learning on an empty stomach),Research components,The research comprises of three main components namely \u2013 Bio-intensive Gardening by IIRR, Supplementary Feeding Intervention by FNRI and Nutrition Education by FNRI and IIRR.,Bio-intensive Gardening (BIG) is a small-scale household biological approach to gardening. Contrary to the conventional gardening methods, it uses bio-intensive technology which aims to diversify the use of school lands through planting indigenous vegetables as a source of nourishment for school feeding programs.,The component targets the familiarization of agricultural teachers and students to the planting of indigenous crops which are more adaptable to climate change. It aims to make school gardens built from the Gulayaan sa Paaralan program more sustainable and ensure the longevity of the soil.,FUTURE GARDENING. Julian Gonsalvez explains how BIG can help schools improve agriculture education. Photo by Adrienne Villaruel/Rappler ,\u201cMost of these indigenous vegetables such as patani, bataw are drought tolerant. You can\u2019t buy these from seed companies which is why planting them is the best way to conserve them,\" IIRR Senior Program Adviser Julian Gonsalvez explained. ,Crop diversity improves soil fertility and keeps pests away better, according to the IIRR.,Bio-intensive Gardening uses small spaces of land that can be found in school gardens or backyards making it accessible for families and local government units. ,(Read: Eat 'indigenous' vegetables),Crop museums were also set up to re-introduce neglected underutilized vegetables. Apart from school gardens, families within the community are also given diverse seed varieties that can be grown with minimal attention.,As of now, the 27 intervention schools have shifted from conventional gardening to BIG, using organic fertilizers and growing more indigenous crops.,The Supplementary Feeding Intervention along with the Nutrition Education components use the indigenous vegetables to support the existing school feeding programs. For 120 days, 80 wasted children are identified in the chosen intervention schools to be served lunch composed of iron-fortified rice and vegetables. ,(Read: School feeding programs for Filipino kids),Recipes along with proper feeding practices are taught to parents in order to change poor nutrition at home.,According to Gonsalvez, most parents are often working busy jobs and have the tendency to neglect children\u2019s nutrition and just feed them what\u2019s convenient.

{"content": "\nEXCLUSIVE: Two top terrorist leaders are said to be hiding in Lanao del Sur, a known MILF stronghold. This poses a new challenge to the peace process.    ,MANILA, Philippines - Classified documents and maps obtained by Rappler show the terrorist targets of ,the first smart bomb attack, in the Philippines early this year are still alive and have now found sanctuary in central Mindanao, in a territory controlled by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). ,This poses a new challenge to the peace process between the government and the MILF. Both sides resumed their talks Tuesday, July 17.,The two most senior Jemaah Islamiyah or JI leaders in the Philippines are Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, who carries a US$5-M reward on his head, and Singaporean Mohammad Abdullah Ali, known as Muawiyah, who has a $500,000 reward for his capture or kill. ,Civilian and military intelligence sources from the Phiippines, Malaysia and the United States confirmed to Rappler that the two escaped the joint Phiippine-US smart bomb operation on Feb 2, 2012, which killed their long-time host, Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail Gumbahali, better known as Doc Abu. ,They are now in Butig, Lanao del Sur, near the MILF's Camp Bushra, seen clearly in satellite maps obtained by Rappler and verified by Philippine and US intelligence sources. ,Despite this, the Philippine military continues to insist that the two were killed in the February attack.,When asked by Rappler about the alleged presence of the two JI leaders in MILF territory, Mohagher Iqbal, head of the MILF panel holding peace talks with the government, said: \"The MILF also received that report... but our AHJAG is validating this on the ground.\",TALKING PEACE. MILF chief peace negotiator Mohaguer Iqbal. File photo,From Sulu to Lanao,According to classified Philippine intelligence reports, Marwan and Muawiyah were sheltered in Sulu for nearly two weeks by an Abu Sayyaf member belonging to the group of Radullan Sahiron, the most senior leader of the Abu Sayyaf today. Sahiron allegedly blamed the two for the death of Doc Abu, Sahiron\u2019s close friend. Their two groups often worked together against the military and in kidnap-for-ransom cases. ,\u201cThese two men were not in the kill zone,\u201d said Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore. \u201cIn the battlefield, such confusions can always take place, but today, the Philippine military is much more capable than what it was.  It\u2019s only a question of time that Muawiyah and Marwan will be either captured or killed.\u201d,The documents say Marwan and Muawiyah fled Patikul, Sulu, as early as February 27 after Sahiron and his cousin, MNLF commander Tahil Sali, pushed them out of the area. They were allegedly picked up by another Abu Sayyaf leader, Isnilon Hapilon, and travelled by boat to an area in Butig, Lanao del Sur, near the MILF\u2019s Camp Bushra.,Intelligence sources in Singapore and the Philippines told Rappler Muawiyah has called family members in Singapore since then. ,Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: one brother was arrested in Indonesia for a failed bomb plot; the other brother was arrested in the United States. Marwan is also wanted in Malaysia for the killing of a Christian member of Parliament in 2000, the only successful al-Qaeda linked attack in Malaysia. Marwan is also a leader of Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia or KMM, which carried out those attacks.,Filipino intelligence sources also told Rappler that the two men are travelling with pregnant Filipino women, believed to be their wives.,MILF and peace talks,Their area of refuge now becomes tricky because the MILF is in the middle of peace talks with the Philippine government. Chief government negotiator Marvic Leonen says he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the two sides will reach an agreement this year. ,\u201cIn 2006, the MILF committed actually to assist government and interdict lawless elements, and this is via an Ad Hoc Action Group (AHJAG),\u201d said Leonen in a recent interview on #TalkThursday. \u201cThe government has turned over to the MILF a list of its high-value targets (HVTs), and we hope that the MILF soon enough will keep to their commitments in 2006.\u201d,Both Leonen and Iqbal pointed out that AHJAG has helped resolve incidents of kidnapping, without ransom paid, and is part of the reason open conflict has been minimized this year.,Chief government negotiator Marvic Leonen,The difficulty is that the MILF also gave JI sanctuary from the mid-90's until 2005, when the MILF Central Command threw them out, along with the Abu Sayyaf and the Rajah Solaiman Movement. That was when JI members fled to Sulu.,\u201cIt\u2019s a reality that many of those that are lawless do have relatives within communities where MILF may be influential or dominant, and therefore, it may be natural that in some instances, they would come home and seek succor under their protection,\u201d added Leonen.,Marwan and Muawiyah pose a new challenge to the peace process. \"They are the two most important foreign terrorists currently operating in Southeast Asia,\" said Gunaratna. \"They are the two most important foreign international terrorists operating in the Philippines.\" -, Rappler.com, , , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/8719-jemaah-islamiyah-leaders-in-central-mindanao-classified-documents-amp-maps", "title": "2 JI leaders now in MILF territory - reports", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/nation/2910-us-smart-bombs-used-in-sulu-attack"},

When he texted that he was leaving the camp, the soldiers watched his thermal image walk away.,Scan eagles, also known as drones, have been operating in the Philippines for many years now.,Although originally flown from US navy ships and operated by civilian contractors, there are smaller drones operated by US special forces. Don\u2019t mistake these for the Predator drones and Global Hawks carrying hell fire missiles that killed Al-Qaeda and other terrorist targets in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ,In the Philippines, drones are used only for surveillance. ,This was confirmed by ,Philippine President Benigno Aquino III on Tuesday, largely because a drone strike handled by the Americans may violate the Philippine Constitution. US troops, Mr Aquino said, \u201care here as advisers. They are here as trainers. They cannot participate in combat operations.\u201d,Which is exactly what they have been doing. ,The US military arrived in the Philippines in February 2002, dubbed the second front in its \u201cwar against terrorism.\u201d At its peak, US troops reached 1,200, including 660 US special forces.,The military alliance also includes technology transfer.  ,In mid-2010, Washington pledged ,$18.4 million of precision-guided missiles, funded under a US Congressional Act, which allowed its defense department to train and equip foreign military allies.,A classified document from the Philippines is explicit: \"Fiscal year 2010 assistance for the Philippines provides a precision-guided missile capability to assist Philippine Armed Forces' counter-terrorism efforts in southern regions to combat the activities of the Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf Group.\",November arrival,The first smart bombs, PGMs or Precision-Guided Munitions kits, arrived in the Philippines on November 1, 2010. ,According to a technical timeline obtained by Rappler, Philippine Air Force pilots sat down with subject matter experts to lay out a training plan in December. ,Weapons training began the following year, on Jan 24, 2011.,Two months later, aircraft installation & training started, leading to test drops which were scheduled to begin in May of the same year. ,On June 20, 2011, the US delivered at least 22 more PGM kits to the Philippine military. ,During this period, US defense contractor Raytheon, the company which makes the PGMs, visited the Philippines 3 times, according to the documents.,Finally, on Feb 2, 2012, after nearly 8 months of training, the Philippines deployed its first smart bombs. ,Target: JI in Sulu,The targets had long been under surveillance: the 2 most senior Jemaah Islamiyah or JI leaders in the Philippines sheltered by Abu Sayyaf leader Umbra Jumdail, better known as Doc Abu. ,They are Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, who carried a $5-M reward on his head from the US government, and Singaporean Mohammed Abdullah Ali, known as Muawiyah, who had a $500,000 reward for his capture or death.,\u201cThere was a target that was of high enough value with actionable intelligence and the right conditions that would warrant its use,\u201d said a military source privy to the operations. \u201cThese are expensive devices so they are used for the right targets at the right time.\u201d,There was a long, involved process to get to this point, governed by protocols set by both nations, according to documents obtained by Rappler.,The Philippines and the US followed 2 levels of clearance and parallel approval processes.,First, ground commanders from both nations identify a target. For the Americans, its Joint-Special Operations Task Force-Philippines (JSOTF-P) then coordinates with the US Embassy before getting approval from SOCPAC, the Special Operations Command, Pacific in Hawaii.  ,After SOCPAC approves, it alerts the US Pacific Command (PACOM). Then it goes back to JSOTF-P which then notifies its Philippine counterpart of concurrence for the target.  ,On the Philippine side, the commander of the Joint Task Force Comet (Sulu's military unit) coordinates with the Western Mindanao Command (WESTMINCOM) and when US concurrence happens, WESTMINCOM approves the target and authorizes execution by Filipino troops.,BLAST SITE. Sitio Lanao Bato, Sulu. Picture taken at 12:12pm on February 2, 2012,Between 2 and 3 am on February 2, Philippine Air Force OV-10 Broncos dropped the 227 kg (500 lb) bombs in the strike zone in a remote village in Parang, Sulu, demolishing much of the area. ,In the dark,The first signal that new technology was used was the choice of when to drop the bombs.,In the past, planes could only drop their payload during daylight because pilots used visual cues.  ,Now the smart bombs can strike in the dark because they are guided by GPS or a homing device.,About 45 minutes after the bombing, the military asset texted his handlers that he would check \u201cthe targets.\u201d  ,Sources said they watched a thermal image move back to the area. His text said that Doc Abu had been \u201cobliterated.\u201d  Marwan was allegedly \u201ccut in half from the waist,\u201d while Muawiyah was barely breathing with blood gushing out of a deep neck wound.,Based on that, the Philippine military ,announced, the deaths of these key leaders.,Wrong info,But it now appears that the asset was wrong about Marwan and Muawiyah. ,Civilian and military intelligence reports from at least 3 countries show, both JI leaders are still alive,. ,Last week, Malaysia's chief counterterrorism official Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said Marwan was still alive. ,Philippine military spokesman Col Arnulfo Marcelo Burgos maintained his position the JI leaders are dead and said Malaysia should provide \"conclusive proof of life.\" ,On the use of smart bombs, there are conflicting responses from the Philippines. ,Col. Burgos, based in Manila, said the military, \"neither confirms nor denies the existence of such munitions citing operational security reasons. However, its pilots have been training vigorously to further improve their proficiency particularly in the precise delivery of munitions to its identified target.\",Col Jose Cenabre, the head of Sulu's Task Force Comet, categorically denied the use of smart bombs: \"I strongly deny that. That's just talk. We did not use them.\",However, Lt Col Miguel Ernesto Okol, spokesman of the Philippine Air Force, told Rappler: \u201cOur pilots\u2019 accuracy in the past was not good. They were not adept, but now with considerable time training and through the advice of our allies, particularly the US military, we are able to increase the accuracy of our pilots to 80 to 90%.\u201d - ,with reports from David Santos/Rappler.com, ,Maria Ressa, ,is the author of ,Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of Al-Qaeda's Newest Center of Operations in Southeast Asia ,(Free Press, 2003).

{"content": "\nEXCLUSIVE: Philippine police discover a black flag during a raid in Zamboanga, the same black flag that militant Muslims raised in their recent protests in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen \n,MANILA, Philippines - Philippine police discovered a black flag in an Abu Sayyaf camp in Zamboanga City last week, the same black flag that has appeared in violent Muslim protests around the world.,The black flag taps into a secret motivation of al-Qaeda: a \u201cnarrative that convinces them that they\u2019re part of a divine plan, \u201d according to former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Ali Soufan in his book ,\"The Black Banners: The Inside Story of 9/11 and the War Against al-Qaeda.\", ,Al-Qaeda believes its black banners herald the apocalypse that would bring about the triumph of Islam. ,It\u2019s based on what they believe is a hadith or a saying of the prophet Muhammad: \u201cIf you see the black banners coming from Khurusan, join that army, even if you have to crawl over ice; no power will be able to stop them, and they will finally reach Baitul Maqdis [Jerusalem], where they will erect their flags.\u201d Khurusan is a name for a historical region covering northeastern and eastern Iran and parts of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan.,This is where al-Qaeda believes the Islamic version of Armaggedon will emerge. Osama bin Laden\u2019s 1996 declaration of war against the United States ends with the dateline, \u201cFriday, August 23, 1996, in the Hindu Kush, Khurusan, Afghanistan.\u201d,Symbol of Victory,After a mob stormed the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya and killed 4 Americans, including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, they raised the black flag. US officials named an al-Qaeda-linked group which they said took advantage of an anti-Islam film protest to launch an attack. ,In a little more than a week, protests spread to more than 20 countries with more than 30 people killed. Black flags were raised by angry mobs in countries like Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen. ,Al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni branch, AQAP (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) has said the attack in Libya was to avenge the June killing of its number two, Abu Yahya al-Libi, and urged Muslims to kill US diplomats in Muslim countries.,Last Thursday, September 20, authorities in the Philippines ,stormed an Abu Sayyaf training camp in Zamboanga City, and freed Chinese hostage, Yuan-Kai Lin. ,During the 20-minute battle, police forces said they wounded Abu Sayyaf leader Khair Mundos, who carries a US$500,000 reward from the US Department of Justice. Mundos managed to escape however.,Mundos was captured in 2004 and confessed he arranged funds for terrorist attacks in Mindanao. Working with his brothers, they funneled money from Saudi Arabia to the Abu Sayyaf, which has had a historical link to al-Qaeda. ,As early as 1988, al-Qaeda's financial network in the Philippines was established by Osama bin Laden\u2019s brother-in-law, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, and al-Qaeda leaders, including the architect of the 9/11 attacks, have trained members of the Abu Sayyaf.,Mundos escaped from a provincial prison in 2007 and headed the Abu Sayyaf group in Basilan. During last week's raid, intelligence sources tell Rappler they found the black flag as well as training manuals from Jemaah Islamiyah, once al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia, inside the camp.,This is not the first time the black flag surfaced in the Philippines. ,Filipinos carry the black flag in the southern Philippines,YouTube campaign,On Nov 6, 2011, a masked Filipino jihadist identified as ,Commander Abu Jihad Khalil al-Rahman al-Luzoni uploaded a video on YouTube, exhorting Muslims around the world to support the jihad in the Philippines. He gave his Arabic message in front of al-Qaeda\u2019s black flag. ,Authorities have since identified him as Khalil Pareja, the leader of the Rajah Solaiman Movement or RSM, a group which worked with Jemaah Islamiyah and the Abu Sayyaf on the Superferry bombing in 2004 and the Valentine's Day bombings in 2005. Using YouTube and Facebook, Pareja took the jihad online and began to work on Facebook with alleged members of al-Shabaab in Somalia and AQAP in Yemen. According to classified documents obtained by Rappler, soon after Pareja was arrested early this year, he told authorities he planned to join the jihad in Yemen, along with other Filipinos.  His Facebook page used the black flag.,Other websites and video messages around the world, including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen prominently display the black flag. In the Philippines, authorities are monitoring a website called ,Islamic Emirate of the Philippines: The Black Flag Movement,. ,One post titled \u201cThe True Islamic Hero,\u201d shows a picture of former AQAP leader Anwar al-Awlaki as well as other al-Qaeda operatives with Arabic titles and translations. It includes links to other extremist websites, including those run by al-Qaeda and its proxies. The site includes news updates as well as photographs of a breakaway faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front led by Ameril Umra Kato, who sheltered leaders of Jemaah Islamiyah or JI.,While all public measuring systems show activity on the site isn\u2019t alarming, it provides a gateway for radicals: there\u2019s a \u201cContact us\u201d portion, an online poll and a donation portal.  Although it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s any real world link to al-Qaeda, it\u2019s clearly inspired by al-Qaeda lore and subculture.,In August, authorities in the Philippines recovered video explaining the black flag inside the laptop of a Malaysian jihadist during an attack targeting the two most wanted Southeast Asian terrorists, JI leaders Marwan and Muawiyah \u2013 ,the targets of the first US smart bomb attack in the Philippines, last February in Jolo. Both escaped and, fled to central Mindanao,.,The Malaysian who owned the laptop with the black flag video arrived in the Philippines in April 2012 and found his way to the central Mindanao camp of Marwan and Muawiyah.  Both escaped again. ,Among the weapons and rocket launchers recovered by authorities, they also found a hardcover book written in English. Its title is \"Islami Emirate Afghanistan.\" Below that was the logo of the Islamic Emirate of the Philippines.,The centralized command structures of both al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah collapsed in the decade after 9/11, but old networks and cells remain continuing to spread its virulent ideology.  Now smaller, more ad hoc and less professional cells carry out attacks without central coordination.  The challenge for authorities is how to contain a social movement that simmers just beneath the surface. -, Rappler.com,(Editor's note: This is the second part of a Rappler series and includes excerpts of ,Maria Ressa\u2019,s upcoming book, \"10 Days, 10 Years: FROM BIN LADEN TO FACEBOOK.\" Set to be published in October, it includes research done for the International Center for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore and the Naval Postgraduate School\u2019s CORE Lab in the US.)", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/13051-al-qaeda", "title": "Al-Qaeda's black flag seized in ASG camp", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/nation/12846-philippine-forces-rescue-chinese-hostage,-kill-kidnappers,http://www.rappler.com/nation/12217-youtube,-facebook-link-filipino-terrorists-to-al-qaeda-amp-global-jihad"},

{"content": "\nMore than half a million Filipino schoolchildren are thin for their height. How does this impact on the country's future?     ,HUNGER KNOWS NO AGE. Undernutrition continues to be a public health problem among students across all ages. Illustration by Mara Elize Mercado/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 More than half a million or 534,054 Filipino schoolchildren are severely wasted, according to 2012-2013 figures of the Department of Education (DepEd). Wasted means they are thin for their height.,The World Food Programme (WFP) defines \"wasting\" as a \u201crecent and severe process that leads to substantial weight loss, associated with starvation.\u201d It is a symptom of acute undernutrition that impairs the immune system \u2013 increasing the child\u2019s susceptibility to infectious diseases and death.,A decline in children\u2019s nutritional status signals an eventual decline in their academic performance.,This is dismaying since these students will someday grow up to become the backbone of Philippine society. They will be our nation\u2019s future decision-makers, leaders, and producers.,If their minds and bodies are feeble now, just imagine what the Philippines will be in the years to come. Asia\u2019s \u201crising tiger\u201d may become a limping cub.,Hungry preschoolers, teens,The ,latest findings ,by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (FNRI-DOST) from 2011 show that among children under 5 years old, protein-energy malnutrition was a problem: 20.2% were underweight (thin for their age), 33.6% were stunted (short for their age), and 7.3% were wasted (thin for their height). ,This age group is crucial since this is when children are most vulnerable to infections and diseases, while their nutritional needs are also increasing. Physical and mental damages at this point will be irreversible. ,This period is a \"window of opportunity for nutrition intervention,\" according to FNRI-DOST.,Meanwhile, among 5-10-year-olds, 32% were underweight, 33.6% were stunted, and 8.5% were wasted. Among 10-19-year-olds, 35.7% were stunted and 12.7% were wasted.,These figures barely changed since the 2008 survey. FNRI-DOST warned that undernutrition continues to be a public health problem among Filipino children.,The Philippines is the, 9,th, country ,in the world with the most number of stunted children, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef).,Stunting results from long-term nutritional deprivation. It is manifested not only in shortness-for-age, but also in delayed mental development, poor school performance, and reduced intellectual capacity.,Meanwhile, the most recent Global School-based Health Survey by the World Health Organization (WHO) from 2011 reported that 11.8% of surveyed Filipino students aged 13-15 years old were underweight.,Hunger disregards the age of its victims; both kindergartners and teenagers can fall prey.,Hungry body, hungry mind,A student\u2019s life can be exhilarating, but also exhausting \u2013 physically and mentally. What does undernutrition do to these young minds and bodies?,Hunger, a preventable yet persisting problem, hinders children from achieving their full potential.,Unicef says that \u201ceven short-term hunger can adversely affect a child\u2019s ability to learn.\u201d,Undernutrition makes a child more vulnerable to diseases, disabilities, and death. It also disrupts a child\u2019s mental and physical development \u2013 which may lead to poor productivity in adulthood.,Concentration, critical thinking, creativity, and even their social abilities may be negatively affected. Instead of focusing on class activities, they may also be too distracted by pangs of hunger.,Micronutrient deficiencies, impair physical and cognitive development, lower intellectual capacity, and lessen productivity. Vitamin A deficiency may cause blindness, while iodine or iron deficiencies reduce a child\u2019s IQ, cognitive and motor skills.,Unicef also warns that worm infestation causes anemia and poor growth development.,Some students who do not have enough money for food attend classes with an empty stomach or choose junk food as an alternative. Their parents are unable to feed them nutritious meals due to lack of resources or information regarding healthy and affordable meal preparations.,Poor school performance,The ,2012 results ,of the National Achievement Test (NAT) revealed that the Mean Percentage Score (MPS) of Grade 3 pupils in the country was 56.98%. This is lower than the 2011 results (59.58%) and the 2007 initial results (57.42%). English, Math, and Science scores dropped slightly. ,Among 6,th, graders, MPS was 66.79%. This is slightly lower than the 2011 NAT Results (68.14%), but higher than the 2006 initial results (59.94%). There was also an increase in the scores in all subjects from 2006 to 2012.,Among high school seniors, MPS was 48.90% which is classified as lower average; however, this is still slightly higher than the 2005 initial results (46.80%).,Poor nutrition, however, is not the sole reason behind these test scores. These numbers paint an even bigger picture of Philippine education, assessing not only the performance of students, but also of parents, educators, and the government.,Children\u2019s nutrition as an investment,Investment on children\u2019s nutrition begins at home.,Parents are expected to provide the basic needs of their children, including clean, sufficient, and nutritious food.,But this investment does not end at home; the government must also educate and support its people, especially the poor who are most vulnerable to hunger.,Unicef says that \u201cwell-nourished children perform better in school, grow into healthier adults and are able to give their own children a better start in life.\u201d,In the long run, investing in children's nutrition will benefit the country's economy and future generation. \u201cWhen populations are well nourished, higher individual productivity, lower health care costs and greater economic output will ensue,\u201d Unicef says.,Go, Grow, Glow,GO GROW GLOW. Children must eat these three basic food groups every day to ensure optimal growth and development. Illustration by Mara Elize Mercado/Rappler,The National Nutrition Council (NNC) emphasizes the role of good nutrition in child development.,NNC advises children to eat a variety of nutritious meals everyday \u2013 including ,go, (for energy), ,grow, (for tissue and muscle development), and ,glow, foods (for body regulation and protection).,Other reminders include:,Vicious cycle,WFP sees the \u201cpoverty trap\u201d as one of the leading causes of hunger. Families living in extreme poverty cannot afford nutritious meals; hence compromising their health \u2013 which then limits their opportunities for school, skills training, and work.,When these problems persist, families are \u201ccondemned to a life of hunger and poverty.\u201d These malnourished children may grow up to become unhealthy parents, repeating the same cycle.,The Philippines is the, 5,th, country, in the world with the most school drop-outs, next to India, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Nigeria, according to a 2013 report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). ,Some students with problems in their studies, finances, health, or families tend to quit school.,Meanwhile, some parents opt to not send their children to school, fearing the financial burdens of education \u2013 tuition and other school fees, allowance, food, daily transportation, books, uniforms, school supplies, and projects. ,Instead of studying, some children choose or are forced to work to augment their family income, while also risking their health and wellbeing. Unfortunately, some of them also fall into a life of vice or crime.,Not only are these children giving up education, they are also giving up their childhood and their future. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/49193-learning-empty-stomach", "title": "Learning on an empty stomach", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161465-pagasa-defends-scientists-amid-project-noah-takeover"},

It was a video of himself, wearing a camouflage jacket and a mask covering his face and head. He was speaking in Arabic and asking Muslims around the world to support and contribute to the jihad in the Philippines.  ,Identified as Commander Abu Jihad Khalil al-Rahman al-Luzoni, the man on the video called on Muslims to unite and help their brethren, saying there was \u201cno way to restore the Islamic Caliphate and the glory of the religion but through jihad.\u201d, ,It was the first of its kind for the Philippines, triggering a wave of videos, letters and audio messages from Filipino jihadists which were promoted on al-Qaeda linked sites and jihadist websites like Shumukh al-Islam and Ansar al-Mujahideen English Forum (AMEF).  ,They declared allegiance to al-Qaeda online and on social networks.  , ,Intelligence sources from 3 different countries told Rappler that Abu Jihad Khalil, the man with the long hair, is 31-year old Khalil Pareja, a Christian convert to Islam who took over the leadership of the Rajah Solaiman Movement (RSM) in 2005.  ,RSM worked closely with the Abu Sayyaf (ASG) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia. Their alliance carried out at least two attacks: the Superferry bombing in 2004, one of the world\u2019s worst maritime terrorist attacks and the second most lethal in Southeast Asia since the 2002 Bali bombing; and the Valentine\u2019s Day bombings in 2005 \u2013 two near-simultaneous explosions in General Santos City and Davao City, followed an hour later by an explosion on a bus in Makati., ,A Philippine intelligence report obtained and verified by Rappler said that Pareja not only posted jihadi materials on YouTube, he was also active on Facebook \u2013 a case study of how one man can connect jihadists and terrorists from multiple countries through social media., ,About a month before he posted his YouTube video, Pareja told authorities he joined the Arabic Student Forum on Facebook. Several of the members asked him if he knew Abu Jihad, but he said he was cautious about security. Then he received a private message (PM) from a man who introduced himself as Gerald. They became friends and started chatting regularly., ,Over time, Gerald told Pareja he was a member of al-Shabaab, Islamist militants who control much of southern Somalia. The relationship between al-Shabaab and al-Qaeda dates back to the 1990\u2019s.,Most lethal affiliate,It seems Osama bin Laden\u2019s death in 2011 helped pave the way for ,closer ties between the two groups,. In February 2012, al-Shabaab\u2019s leadership pledged allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who replaced bin Laden as al-Qaeda\u2019s new leader. This was announced on a video uploaded on the Internet by al-Qaeda\u2019s media arm. ,This agreement showed that despite bin Laden\u2019s death, al-Qaeda continues to grow., ,Pareja told Gerald he was Abu Jihad. Gerald invited him to go to Yemen to join the jihad led by al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni affiliate, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP. Counterterrorism analysts characterize AQAP as the ,\u201cmost active and lethal Qaeda affiliate, intent on striking at both the US homeland and regional targets.\u201d,  , ,In mid-2012, US authorities used a CIA sting operation to foil an AQAP plot to bomb US-bound airplanes with explosives hidden in the bodies of terrorists. Experts said AQAP\u2019s master bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, had been working on body bombs, explosives surgically implanted in either the stomach or rectal cavity. ,AQAP was also involved in other foiled plots against US targets,: the \u201cunderwear bomb\u201d used in an attempt to take down Northwest Flight 253 in 2009 and the \u201cprinter bombs\u201d in the failed cargo bomb plot in 2010., ,One of its leaders, American Anwar al-Awlaki was a ,\u201cmaster in the use of the Internet.\u201d, And although he was killed by the US in 2011, his messages continue to resonate and win recruits online.  ,Awlaki was prolific on YouTube; among those he influenced were the London attackers who carried out Britain\u2019s 9/11 on July 7, 2005 (commonly referred to as 7/7). He had his own website (now taken down by authorities) which attracted extremists and the head of AQAP, bin Laden\u2019s secretary, Nasir al-Wuhaishi. He consulted bin Laden and appointed Awlaki the head of AQAP\u2019s external operations, in charge of terrorist attacks outside Yemen and Saudi Arabia.,Awlaki was a cyberworld superstar because he was an eloquent speaker, and he understood the virtual world. His ideas remain with AQAP, which continues his online recruitment efforts., ,Pareja said Gerald told him AQAP \u201chad established an Islamic state in the province of Abian in Yemen\u201d and had already recruited \u201cFilipinos studying from the Islamic schools in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Sudan.\u201d  He asked Pareja to join the jihad in Yemen and help lead the Filipinos. He said they would stay in Yemen for 10 years.  ,After 5 years, they could choose to return to the Philippines, at which point AQAP \u201cwould provide them funds to continue jihad to establish an Islamic Caliphate.\u201d Gerald offered to pay for Pareja\u2019s travel expenses to Yemen. Pareja accepted the offer and was scheduled to travel between April and June of 2012. , ,He never made it because Filipino authorities arrested him on March 1.  , ,Today, the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaeda has been degraded but it has evolved and grown into a social movement.  It continues to spread its virulent ideology \u2013 this time in the virtual world and on social media., ,This is the battleground of the future. - ,Rappler.com, ,(Editor's note: This is the first part of a Rappler series and includes excerpts of ,Maria Ressa\u2019,s upcoming book, \"10 Days, 10 Years: From Bin Laden to Facebook.\" Set to be published in October, it includes research done for the International Center for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore and the Naval Postgraduate School\u2019s CORE Lab in the US.)", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/12217-youtube,-facebook-link-filipino-terrorists-to-al-qaeda-amp-global-jihad", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: YouTube, Facebook link Filipino terrorists to al-Qaeda", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/world/4663-al-qaeda-afghanistan-1-year-after-bin-laden-s-death"},

The cutouts on her Michael Cinco dress might have been more daring than usual for the Teen Queen, but the cut kept her looking classy and elegant. ,Tootsy Angara in Rajo Laurel , ,Tootsy's look for the Star Magic Ball was all geometric shapes and lines. Tootsy's modern look by Rajo Laurel was cut in all the right places, and showed just the right amount of skin. Tootsy also wore a white gown to the 2014 Star Magic Ball, but this one doesn't recall that at all and had its own shining moment on the red carpet. ,Denise Laurel in Vania Romoff , ,Denise channeled Old Hollywood glamour with her hair let down and wavy, and in a sleek, shiny number that looked like liquid silver when it moved. On the wrong person a slit that high wouldn't have worked \u2013 on Denise, it was a contrasting feature to the rest of the gown's sculpted structure, worn comfortably and well. ,Julia Barretto in Mark Bumgarner , , ,Julia might have kept it sweet and airy in her pink gown by Mark Bumgarner, but the actress kept her look mature with a slimmer silhouette. No poofy gown, no over-embellishment. ,Maja Salvador in Rajo Laurel , ,Maja's champagne gown by Rajo Laurel was beautiful for its pleating and silhouette, but she amped up the look with all the right accessories. Her gold clutch didn't clash with the rest of the outfit, and she kept the rest of the look simple. ,Maja stood tall and serene on the red carpet, and ultimately that's what made her shine., ,KZ Tandingan in Yang Bautista , ,KZ looked fierce in a Yang Bautista number paired with bold lips. The singer has never been afraid to rock an edgy look, and her outfit at the Star Magic Ball 2015 was no exception.,More than anything, it's KZ's confidence, strong poses, and all-around cool vibe that make the look overall. ,What were your favorite looks from the ball?

November 28, 1970, while Pope John Paul II visited twice on February 18, 1981 and January 13, 1995.,A shift is observed, however, from previous popes' to Francis' tone in discussing the Catholic Church's take on various issues \u2013 from ,not judging homosexuals, and ,atheists being moral,.,Francis has been vocal in highlighting compassion instead of legalism, which focuses on what he calls \"small-minded rules,\" in tackling pressing problems of the modern world. ,Named ,TIME, Person of the Year in 2013,, Francis believes the church to be a field hospital where the first duty is to take

Screengrab from Nokia  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Before Android and iPhones took over the world, it was Nokia that dominated the mobile phone business. Its eventual decline, the last chapter of which was helmed by tech giant Microsoft, was a sad sight for consumers who grew up with Nokia phones. ,Like the phones themselves, however, the brand has shown great resilience. The brand lives on, with Microsoft having sold the Nokia phone business to two companies: FIH and the ,young Finnish company HMD Global, back in May. The former will be manufacturing the devices while the latter will be selling and marketing the devices.  ,In a ,post, on the HMD website dated December 13, the resurrection appears to be nearing completion. The company has revealed its first Nokia phones since securing rights to the brand: the Nokia 150 and the Nokia 150 Dual Sim. These two phones will be the first new Nokia devices to release since Microsoft's final offering, the 216, arrived in October.,But don't get excited just yet. The 150 and 150 Dual Sim are not the Android devices that HMD previously announced they would make \u2013 although those are still most likely arriving.,Instead, we're getting a feature phone running on Nokia's Series 30+ operating system that boasts 22 hours of talk time and a VGA camera with LED flash. It has a 2.4-inch screen and has a suggested retail price of US $26. It's set to come out in the first quarter of 2017 in the Asia-Pacific (APAC), India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA) and Europe. ,Here are the full specs: ,Operating system: Nokia Series 30+,Display: 2,4\u201d QVGA (240*320),Battery: BL-5C ,1020 mAh4,Talk time: up to 22 hours,Standby time: up to 31 days for Single SIM, and up to 25 days for Dual SIM ,Camera: VGA with LED flash,Connectivity: 900/1800 MHz, micro USB, 3.5mm AV connector, Bluetooth 3.0 with SLAM,Memory: MicroSD card support up to 32GB5,Dimensions: 118.0x50.2x13.5mm,81.0g (including battery) ,Visit the product page ,here,. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/155512-new-nokia-feature-phones-unveiled", "title": "New Nokia feature phones unveiled", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/154250-nokia-brand-smartphone-comeback"},

Roxas is also the chairman of the National Police Commission.,Roxas, however, said he was not privy to the operation in Maguindanao. Neither was PNP OIC Espina. The commander of the PNP SAF, Police Director Getulio Nape\u00f1as, Jr., meanwhile, has been administratively relieved over the incident.,In a televised address Wednesday evening, January 28, ,President Benigno Aquino III said he was coordinating with Nape\u00f1as prior to the operation,. The president, however, did not categorically answer if he gave the go signal for the operation or not.,The PNP has since launched a Board of Inquiry to probe the incident. The MILF has also spearheaded its own independent review of the incident. The board will have to find out why top PNP officials were kept out of the loop.,The MILF and the Philippine government are in the final stages of a peace deal that would establish a new autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao. The development of the deal is now in limbo, following the clash.,At least two senators have withdrawn their support for the Bangsamoro Basic Law, meaning a majority is no longer in favor of the measure. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/82277-mamasapano-slain-pnp-saf-return-home", "title": "Hero\u2019s welcome: Slain PNP-SAF back home", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130937-zamboanga-del-norte-jalosjos-assassination-try,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/nation/81883-pnp-saf-maguindanao-terrorists,http://www.rappler.com/nation/81968-pnp-saf-zamboanga-maguindanao"},

File photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler  ,MANILA, Philippines (5th UPDATE) \u2013 In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court (SC) decided to save Senator Grace Poe from disqualification as presidential candidate in the 2016 elections. ,The SC en banc on Tuesday, March 8, voted, ,9-6 to reverse the decision of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) ,to cancel Poe's certificate of candidacy (COC),.,Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno was among the 9 justices who voted in favor of Poe. The rest are Presbitero Velasco Jr, Diosdado Peralta, Lucas Bersamin, Jose Perez, Jose Mendoza, Marvic Leonen, Francis Jardeleza, and Benjamin Caguioa.,Of the 9, four are appointees of President Benigno Aquino III: Sereno, Leonen, Jardeleza, and Caguioa.,The 6 justices who voted against Poe are Antonio Carpio, Teresita Leonardo-de Castro, Mariano del Castillo, Arturo Brion, Estela Perlas-Bernabe, and Bienvenido Reyes.,Of the 6, two are appointes of Aquino: Bernabe and Reyes. Three of them \u2013 Carpio, Brion and De Castro \u2013 were part of the Senate Electoral Tribunal that earlier voted in favor of Poe. The 3 justices dissented in that SET verdict, insisting that Poe is not a natural-born citizen. (READ: ,Why did SC justices vote to disqualify Grace Poe?,), ,The verdict came after recent surveys showed Poe as the front runner in the presidential race. (READ: ,Duterte, Poe, Binay, Roxas and a dead heat race,) ,In a statement released hours after the verdict, SC spokesman Theodore Te said: \"I am authorized to say that there will be four concurring opinions to the Majority Decision, and five dissenting opinions. Please note that since the Court has only authorized the release of the vote, it may not be safe to report which ground the Court ruled upon and used as basis for the vote, i.e., between citizenship and residence. Thus, it may be best to simply say, the SC grants Senator Poe's petitions, 9-6, allowing her to run for the presidency.\",The High Court heard oral arguments on the case for 5 Tuesdays, ,from January 19 to February 16,. The SC justices interpellated Poe's counsel Alex Poblador, Comelec's lead counsel Arthur Lim, Solicitor General Florin Hilbay, and former University of the East Law Dean Amado Valdez.,  ,During the oral arguments, the views of at least 3 justices showed they were leaning toward recognizing Poe as a natural-born Filipino and as having established residency before running for president: Sereno, Leonen and Jardeleza.,Sereno and Leonen ,focused on the rights of foundlings,, while Jardeleza expressed his concern that the Comelec might have deprived Poe of her rights to due process.,3 bodies,Poe fought disqualification cases against her before 3 bodies: the SET, Comelec, and the SC.,It was a close vote at the SET. In November 2015, the ,SET voted 5-4 ,to deny the petition to disqualify Poe from the 2013 senatorial polls.,A month later, in December 2015, the ,Comelec en banc ,decided to dismiss Poe's appeal to allow her to run. ,The commissioners voted separately on the two cases involving the senator's citizenship and residency requirements: the one handled by the First Division and the other by the Second Division. Both divisions previously ruled against Poe. ,At the SC, the oral arguments showed that the justices were split on at least least 4 key issues on the case.

Pada tanggal 10 Juni, Julia dipanggil ke pangkuan-Nya pukul 11:12 WIB di Rumah Sakit Cipto Mangunkusumo.,Perempuan yang akrab disapa Jupe itu mulai mengidap penyakit itu sejak tahun 2014. Dia yang biasa terlihat ceria dan penuh rasa percaya diri, sempat terbaring lemas di rumah sakit selama berbulan-bulan lamanya. Dari sahabat-sahabat artisnya hingga para politisi pun telah menyempatkan diri untuk menjenguk dan memberi dukungan kepada wanita kelahiran 15 Juli 1980 ini.,Tak banyak yang ingat sejak kapan Jupe mengidap penyakit yang dideritanya. Kami merangkum kisah perjalanan Julia Perez dalam menjalani penyakit kanker yang dideritanya.,September 2014,Pada bulan September 2014, Julia Perez mengkonfirmasi bahwa dirinya telah divonis mengidap kanker mulut rahim stadium 2. Ia mengaku hampir pingsan ketika mendengar vonis tersebut.,Sejak mengetahui vonis ini, Jupe sering pulang pergi Jakarta-Singapura untuk melakukan terapi dan beberapa prosedur pengobatan lainnya.,Mei 2015,Penyakit kanker yang diderita Jupe mulai menghilang, namun ia menemukan masalah lain. Dokter mendiagnosis dirinya menderita kista dan pada saat yang sama terdapat benjolan di payudaranya. Ia pun kembali bertolak ke Singapura untuk melakukan pengobatan.,November 2015,Julia Perez dinyatakan bersih dari kanker. Ia mengucapkan rasa syukurnya dengan cara menghibur para pasien kanker di Rumah Sakit Dharmais. Ia menuturkan bahwa dirinya akan mencoba melaksanakan pola hidup sehat dan mencari pasangan yang sehat pula. Jupe juga memberi saran kepada para pengidap kanker lainnya untuk percaya pada dokter dalam negri saja daripada harus jauh-jauh ke luar negeri untuk berobat seperti yang pernah ia lakukan.,April 2016,Setelah beberapa bulan dinyatakan bersih dari kanker, Julia Perez muncul dengan kepala plontos di sebuah acara hiburan. Ia menjelaskan bahwa menggunduli kepalanya bukan untuk membuat sensasi, melainkan untuk menunjukkan dukungan dan solidaritas kepada penderita kanker, khususnya kaum wanita.,Desember 2016,Penyakit kanker mulut rahim pun kembali menyerang Jupe.

Diduga keduanya adalah efek dari pengobatan radiasi untuk menghapus kanker yang pernah ia lakukan. Bukan hanya kemoterapi dan operasi tulang belakang, Jupe juga sudah melakukan operasi blok syaraf pada kaki, perut, dan juga lengannya.,Maret 2017,Keadaan Jupe pada akhir Maret 2017 sempat dinyatakan membaik meski harus tetap menjalani rawat inap di rumah sakit. Dirinya mulai bisa berlatih berjalan dan keluarganya pun optimis bahwa ia sebentar lagi bisa melakukan rawat jalan., ,April 2017,Kondisi Jupe mengalami penurunan. Tidak seperti biasanya dimana ia tetap terlihat ceria meskipun sedang menjalani perawatan, Jupe hanya terdiam dan menangis ketika dijenguk sahabatnya, ,Ruben Onsu,. Ruben pun menjelaskan kondisi mental Jupe yang mulai menurun yang ditandai oleh seringnya ia menangis karena tak kunjung sembuh.,Ruben juga menyatakan niatnya untuk melaksanakan galang dana demi membantu Jupe membayar tagihan rumah sakitnya. Ia mengaku telah berkoordinasi dengan keluarga dan para sahabat Jupe untuk meringankan beban sahabatnya ini.,Menggandeng Raffi Ahmad dan Eko Patrio, Ruben berencana membuat acara bincang-bincang selama satu jam di stasiun televisi swasta yang hasil penayangannya akan digunakan untuk membantu Jupe menyelesaikan pembiayaan pengobatannya.,Juni 2017,Jupe akhirnya menghembuskan nafas terakhirnya di RS Cipto Mangunkusumo pukul 11:12 WIB. Padahal, sebelumnya kondisi Jupe sudah sempat membaik. ,Informasi meninggalnya Jupe disampaikan oleh adiknya Nia Anggia melalui akun Instagram. ,Duka pun langsung menyelimuti para selebriti, khususnya yang mengenal dekat sosok Jupe. Menurut asisten Jupe Markoneng, jasadnya akan dibawa ke rumah duka di kawasan Cibubur dan dimakamkan pada Sabtu, 10 Juni di TPU Pondok Ranggon. ,-Rappler.com,BACA JUGA:", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/gaya-hidup/166851-perjalanan-julia-perez-melawan-kanker-mulut-rahim", "title": "Perjalanan Julia Perez melawan kanker mulut rahim", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/the-wrap/166527-berita-selebriti-senin-10-april-2017"},

The Court of Appeals will hear on March 30 and 31 oral arguments on Makati Mayor Junjun Binay\u2019s motion questioning the legality of the preventive suspension issued by the Ombudsman against him. ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 The appellate court on Monday, March 16, temporarily stopped the preventive suspension issued by the Ombudsman against of Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay.,The Court of Appeals Sixth Division issued a 60-day temporary restraining order (TRO) on the implementation of Binay's suspension, the order for which was served by the Department of the Interior and Local Goverment (DILG) just a few hours earlier.,Despite being ,suspended Monday morning, and his ,vice mayor being sworn in as acting mayor,, Binay said he would continue to discharge his duties because he continued to question the legality of the suspension order. He said he would wait for the Court of Appeal's decision on his motion.,The 6-month suspension order stems from complaints over a P11.97-million Makati contract covering the design and architectural services of a car park building. No public bidding, as required by law, was allegedly conducted.,In his 25-page petition for certiorari, Binay asked the appellate court to issue a TRO on the implementation of the 6-month preventive suspension order. Named respondents are Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales and the DILG, which is tasked to implement the suspension order.,In his petition with the CA, Binay said the Office of the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion when it ordered his preventive suspension even if the evidence of guilt against him is not strong. For that, the Ombudsman violated Section 24 of Republic Act 6770 (the Ombudsman Act) and Administrative Order Number 07 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman).,The Ombudsman told Rappler, however, that the ,evidence of Binay\u2019s guilt was strong,.,Serious issues raised,In its 5-page resolution, the CA ,resolved to grant the TRO sought by the Binay camp \"in view of the seriousness of the issues raised in the Petition for Certiorari and the possible repercussions on the electorate who will unquestionably be affected by suspension of their elective official.\",The resolution was signed by Associate Justice Jose Reyes Jr. Concurring are associate justices Francisco Acosta and Eduardo Peralta Jr.,In its resolution, the CA cited the Supreme Court (SC) ruling on ,Garcia v. Court of Appeals,.,In that ruling, the SC held that the suspension of an elective official \"will undeservedly deprive the electorate of the services of the person they have conscientiously chosen and voted into office.\",JUBILANT.

{"content": "\nAnd what's the basis of the majority in upholding Poe's status as a natural-born Filipino? \n,REASONS BEHIND THE VOTES. Here is a breakdown of how the members of the Senate Electoral Tribunal voted in Senator Grace Poe's disqualification case. ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 After the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) voted 5-4 to ,dismiss the disqualification case against Grace Poe,, critics were concerned that the majority \u2013 all of them senators \u2013 voted based on politics and not based on Philippine laws.,The main question in Poe's citizenship issue is if the senator, who is now eyeing the presidency in the 2016 elections, is a natural-born Filipino. (READ: ,After close call at SET, emotional Grace Poe turns to prayer,),Her accuser, Rizalito David, argued that since she is a foundling, there is a possibility that she is ,not a natural-born citizen,. Only natural-born citizens can be elected as president, vice president, senator, and congressman, according to the Constitution.,Poe's camp has insisted that foundlings are considered natural-born citizens under applicable international laws, including treaties and generally accepted principles of international law. ,The tribunal eventually ruled in favor of Poe, although the decision is not yet final:,\"We rule that Respondent is a natural-born citizen under the 1935 Constitution and continue to be a natural-born citizen as defined under the 1987 Constitution, as she is a 'citizen of the Philippines from birth, without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect [her] Philippine citizenship,\" ,the SET's main decision read.,All 3 Supreme Court justices sitting on the SET voted to disqualify her.,The majority in the tribunal said Poe, who was naturalized as a citizen of the United States in 2001, also validly reacquired her natural-born Filipino citizenship after taking her Oath of Allegiance to the Philippines in 2006.,She renounced her US citizenship in 2010 as required by Republic Act (RA) 9225 or the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003.,The voting was a close call that ,divided the lawmakers from those in the judiciary,.,What was the basis of the majority in upholding Poe's status as a natural-born Filipino, and why did all the Supreme Court justices vote to disqualify her? (DOCUMENT: ,SET decision on disqualification case vs Grace Poe,),As of Sunday, November 22, only 7 members of the tribunal have submitted their separate opinions to the SET. Senator Nancy Binay did not submit an opinion, while ,Senator Pia Cayetano's opinion, is not yet available on the SET website. (DOCUMENTS: ,SET members' opinions on Poe case,),Rappler looks at the separate opinions of every SET member. Here are their main arguments:,IN FAVOR OF POE. (From left to right) Senators Pia Cayetano, Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, Cynthia Villar, Loren Legarda, and Vicente Sotto III all voted in favor of Poe. ,Senators Paolo Benigno Aquino IV and Cynthia Villar said it was not the intention of the framers of the 1935 Constitution to \"exclude\" and \"discriminate against\" foundlings when it comes to a natural-born citizenship.,\"As correctly pointed out by the majority, there was a recognition that children or people born in a country of unknown parents are citizen of this nation and the only reason that there was no specific reference to foundlings in the 1935 Constitution was that foundlings are few and far in between so that it is not necessary to include a provision on the subject exclusively,\" Aquino said in his separate opinion. Villar also argued the same.,Two senators also cited social justice in Poe's case. Aquino said the State itself, as dictated by social justice, should be the first to recognize and ensure that foundlings like Poe \"are able to enjoy each and every right accorded to them.\" (READ: ,Grace Poe's fight shows state of foundlings in PH \u2013 lawyer,),\"There lies a presumption that for those who have less in life, we should afford them the most basic right. Logic dictates that foundlings are not naturalized nor stateless but natural-born citizen of the Philippines,\" he added.,On the rights of a child to a nationality, Aquino cited the same international conventions used by Poe's camp: the Convention of the Rights of the Children (CRC) and the Hague Convention of 1930. Of the two, the Philippines is signatory only to the CRC.,Senator Vicente Sotto III, meanwhile, said even a foundling \u2013 \"the abandoned child on our doorstep\" \u2013 is also \"the least of our brethren.\",\"In any case, it is not the fault of foundlings that their parents abandoned them. The principle of social justice applies in cases of this nature,\" he added.,Sotto and fellow senator Loren Legarda argued that the citizenship issue against Poe only came up when she began leading the presidential surveys.,Still, they believe the electorate should be taken into consideration in Poe's case, especially since \"the composition of the SET] is predominantly political,\" with 6 senators in the tribunal outnumbering the 3 justices.,\"The Philippine Constitution did not demand a strictly legal viewpoint in deciding disqualification cases against senators\u2026. The fact that six Senators, elected by the whole country, form part of the Senate Electoral Tribunal would suggest that the judgment of the whole Filipino nation must be taken into consideration also,\" Sotto said.,Legarda, meanwhile, cited a 1996 case \u2013 ,Frivaldo vs Commission on Elections and Raul Lee \u2013, which she thinks is applicable also in Poe's case.,She said the major lesson from the 1996 case is when there is doubt in interpreting constitutional and legal provisions involving popular sovereignty, it is best to interpret \"in a manner that enables our electorate to elect freely their chosen leader.\",\"I believe that by denying Senator Poe's natural-born citizenship, we would be reversing the will of over 20 million votes. And in the process, we would also be effectively denying our entire electorate the opportunity to select their President freely and democratically,\" she added.,For Aquino and Villar, David as petitioner failed to present proof that Poe is not a natural-born Filipino.,\"Anybody who claims that she is not a natural-born citizen of the Philippines must establish that fact with adequate proof and not merely rely on her being a foundling,\" Villar said.,Until David presents evidence that Poe's parents are not Filipino, Aquino said the presumption of regularity should prevail.,AGAINST POE. (From left to right) Senior Justice Antonio Carpio, Associate Justices Teresita Leonardo-de Castro and\nAssociate Justice Arturo Brion, and Senator Nancy Binay all voted against Poe. ,SET chair and Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, in his separate opinion, argued that no law automatically grants citizenship to foundlings born in the Philippines.,\"Even if there were, such a law would only result in the foundling being a naturalized Filipino citizen, not a natural-born Filipino citizen,\" Carpio said.,Under the 1935 Constitution (the charter that was in effect when Poe was born), ,Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro, said Poe's camp cannot argue natural-born citizenship at birth by virtue of a disputable presumption because this will mean an inferior status for children whose mothers are citizens of the Philippines. The child whose mother is a Philippine citizen can only choose for herself Philippine citizenship once she reaches the age of 21, based on the 1935 Constitution., ,Both de Castro and ,Associate Justice Arturo Brion, said there is nothing in the 1935 Constitution that grants citizenship to foundlings. Following this argument, then, they noted that Poe could not have reacquired natural-born citizenship under RA 9225.,Carpio said foundlings like Poe still have to prove his or her status as a foundling before they can acquire Philippine citizenship \u2013 as naturalized, not natural-born.,When it comes to qualifications for public office, De Castro said natural-born citizenship \"must be an established physical fact and not a possibility qualification which can later be proven true or untrue.\",Carpio and de Castro both believe that none of the conventions used by Poe to prove her natural-born status automatically grant Philippine citizenship to a foundling at birth.,To begin with, Carpio noted that the Philippines only acceded or ratified 3 of the 5 international conventions: the CRC, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights,De Castro said these conventions will only apply for a State by way of a national law or a legislative enactment, and even then, the nature of the citizenship is by naturalization.,\"There must be a law by which citizenship can be acquired. By no means can this citizenship be considered that of a natural-born character under the principle of ,jus sanguinis, in the Philippine Constitution.\",Brion agreed: \"The Philippines' treaty obligations do not grant Philippine citizenship outright to foundlings. These obligations simply require the country to recognize a foundling's right to acquire Philippines citizenship.\",De Castro also said Poe \"cannot seek refuge\" under provisions of an international convention \"which runs counter to the provision of the Constitution\u201d when determining the citizenship of a person, that is, following jus sanguinis or \"by blood.\",De Castro said that even if Poe topped the 2013 senatorial elections, her \"election victory\" cannot be \"used as a magic formula to bypass eligibility requirements.\",\"This Tribunal is very much aware that the respondent was voted into office by an overwhelming number of votes, close to 20 million. However, it is settled doctrine in jurisprudence that an election victory cannot override constitutional and statutory provisions on the qualifications and disqualifications of elected officials,\" she noted.,Carpio also refused to rule based only on \"sentimental plea\" which he thinks \"conveniently forgets\" that the Constitution reserves national posts such as a senatorial seat \"exclusively to natural-born Filipino citizens\" \u2013 a provision which he said must be complied with strictly.,After all, he said the members of the tribunal were sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution by applying its \"clear letter and intent.\",\"Pointing to the purportedly sad plight of foundlings if found not to be natural-born Filipino citizens, particularly their disqualification from being elected to high public office and appointed to high government positions, appeals plainly to human emotions,\" Carpio said.,For Carpio, Poe failed to discharge her burden to prove that she is a natural-born Filipino. This runs counter to what Poe's camp believes: that the burden of proof is on the petitioner.,\"There is no legal presumption in favor of Philippine citizenship, whether natural-born or naturalized. Citizenship must be established as a matter of fact and any doubt is resolved against the person claiming Philippine citizenship,\" he said.,He, however, reiterated what was mentioned during the oral arguments: that any decision based on the absence of proof of blood relation \"never becomes final.\",Even SET's decision is not yet final. David's camp filed a ,motion for reconsideration, on Monday, November 23.

President Rodrigo Duterte signs the P3.35-trillion 2017 budget on December 22, 2016. File photo by Presidential Photo  ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday, December 22, signed into law Republic Act 10924 or the 2017 General Appropriations Act (GAA) amounting to P3.35 trillion, the first under his administration.,The 2017 GAA is 11.6% higher than the 2016 budget and represents 21% of the projected gross domestic product (GDP) for 2017. It is the highest proposed by any administration so far. (READ: ,2017 budget priorities: Infrastructure, agriculture, peace and order,),The President thanked lawmakers as well as the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) headed by Secretary Benjamin Diokno for a budget that is \"pro-people, pro-investment, pro-growth, and pro-development.\",In his speech, Duterte said the budget will benefit \"the poor, the vulnerable, and those in the countryside.\",It is a budget for \"real change,\" one that \"represents the bold plans of the Duterte administration,\" the DBM said in a statement.,Biggest pie for education,The Department of Education (DepEd) received the highest allocation for 2017 with P544.1 billion, a significant increase from 2016's P433 billion. This will be used to maintain basic education facilities, create teaching and non-teaching positions as well as develop and provide learning resources to more than 20 million Filipino students\u00ad in the country, the DBM said.,\"Deserving Filipinos will be given access to tertiary education through the P58.72-billion allocation for state universities and colleges (SUCs) and the P18.7-billion allocation for the Commission on Higher Education (CHED),\" the department added.,The 2017 budget also increased allocation for infrastructure, ,free education for SUCs,, universal healthcare, and ,free irrigation for farmers,, among others.,Duterte said farmers will no longer have to pay irrigation fees, because these will be shouldered by the National Irrigation Authority which was granted P38.4 billion for 2017.,The Department of Agriculture (DA) got P45.2 billion, while the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) received P9.8 billion.,Highest increase,Of all government agencies, it is the Office of the President (OP) that has the highest increase of funds of more than 600%. (READ: ,Confidential, intel funds difficult to audit \u2013 ex-COA chair,),The DBM earlier explained that the, P17-billion increase, includes funds for the 50th founding anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which the Philippines will host next year.,The OP also earlier said the budget is meant to cover \"increased requirements for intelligence information gathering and other surveillance activities.\",Infrastructure mixed with 'pork barrel'?,The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is given P53.3 billion, an increase of 25% compared to 2016 while the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) receives P454.7 billion, an 18.3% increase. ,On top of this, P850 billion was allotted for the construction of road networks and transport infrastructure to ease conduct of business and mobility of people.,This earned criticism from Senator Panfilo Lacson, who earlier criticized ,billions of alleged hidden pork barrel ,or lump sum funds in the DPWH budget.,Lacson questioned the seemingly repetitive \"feasibility studies\" and \"central office\" indicated in the DPWH budget. He also ,questioned the P8.3-billion funds, for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao which was included in the DPWH budget, saying this violates the ARMM Organic Law.,During the bicameral conference committee, the House eventually gave in to Lacson's proposal. In the end, the P8.3 billion was removed from the DPWH and transferred to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for ,free tuition ,in SUCs. CHED, however, has yet to iron out the details on what to do with the additional budget.,Lacson earlier challenged the President to veto \"pork-like\" funds in the 2017 budget to show he is serious in fighting corruption, one of his campaign promises. If not, the senator said he might question the budget before the Supreme Court. (READ: ,Lacson dares Duterte: Show political will, veto 'pork' in 2017 budget,) ,Doctors to the barrios, LGUs,An additional P1.5 billion has been allocated to the Department of Health\u2019s program, Doctors to the Barrios (DTTB), which makes the total funding for the agency P96.3 billion.,The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) was given P53.22 billion to fund universal health care for Filipinos.,\"The Duterte administration understands the significance of empowering local government units (LGUs),\" the DBM said. \"Thus, aside from close to half-trillion (P486.9 billion) Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), local governments are provided with additional transfers such as the Local Government Support Fund.\",The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) will get a P148.0 billion budget to help the country's campaign against illegal drugs, construct new jail facilities, and increase the allowance for prisoners, according to the DBM.,The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) will receive P128.3 billion \u2013 P78.2 billion is allocated for the Conditional Cash Transfer program, which provides monthly financial assistance to some 4.4 million poor households.,Crime and security,The Philippine National Police, which leads the administration's war on drugs, got an increased budget of P110 billion from this year's P88 billion.,The Department of National Defense received funding of P137.2 billion for territorial defense, including additional subsidy for the repair of Veterans Center, an Expanded Veterans\u2019 Hospitalization Program, and the construction of new cadet barracks. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/156276-duterte-signs-2017-budget", "title": "Duterte signs P3.35-trillion 2017 budget into law", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/164159-senate-concurs-paris-climate-deal,http://www.rappler.com/nation/170593-senate-bill-telecommuting-work-from-home-final-reading,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/65232-deped-dost-scitech-scholarships,http://www.rappler.com/nation/155504-senate-ratifies-2017-budget-report,http://www.rappler.com/nation/143116-2017-proposed-budget-priorities,http://www.rappler.com/nation/155562-congress-2017-budget-ched-free-tuition-sucs"},

Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, one of the world's oldest shopping malls, features some of the biggest clothing brands. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler   ,We\u2019ve all seen it in movies and postcards \u2013 romantic Italy with its great wine, delicious food, breathtaking architecture, rich history, among others. There just seems to be nothing Italians do without great care and sophistication. ,It\u2019s just how things are in Italy, where people take great pride in their culture and their every craft.,Growing up thousands of miles away, I've dreamt of seeing it for myself. But then, as for a lot of other Filipinos, a trip all the way to Europe all seemed like a shot to the moon. ,I proved myself wrong this summer, however, when after months of preparations, I finally managed to visit my dream Italian cities, all for a meager budget of P60,000.,APARTMENT IN MILAN. Italians take great pride in their crafts. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler ,Let me share to you a one-week itinerary (flight time excluded) for 4 which I've tried and tested with my family. ,In this itinerary, you will be visiting at least 4 cities in northern Italy \u2013 Milan, Como, Verona, and Venice \u2013 with Milan as your entry and exit point. Feel free to alter it to suit your preference \u2013 I'd love to hear about your trip in the comments!,Getting a Schengen visa and plane tickets,Assuming that you already have a passport, the first thing you'll need to get is a Schengen visa. For starters, you may check out this Rappler ,guide in getting a Schengen visa,.,Just as in the guide, I got my visa through the VIA Center in Makati. It took around two weeks for me to get my visa approved., ,What you will need is a short-term visit permit which will require you to submit plenty of documents including an employment certificate, bank statement, and travel health insurance. ,Remember that you need to be able to give an impression that you have no reason to stay in Italy beyond 90 days, which means that you need to prove that you have the financial capability to stay in Italy and come back to the Philippines. I had to save up for months just to make sure I had plenty of money in my bank account.,In securing a visa, I've spent at least P6,000 (travel health insurance included).,One of the requirements for getting a visa are booked round-trip tickets from the Philippines to Italy. If you book early, you can get plane tickets from Manila to Milan and vice versa for as low as P30,000. I got mine through Oman Air at this rate.,Accommodations,For this itinerary, you will be staying only in Milan and traveling to other cities by day. There are plenty of accommodations all over Milan but it's best if you book early. My suggestion is that you find one which is a walking distance away from an underground train station.,For ,budget hotels,, you can find some for as low as 40 euros (P2,172 per night). But I suggest, especially if you're travelling in a group of 4, that you ,use AirBnb, instead where you can find a whole apartment for around the same price (just prepare extra money for the cleaning fee). ,WONDERS OF MILAN. If you follow this guide, you'll be staying mostly in Milan, Italy's fashion capital. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,Working on a 40 euros per apartment per night budget, each one of you will only need to shell out at least 80 euros (P4,346) for 8 nights, which already includes the night upon your arrival to Milan and the night before you leave., ,For food, you can save by buying breakfast or lunch from grocery stores. If you're staying in an apartment, they are usually equipped with a kitchen so you can at least heat up food. ,SWEET TOOTH. Italy is heaven for dessert lovers. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,But of course, you simply can\u2019t go on a trip to Italy without trying out good ol' Italian food. I usually ate lunch on the go, buying from food stalls as I walked around. ,Food from food stalls is quite heavy \u2013 for example, I was able to buy a big cone of Belgian fries, chicken, nuggets, and fish sticks for 8 euros (P434), and gourmet sandwiches for around 4 euros (P217) each.,HEAVY SNACK. This cone with Belgian fries, nuggets, fried chicken, and fish sticks cost only 8 euros. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler ,A single pasta dish costs around 8 to 12 euros (P651) and servings are usually big., ,ITALIAN FOOD. For good pasta and pizza, try Dogana near the Duomo in Milan. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,DELICIOUS PASTA. A whole plate of pasta marinara costs around 12 euros. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,Overall, each one of us spent around 120 euros (P6,517) for food.,Here is an overview of the itinerary:,Transportation,Now, before we go through your itinerary, you'll need to understand Milan's transportation system first., ,The good news is that Italy's transportation system is very convenient and easy to understand (at least compared to ours). ,To really save time and money, I suggest that you use the Metro \u2013 the underground subway system \u2013 as your main mode of transportation within Milan. Familiarize yourself with Milan's ,Metro map ,and make sure to know which stations are closest to your hotel/apartment and target destinations, ,There are maps and guides available at the airport and train stations and people are generally willing to help you out when you ask them. ,For either bus or Metro, a single journey ticket costs 1.50 euros. Each ticket is valid for 90 minutes (which means that you can ride as many trains/buses with one ticket 90 minutes after it was validated). To save, I suggest that you buy a 10-card which costs 13.80 euros (P749) and is good for 10 journeys. One of this is all you\u2019ll need for this itinerary.,Taxis in Europe are very expensive so avoid them as much as possible. If commuting intimidates you, a good alternative is to hire ,Filipinos' coaching services in Milan, whose rates are so much cheaper. You can arrange trips with them beforehand by contacting them online or you can also find them waiting for customers at the airport. , ,If you have the extra cash, you may also book them instead for long drives when you go to other Italian cities.,I suggest that before leaving for Milan, contact them and ask for a number just so you\u2019d have people to call in case you get lost., ,Milan \u2013 Day 0 to 1, ,The travel from Manila to Milan, including the stop, will take around 16 hours (hoping that it doesn't get delayed like what happened to mine). If you leave Manila by night like I did, it will also be evening already when you get to the airport in Malpensa. ,The airport is still quite far from the city center in Milan so you may take the train, get a cab, or hire a Filipino coach service.,The fastest option is to ride the train, Malpensa Express, which will take you to Piazza Cadorna or to the Central Station. Both are connected to other train lines so make sure to know which Metro station is nearest your hotel. This will cost each of you around 11 euros.,Again, do not take a cab. In my case, since we were already tired from the long trip, we availed of a Filipino coach service which cost 35 euros for a one way trip., ,After resting at your hotel/apartment in Milan, you\u2019re now ready to start your tour.,The cheapest and easiest way to tour Milan is through a ,sightseeing bus, (also known as a hop on hop off bus). These buses continuously go around tourist spots all over the city every day, and just as the name implies, you can hop on and off them anytime. The ticket for this bus would cost you around 19 euros per day, and the buses are already equipped with an audio guide.,MILAN TOUR. City sightseeing buses come with audio guides. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,You can buy a ticket at any bus so just ask your host/hotel for the nearest stop, .,There are different lines for these buses, all going to different sets of tourist spots in Milan. Line A for example will take you to Cadorna, Cenacolo, Sant Ambrogio, Parco Basiliche, Sforza, Duomo, Manzoni-Scala, and Manin., ,15TH CENTURY CASTLE. Kick off your tour with a trip to the Sforza Castle, a 15th-century castle in the middle of Milan. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,CASTLE GARDEN. This garden is found inside the Sforza Castle in Milan. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,I suggest that you spend some time in the Sforza Castle, a 15th-century castle now housing several museums and art collections.,There are plenty of food you can buy around tourist spots too like Belgian fries, gellatos, and sandwiches. Yum!,GOURMET SANDWICHES. Hungry? There are plenty of stalls selling gourmet sandwiches for as low as 4 euros each. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,Day 2 - Como,Now it\u2019s time to go to another Italian city!,On your second day, you can take the train from Milan to Como. (The train station is at Cadorna which you\u2019ll discover when you take the sightseeing bus). If you book early, ,a train ride, to Como would cost you only 5 euros each. The ride will take only 30 minutes to an hour., ,RELAXING TOUR. Como, Italy is a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,Como is a classic honeymoon destination in Italy \u2013 a lakeside city with a view of the Alps. ,Just a walk away from the train station, you can ride a cable train to Brunate, a small uphill town. For 5 euros, you get to ride the century old Como-Brunate funicular up and down the mountain.,UP YOU GO. To get to Brunate, you can take the Como-Brunate funicular. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler    ,CENTURY OLD. The Como\u2013Brunate funicular connects the city of Como with the village of Brunate and has been operating since 1894, used by both tourists and locals. ,Up above is a spectacular full view of Lake Como. You\u2019ll come across plenty of restaurants beside Lake Como but I suggest that you eat lunch at Brunate so you can also enjoy the view. While there, make sure to try out Lombardy's famous wine!,LUNCH WITH A VIEW. Get a great view of Lake Como from the small uphill town of Brunate. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,LOCAL WINE. Make sure to try out Lombardy's famous local wines. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,Most of the souvenirs you can find in Como are fine wooden products like wooden yoyos, keychains, and figurines, among others. They can be pretty expensive but there are some small items you can buy while on a budget.,WOODEN SOUVENIRS. Como is known for its wood crafts. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,BIG SERVINGS. Fair warning: Servings in Italian restaurants are usually big. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,There are lots to see in other parts of Como too. You can walk around the city, or if you have an extra budget, take a boat ride on Lake Como too (take a public ferry, not a private boat). You can find a price list ,here,. ,By 7pm, travel back to Milan via train.,Bonus tip: ,Switzerland is pretty close to Como already so if you have extra time, you can take a train to Bellinzona and check out its three castles or visit the Alprose Chocolate Museum in Caslano to know how Swiss chocolates are made.,SIDE TRIP. If you have the time, take a quick trip to Switzerland and check out the view from the top of Castelgrande. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,Day 3 - Milan (the last supper) and eating at Naviglio,For your 3rd day, you can visit and see for yourself \"The Last Supper,\" ,a late 15th-century mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie. If you rode the sightseeing bus on your first day, finding it should be easy.,To avoid lines, book your ticket online for as low as 12 euros., ,FOOD DISTRICT. You'll never run out of restaurant choices at Naviglio. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,For dinner, I suggest you go to buzzing Naviglio district \u2013 Milan's canal area (canals were made to transport materials used to build the Milan Cathedral) \u2013 which is now surrounded by a selection of bars and restaurants.,There are plenty of buffets in the area, too, where you can eat unlimited food for as low as 8 euros!,Day 4 - Verona,On your fourth day, visit the home of Shakespeare's famous ,Romeo and Juliet \u2013, Verona. ,COLORFUL VERONA. Pastel-colored houses make every Verona street Instagram-worthy. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler   ,Again, you can take a one-hour train ride to Verona from Milan for as low as 12.75 euros. ,I fell in love with Verona's pastel-colored houses. Just a walk around the city will get you enough Instagram-worthy photos for a day or two., ,It's also a city full of museums, so to fully enjoy your day, I suggest you visit some of them. , ,CASA DI GIULIETTA. Casa di Giulietta features the iconic balcony from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,A must-visit is Casa di Giulietta (Juliet's House) \u2013 a 1300s house and museum, with a stone balcony, inspired by Shakespeare',s play. ,LUCKY STATUE. People believe that touching this Juliet statue's breast brings good luck. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,But fair warning: the house's courtyard is usually packed with people. ,Entrance to the courtyard is free. There, you can take a photo with a statue of Juliet (whose breasts people touch because they believe doing so would help them find their soulmates), leave a love locket, or buy Romeo and Juliet-related souvenirs., ,FROM FICTION TO REAL LIFE. Although Romeo and Juliet's story is fiction, you can get a good idea of how Juliet's house would look like in real life by visiting Casa di Giulietta. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler   ,You can also pay 6 euros (P325) to get inside the museum and get a look at how Juliet\u2019s (although fictional) house would look like from the inside.,There are other Romeo-and-Juliet themed museums in Verona but if you\u2019re looking for something else, you can also try the Museo Lapidario Maffeiano which is a 1738 museum ,featuring a collection of ancient stone carvings and inscriptions., ,By 7 pm, travel back to Milan.,Day 5 - Shopping in Milan,Now, you can\u2019t go to Italy\u2019s fashion capital without shopping!,If you plan to shop, the best time to be in Milan is in January for the winter sale or July for the summer sale. And when Italian shops go sale, they mean big, big discounts. ,SHOPPING IN MILAN. Allot at least a whole day for shopping in Milan. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler   ,The best place to shop in Milan would be the area surrounding the Duomo. From top fashion brands to local products, you can find everything there.,One of the world\u2019s oldest shopping malls, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, is great for luxury shopping, featuring the biggest designer brands like Gucci and Valentino. While there, try to find the bull from the Turin coat of arms. Tradition says that spinning around 3 times with a heel on the testicles of the bull from the ,Turin, ,coat of arms, will bring good luck!, ,Other less expensive brands are there too, as well as local goods, so make sure to allot at least a day for shopping in this area.,For souvenirs, you can buy fancy chocolates like Lindt from the Galleria as well. Whole bars, assorted chocolates \u2013 you name it, they've got it. , ,PASALUBONG. Budget-friendly souvenirs? Try chocolates! Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,But if you\u2019re looking for cheaper sweets, try the ODS Store which is also just nearby.,WHAT TO BUY IN MILAN: ,Leather goods (bags, shoes, belts), designer clothes, chocolates, Italian coffee, wine,Day 6 - Venice,Your last Italian city is one of the country's most famous: Venice.,CANALS OF VENICE. There are no roads in Venice just canals lined with beautiful renaissance architecture. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,You may opt to stay longer here but I personally didn't want to because I found it overcrowded and more expensive than other cities. You can take a 3-hour train ride from Milan to Venice for around 20 euros (P1086)., ,Venice, a city ,built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea, is very a popular tourist destination and is often packed on peak seasons. ,PEAK SEASON.

A gondola ride in Venice costs 80 euros. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler   ,A cheaper alternative would be riding a water bus for 7.50 euros (P407) for a single journey. But I say ditch the water bus (which is almost always full anyway) and just walk if you don't mind walking. , ,WALKING TOUR. Ditch the bus and just walk around Venice! Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler ,The streets of Venice, as expected, are picture-perfect \u2013 a good mix of classic and new. You will notice that souvenirs and food are more expensive there, but if you\u2019re really looking for a fancy souvenir item, you'll be able to find Murano glass jewelries everywhere there. ,Murano glass is made on the Venetian island of Murano, whose glassmakers are considered as some of the best in the world.,ART SOUVENIRS. You can find paintings and other artworks being sold all over Italy. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,Another good buy when you're in Italy are artworks. You can find paintings being sold everywhere on the streets of Italy for as low as 15 euros (P814). ,Day 7 - Milan (rest and last minute shopping),For most of my trips, I always try to end it with a day for rest and last-minute chores. Ending it slow and easy like this helps make sure that everything's ready for your flight home (I hate panic packing). , ,It will also give you some time to rest after all the walking, so you look totally refreshed when you get back. , ,PICTURE-PERFECT. Every Italian city has its own style and personality and almost every street are picture-perfect. Photo by Don Kevin Hapal/Rappler  ,After packing, you can take another stroll around the Duomo or nearby grocery stores for some last minute shopping, too. For my last day, I sat down an Italian restaurant and concluded my tour with a good slice of pizza and a glass of wine. , ,Sample budget breakdown, ,Here\u2019s a sample breakdown expenses for your itinerary:,Overall, the total cost of an all-in trip would be around, P59,163, each.

At least, that\u2019s what ,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,wants us to believe. Amidst the melodramatic platitudes and cued teardrops, there\u2019s still an unmistakable amount of truth in the sentiment.,SHE'S DATING THE GANGSTER. All photos courtesy of Star Cinema , ,One of the greatest love stories, ,Romeo and Juliet, ,was a matter of timing. In the play\u2019s climactic end, seconds are all that separate tragedy from triumph. Had Juliet woken up seconds sooner, or had Romeo arrived seconds later, maybe Shakespeare\u2019s classic love story wouldn\u2019t have ended in tragedy.,In a way, ,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,is its own tragedy.  And like ,Romeo and Juliet, ,it\u2019s a tragedy that could\u2019ve been readily (though maybe not easily) avoided.,Based on ,the novel by Bianca Bernardino,, ,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,follows teenagers Athena (Kathryn Bernardo) and Kenji (Daniel Padilla), two students caught in a romantic clich\u00e9 as old as cinema.,DANIEL PADILLA. The actor plays both Kenji and Kenneth in the movie,Kenji recruits Athena to be his pseudo-girlfriend in an effort to spark jealousy in his former girlfriend Abby (Sofia Andres). But when Athena and Kenji\u2019s feelings cross the line from make-believe to reality, the conspiracy becomes predictably complicated.,But the new spin to the familiar formula is that the story is enframed by Kenneth and Kelay, two modern day teens searching for Kenneth\u2019s father. As we unravel the love story between Athena and Kenji, so do we bear witness to the love story of Kenneth and Kelay. The novelty here is that both couples are played by Bernardo and Padilla.,It\u2019s twice the love team with twice the story. But whether two of everything is better than one of anything is still a matter of debate.,But mostly, it\u2019s a matter of timing.,Kilig, and clich\u00e9s ,Despite its lofty romantic themes, ,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,still beats like a teenager\u2019s heart. Its characters are blinded by juvenile naivet,\u00e9, and are undeterred by the prospect of heartbreak. And though the film is crippled by an unbearable number of soap opera style twists, it at least delivers on its sugar-drenched romantic promise. (READ: ,She's Dating the Gangster ,earns P15 million on its first day,) ,\",Kilig much?\u201d ,Kelay asks the romantically pessimistic Kenneth. It\u2019s a question aimed right at even the hardest of hearts when, during a moment of temporary weakness, they might be so inclined to yell, \u201c,Yes! Yes! Kilig very much!\u201d,KATHRYN BERNARDO. The actress is one half of the love team popularly known as Kathniel, with Daniel Padilla,Whether it\u2019s mistakenly sent beeper messages or flirtatious rounds of billiards, ,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster, goes straight for the heart: the ,kilig, factor,. ,When left to her own devices, director Cathy Garcia-Molina shows why Bernardo and Padilla\u2019s reign as the country\u2019s premiere love team is a well-deserved title.,But unfortunately, ,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,doesn\u2019t escape the usual gauntlet of, teleserye,-inspired twists. A case of mistaken identity, an ugly-duckling make-over, an ominous heart condition and even a last minute bout of cancer all make an appearance in this clubhouse sandwich of mainstream cinema clich\u00e9s.,It\u2019s one unbelievable twist after another. But while it stands close to derailing the film from its initially lighthearted tracks, the film manages to stay on course thanks to its charming cast. , ,Missed opportunities,At first glance, the love story of Athena and Kenji is a typical girl meets boy tale marred by the usual romantic comedy clich\u00e9s. But as the story unfolds, it slowly becomes apparent that the film isn\u2019t content with delivering a cookie-cutter teen romance.,This isn\u2019t simply because of the film\u2019s predominantly \u201890s setting or non-traditional parallel narrative. Buried beneath the story\u2019s many melodramatic twists is a tale about second chances and missed opportunities.,\u201c,Kahit isang beses sa buhay mo, ayaw mo maging matapang?\u201d ,Kenji asks Athena. (For just once in your life, don\u2019t you want to be tough?),It\u2019s a question challenging the couple\u2019s supposedly fabricated relationship. But it\u2019s also an opportunity for the two to seize something real.,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,claims that we are helpless at the whims of time and love, and yet challenges its characters to seize it when they can. But when it comes right down to it, the ,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,doesn\u2019t follow its own advice.,Towards the film\u2019s climax, Kenji and Athena are forced to make a decision that inevitably alters the course of their relationship. The circumstances are as contrived as they are unbelievable, but regardless of their plausibility, it\u2019s also a chink in the film\u2019s romantic armor.,Without giving too much away, Kenji and Athena make the noble, arguably harder, decision. But while there is no mistaking the sacrifice of both Kenji and Athena, there is also an alarming sense of disappointment to their love story. They are each other\u2019s great love, Kelay so proudly proclaims to Kenneth. But how can any love be great when it\u2019s not held on and fought for with every fiber of your being and with any bone in your body?,That love isn\u2019t great. That love is an excuse., ,A greater love story,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,is clearly no work of Shakespeare, nor does it aspire to be. But while loose comparisons can be drawn between ,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster, and ,Romeo and Juliet,, the lovers in the latter at least stood for love until life itself was robbed from the young lovers\u2019 very lungs. But it turns out that Kenji and Athena are made of less hardy stuff. When challenged, their love bends, then folds, but ultimately breaks.,She\u2019s Dating the Gangster ,is a teen love story peppered with surprisingly mature themes. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s a love story that doesn\u2019t fight hard enough or dig deep enough. It\u2019s a film that is admittedly delightful, and satisfyingly charming, but it\u2019s also a film that doesn\u2019t challenge its material or its characters.,Love-struck audiences all over the country will undoubtedly wish for a love as great as Kenji and Athena's. But to that, one should say, ,No., ,Ask for something greater. Ask for something stronger. Ask for a love that doesn\u2019t bend to sickness, hardships or timing. Ask for a relationship that is stronger than Kenji and tougher than Athena. And fight for it to last. In no way are these easy demands to make of any relationship, but a love is only as great as the circumstances through which it survives.,A few fleeting months are not worth a lifetime of regret, especially when you\u2019ve been given the opportunity to change it. If there\u2019s anything we should be taking away from both Kenji and Athena, it\u2019s that love really is all about timing.

That her status as a natural-born Filipino is being questioned, she had said, was a form of discrimination against all foundlings like her.,But she carried on with her activities for the day. In a consultation with residents, the presidential candidate and her running mate Senator Francis Escudero even talked about pressing issues in the country such as education, agriculture, and social services.,BUSINESS AS USUAL. Senator Grace Poe talks to a crowd of students, teachers, and supporters at the common grounds of the University of Perpetual Help-Bi\u00f1an during a public consultation held on Tuesday afternoon. Photo from the Office of Senator Grace Poe   ,In a Facebook post, Poe's chief for political affairs Gary Jimenez said the presidential aspirant was on her way to the Bi\u00f1an campus of the University of Perpetual Help System when she learned of the SET decision: 5 senators out of the 9-member tribunal ,voted to deny the petition filed by her accuser Rizalito David.,Citing the rights of the adopted child, the majority voted that Poe, as a foundling, is a natural-born Filipino. ,Of the senator members, only Nancy Binay concurred with the 3 Supreme Court justices on the panel who voted to disqualify the senator.,\",Hinintay ko ang pagkakataong ito. Natanggap ko ang balita at nasabi na rin sa inyo na aprubado po tayo. Dineklara ng SET na hindi po tayo disqualified. Alam 'nyo po, hindi ko po makakalimutan itong University of Perpetual Help sapagkat dito ko nalaman ang magandang balita na iyan,,\" Poe told those gathered at the university on Tuesday.,(I've been waiting for this moment to come. I just received the news, and you were already informed, that we won. The SET declared that I am not disqualified. You know, I will not forget the University of Perpetual Help because it was here where I learned of that good news.),So happy was the senator, Jimenez said, that, right after the meeting, she looked for a chapel in the university to pray. The nearest one was \"more than a soccer field away,\" but this did not deter Poe.,\"The next thing that transpired did not really surprise us any more. She took off and ran almost the entire length of the field even as young children then playing in the grass saw her and shouted: 'Grace Poe! Grace Poe!'\" Jimenez said in his Facebook post. ,It was a decision worth celebrating, but the case is far from over.,The SET's decision is not yet a final one, and the camp of petitioner David plans to file a motion for reconsideration on Monday, November 23.,The tribunal will have to convene again to decide on the case with finality, hopefully before the printing of ballots in December.,The final decision is expected to have a bearing on a separate case filed by David before the Commission on Elections (Comelec).,There, David alleged that Poe committed an election offense when she \"falsely claimed\" she is a natural-born Filipino and had met the residency requirement when she ran for the Senate in the 2013 elections.,The Comelec case has already been, submitted for resolution.,It will also have an impact on Poe's presidential bid in the 2016 elections. To date, the presidential poll front runner is facing ,4 disqualification cases before the Comelec,, with 3 of the petitioners questioning Poe's natural-born status.,The other case questions her qualification for president based on the minimum residency requirement that she allegedly didn't meet. It is an issue that the case decided by the SET did not tackle.,The Constitution of the Philippines requires that those elected as president, vice president, senator, and congressmen be natural-born citizens. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

A file photo of both sides at the resumption of the peace talks between the government and the NDF in August 2016 in Oslo. Photo courtesy of OPAPP,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) on Friday, December 2, gave the Duterte administration until January next year to fulfill its promise to release all 432 political prisoners or risk rebel attacks.,Reacting to Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III\u2019s announcement of a plan to 50 political prisoners by the end of December, the CPP reminded the government of the \u201cexpectation\u201d it raised in August, when both sides ,reopened formal talks ,in Oslo. The CPP is represented by its political arm, the National Democratic Front (NDF), in the peace process. ,\"The planned release of a mere 40-50 political prisoners is an unacceptable token,\" the CPP said in a statement.,According to the party, the release of all 432 political prisoners should have happened on the last week of October.  This didn\u2019t happen, the CPP said, adding that even the release on humanitarian grounds was \u201cbeing delayed.\u201d,The guerrillas cited the death last Monday, November 28, of peasant activist Bernie Ocasla from Eastern Visayas.,\u201cJustice demands that all 432 remaining political prisoners be released immediately,\" the CPP said. \"Every additional second that political prisoners remain incarcerated add to the grave injustices which they have been made to suffer throughout the years in jail.\",On Friday, President Rodrigo ,Duterte granted pardon to 4 convicted rebels,, all consultants of the NDF. Bello said this moves the peace process forward.,Ceasefire at risk,The guerrillas said they were \u201cextending their patience and giving the Duterte regime up to the month of January to comply with its obligation to release all political prisoners.\u201d,Otherwise, the rebels said they will have no reason to sign a bilateral ceasefire agreement with the government. Worse, this could end the current interim ceasefire that the guerrillas had agreed to implement as a sign of good faith in the process, the CPP said. (READ: ,CPP to declare indefinite ceasefire \u2013 Joma Sison,),This is the strongest statement that the rebels have issued so far in relation to the peace process. ,Both parties have been hopeful that the talks would result in a bilateral ceasefire agreement before the end of the year. The first round of talks in August even tackled the prospect of granting amnesty to all political prisoners. (READ: ,Amnesty for NDF's prisoners, detainees,),The Duterte government has so far released ,at least 20 political prisoners,, including alleged New People\u2019s Army chief Benito Tiamzon, so they could participate in the talks.,But the release of the rest is taking \u201cway too long,\u201d the party said. \"Worse, surveillance, harassments and arrests against activists persist.\",The communists are allied with the Duterte administration, with Leftist leaders associated with them getting key Cabinet positions. ,The political alliance, however. has put the rebels in a difficult situation in the face of extrajudicial killings allegedly perpetrated by the police and Duterte's stand favoring the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.

{"content": "\nNew factors \u2013 a reputable Ombudsman and a whistleblower \u2013 can\u2019t get her away from graft cases \n,MORE TROUBLE AHEAD? Elenita Binay arrives at the 3rd division of the Sandiganbayan to post bail over new graft and malversation raps filed against her. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Elenita Binay has not been as lucky as her husband, Jejomar, in fending off graft and malversation charges. Way past her term as Makati mayor (1998-2001), she continues to face 7 cases before the Sandiganbayan.,Compare this to zero for Jejomar who ruled the premier city for a much longer period, close to 20 years. All 5 cases against Jejomar were either withdrawn by the Office of the Ombudsman or dismissed by the anti-graft court.,In an earlier report, we reviewed these cases and found that ,feeble prosecution coupled with bribes, to the lead prosecutor kept Jejomar unscathed from the 1980s till 2010.,Elenita, however, is navigating new territory. While the charges filed against her are old, similar to those that hounded her husband \u2013 rigged bidding, excess purchases and overpricing of supplies \u2013 the environment she finds herself in is new.,Two factors are working against her: the current team at the Office of the Ombudsman, known for their determined effort to curb corruption, and the emergence of a whistleblower, ,Ernesto Aspillaga,, one of her co-accused. Aspillaga is former head of the general services department of Makati City Hall.,7 cases,Three of the cases cover repeated public bidding of office furniture and partitions for the New Makati City Hall building which were found by the Commission on Audit (COA) to be sham biddings. Total cost of the fraud to the city of Makati was a whopping P107 million.,The remaining 4 stemmed from COA\u2019s findings on exorbitant prices of equipment for the Ospital ng Makati. The city entered into a negotiated contract with a company, ,Apollo Medical Equipment,, that claimed to be the exclusive distributor of a certain brand of hospital bed, bedside cabinet, Intensive Care Unit bed, orthopedic bed and sterilizers. It turned out that Apollo\u2019s documents were \u201cspurious\u201d and apparently was an excuse not to conduct public bidding.,How much did all these purchases \u2013 102 hospital beds, 202 bedside cabinets, 10 ICU beds, 4 orthopedic beds, 5 sterilizers \u2013 cost Makati taxpayers? P45.2 million. COA\u2019s ,Heidi Mendoza,, who led the special audit, testified in the Sandiganbayan and Senate on these overpriced purchases.,The Sandiganbayan cases against Jejomar show that Elenita appeared to have simply taken off from where her husband had left. By the time Elenita ran Makati, her husband had ruled it for 11 years, presiding over these dubious practices. Elenita just warmed the mayor\u2019s seat and handed it over to her spouse who, once again, enjoyed an untrammelled hold over the city for another 9 years.,Revived cases,Under the watch of Conchita Carpio Morales, cases on the overpriced Ospital ng Makati equipment were revived, this time including Elenita among the accused. These were filed with the Sandiganbayan in August 2013 and January 2014.,Elenita got a reprieve during the short period that Orlando Casimiro (former overall deputy ombudsman) was acting Ombudsman. (He assumed the post after Merceditas Gutierrez, faced with an impeachment trial, resigned.) One of his first acts after Gutierrez left on May 6, 2011 was to approve the filing of charges against the other Makati officials, except Elenita, for lack of evidence.,Casimiro sided with Elenita on the ground that a public officer cannot be faulted for an offense if he/she merely relied on good faith on his/her assistants. This argument arose from a Supreme Court case, ,Arias v. Sandiganbayan,, which decided in favor of a public works official, and which has since been known as the Arias doctrine.,The resolution approved by Casimiro, which was later overturned by Carpio-Morales, argued:,      As the final approving authority\u2026respondent Binay is within the scope of the Arias doctrine, the evidence showing that she had relied in good faith on the representations of respondent Aspillaga, as the City General Services Officer, and of respondent Santiago, as City Administrator, that the transaction was regular on its face.,      \u2026there is no showing that respondent Binay either acted in conspiracy or is outside of the coverage of the Arias doctrine. A painstaking review of the evidence reveals that respondents Santiago and [Dr Mabel] Asunio [chair, Ospital ng Makati obstetrics department] had crafted the Purchase Requests and Orders so well that there was nothing before respondent Binay that would have behoved her to examine the purchase further. ,Lawyers we spoke to say that public officials like to use the Arias case as a shield but it was decided based on peculiar circumstances and cannot apply to graft cases with different sets of facts.,Elenita Binay: custodian of funds,Others who were accused in the Ospital ng Makati case, led by the city administrator, Nicanor Santiago, and Aspillaga argued uniformly in their motions for reconsideration (MR) with the Sandiganbayan that the findings of graft and malversation were \u201cutterly baseless.\u201d,Santiago and Aspillaga said they were not the custodians of the funds; it was the approving authority, Mayor Elenita Binay, who was also chair of the committee on awards. \u201cIf the actual custodian of the public funds allegedly malversed is not being charged for malversation, no one else could be charged with the offense,\u201d the two officials said.,(Aspillaga would later testify in the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee about ,rigged bids in Makati,.) ,The MRs filed by the rest of the co-accused opened the door for a review of the entire case by the new Ombudsman, leading to the inclusion of Elenita. The special prosecutor assigned to the case found the Arias doctrine to be inapplicable: \u201cIt is undeniable that Binay extensively participated in the most decisive parts of the procurement process and in the eventual disbursement of funds\u2026she cannot disclaim responsibility and liability\u2026Good faith is a matter of defense that should be determined in the course of trial.\u201d,Lawyers of Elenita from the Yorac Arroyo Chua Caeda and Coronel firm assailed the Ombudsman for resurrecting these cases, saying these had already been dismissed and were \u201cfinal and executory.\u201d They also cited violations of their client\u2019s right to due process.     ,Whistleblower Aspillaga,The other factor that is making life difficult for Elenita is the emergence of whistleblowers, including Aspillaga, her co-accused in the Ospital ng Makati case. His testimony before the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee and addition information he may provide can bolster the prosecution.,Aspillaga was also charged, together with Elenita, in the cases of rigged bidding of office furniture. He is now under the witness protection program of the justice department. Some lawyers we spoke to say he could be a state witness.,It has been 8 years (2006) since this first set of cases was filed versus Elenita. They remain unresolved to this day.,We requested records of these cases with the various clerks of court in the Sandiganbayan where these are pending but they all had the same reply: the documents are with the justices. At the records section, when asked about the status of these cases, all they could say was these were pending and they identified the handling divisions.,Will the Sandiganbayan move faster this time? With an opaque case tracking system, it is hard to say. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/74617-no-easy-ride-elenita-binay-makati", "title": "No easy ride for Elenita Binay", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/nation/139042-robredo-federalism-questions,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/72733-payoffs-weak-prosecution-binay,http://www.rappler.com/nation/70140-rigged-bids-makati-binay"},

(READ: ,TIMELINE: Grace Poe's citizenship, residency,),Garcia said at least 4 pieces of evidence in their counter-affidavit prove Poe is a natural-born Filipino:,SET decision,Garcia again called on the Comelec to suspend proceedings first while the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) has yet to decide on a separate disqualification case against Poe.,\",Yung nasa Comelec law department ay dapat sana with all due respect ay masuspend muna ang proceedings, huminto muna po sila, sapagka't meron po kasing may kaso sa Senate Electoral Tribunal,,\" he said.,(With all due respect, the proceedings in the Comelec law department should first be suspended because there is still a case pending before the Senate Electoral Tribunal.),At present, both camps are also ,awaiting the decision of the SET, on the disqualification case filed against Poe, who is eyeing the presidency in the 2016 elections.,The SET is expected to make known its decision on November 17.,\",Paano kung sabihin ng Senate Electoral Tribunal na natural-born Filipino citizen si Senator Grace Poe? Eh 'di automatic, dismissed ang case na nandito sa Comelec law department. Ibig sabihin walang pagsisinungaling na ginawa,,\" Garcia explained.,(What if the Senate Electoral Tribunal declares Senator Grace Poe to be a natural-born Filipino citizen? Then it's automatic, this case at the Comelec law department will be dismissed. It means no lying was committed.),But even if the 9-member tribunal decides that Poe is not a natural-born Filipino, Garcia said the senator still did not lie back in 2013 because there was no malice on her part.,\",Kasi hindi mo pa nga alam anong interpretasyon doon sa pagiging napulot mo eh. Walang intent, walang malisya, walang kasinungalingan yung sinabi mo dahil yun ang pagkakaalam niyo at pagkakaalam nating lahat, na ang isang napulot ay citizen ng bansa na ito,,\" he added.,(Because you did not know the interpretation of your citizenship as a foundling. There was no intent, no malice, no lies in what you said because that's what you know, and what everyone knows: that a foundling is a citizen of this country.),But Luna said the SET's decision will \"in no way\" have a controlling effect on the Comelec case. ,Poe is also facing ,4 disqualification cases, before the Comelec in relation to her presidential bid. Her camp has since filed for a motion to consolidate the cases.,David, meanwhile, is ,also running for president, under the ,Ang Kapatiran Party, \u2013 the same party that backed his senatorial bid in the 2013 midterm elections.,He lost that year, while Poe topped the senatorial race. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

The subcommittee hearing is the 6th in a series probing the alleged overpriced Makati building.,The Vice President and his son, incumbent Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay Jr, are facing plunder raps over the building., ,'Ghost bidders',Although the building sparked the Senate probe, resource persons \u2013 former city officials, political foes, and former Binay allies \u2013 have detailed tales of the Binays' alleged corruption in the city.,Prior to Aspillaga, an official from a construction contractor denied participating in the bid for the controversial building, contrary to documents from the city itself which were read out during the hearing.,\u201c,Ang totoo po, hindi ko po nakita ang binasa mo ngayon. Hindi ko po alam kung bakit kami nandiyan. Malinaw sa, records ,namin na hindi kami nag,-,participate, sa ,bidding,,\u201d J-Bros Chief Operation Officer Alejandro Tengco testified before the Senate panel.,(The truth is, I\u2019ve never seen the document you\u2019re reading now. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re there. It\u2019s clear in our records that we didn't participate in the bidding.) ,Tengco also denied placing a bid on another Makati project, the Makati Science High School Building. In the first place, Tengco said, J-Bros was not qualified to do so under the Procurement Law. ,Another businessman, Marcial Lichauco Jr, testified before the Senate panel on September 11 that he  found himself, stuck inside a Makati City building elevator, on his way to bid for the city's rescue and emergency equipment \u2013 which Hechanova had cited in an earlier hearing as alleged proof of the bid rigging in the city under then mayor Binay.,Hechanova had earlier testified that the businessman was intentionally trapped in the elevator on orders of the Vice President, to let his chosen firm bag the contract.,At the Thursday hearing, Hechanova conceded that J-Bros\u2019 signature in the documents may have been forged. Hechanova, who vice-chaired the city\u2019s BAC after Aspillaga, said this was the way things worked in Makati.,In the case of the controversial building, eventual bid-winner Hilmarc\u2019s Construction Corporation listed down their bid \u201ccompetitors.\u201d Hechanova allegedly then took care of the other two companies\u2019 bid requirements. ,Senator Alan Peter Cayetano raised the alarm over the resource persons\u2019 allegations.,\u201c,Ang nakagugulat sa akin dito, hindi na naisali sila, [J-Bros] (What\u2019s surprising to me here is not that J-Bros was included) but that COA (Commission on Audit) did not check,\u201d he said.,Why now? ,The Vice President\u2019s spokesman for political affairs Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla criticized Aspillaga.,\u201cThere were hundreds of bids conducted during the period cited by Mr Aspillaga yet he admitted he doesn\u2019t have a copy of a single note. Obviously these are \u2018imaginary notes,\u2019\u201d said Remulla in a statement, referring to the Binays' handwritten notes alleged by the former Makati official.,Remulla alleged that Aspillaga was only after the immunity granted under the Witness Protection Program (WPP). \u201cWhy did he not reveal the existence of those 'notes' when he was being investigated by the Ombudsman for the same biddings he mentioned in his testimony, for which he is now facing several cases before the courts?\u201d Remulla asked.,Senator Antonio Trillanes IV moved that the subcommittee recommend that Aspillaga  be placed under the WPP, which the latter thanked the senator for.,Senator Aquilino Pimentel III, who chairs the subcommittee, said Aspillaga\u2019s admission to the WPP would be the Justice Department\u2019s discretion. Aspillaga, after all, has pending cases. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/70140-rigged-bids-makati-binay", "title": "Former official: Rigged bids in Makati under VP Binay, wife", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/nation/68156-fixing-bids-makati-city,http://www.rappler.com/nation/68791-businessman-trapped-elevator-makati-building"},

It held oral arguments on ,August 31, and ,September 8,. ,On August 23, just before the first day of the oral arguments, the SC issued a ,status quo ante order, (SQAO) on the interment of the former president.

Lagman asked that SC justices consider reissuing another status quo ante order on Marcos\u2019 burial until they are able to submit their motion.,Lagman also asked the High Court to advise the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the defense department to hold implementation of President Duterte's order to begin preparations for the Marcos burial until the SC ruling becomes final.,Marcos\u2019 body was ,interred, at the Libingan ng mga Bayani after being flown from Ilocos Norte.

The Senate Electoral Tribunal votes in favor of Senator Grace Poe in the disqualification case filed against her by defeated senatorial candidate Rizalito David. File photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines (5th UPDATE) \u2013 The Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) voted on Tuesday, November 17, to deny the petition to disqualify Senator Grace Poe from the 2013 polls, which was filed on the premise that she is not a ,natural-born Filipino.,The tribunal, composed of ,3 Supreme Court (SC) justices, and 6 senators, voted 5-4 in favor of Poe against petitioner Rizalito David.,The senator, in a statement, thanked the tribunal for its \"fairness,\" and her \"fellow Filipinos for their continued trust and confidence.\",The SET's decision is expected to have a bearing on some of the cases filed separately by David and other lawyers to also disqualify her from the 2016 presidential race.,The petitions, filed with the Commission on Elections, raise different issues against Poe. One of the arguments is that since her biological parents are not known, there is a possibility that she is not a natural-born Filipino, and therefore not qualified to seek the presidency.,SET sources said the Comelec may follow the SET decision on the citizenship issue, but not ,on the 10-year residency requirement for presidential candidates, which was not at issue in the SET case.,Petitioner David also has the option to appeal the SET decision before the Supreme Court, where Poe will need 7 votes for the favorable decision to be upheld. ,In a text message from the SET meeting inside the Manila Polo Club, Senator Vicente Sotto III told reporters that 5 senators v,oted to recognize the rights of an adopted child and to uphold Poe's status as a natural-born Filipino:,The rest voted to disqualify Poe: ,The vote was also confirmed by senators Villar and Legarda.,David \u2013 a losing 2013 senatorial candidate now seeking the presidency in the 2016 elections \u2013 alleged that since Poe is a foundling, there is a possibility she is not a natural-born Filipino and should have been disqualified as senator.,The Constitution of the Philippines requires that those elected as president, vice president, senator, and congressmen be natural-born citizens. Candidates for local posts can be naturalized citizens.,Poe's camp has stressed time and again the importance of the SET decision on this disqualification case and its implication on the ,status of foundlings in the Philippines,.,It also impacts on Poe's presidential bid in the 2016 elections. To date, the presidential poll frontrunner is already facing 4 disqualification cases, before the Comelec.,David's lawyer Manuelito Luna earlier said the losing camp in the SET disqualification case can still file a petition for certiorari before the SC.,\"Because of the Lerias doctrine, which position the justices took will be crucial for a reversal by the SC. That's what we should look at,\" Luna said in a text message to reporters. ,He was referring to the case of ,Lerias vs Mercado,, in which the SC warned politicians who are members of electoral tribunals to \"resolve each controversies with judicial, not political, integrity.\",Luna explained: \"The Lerias doctrine says that the members of the [House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal] should decide as judges as mandated by the Constitution, and not as politicians.\" ,Here is Poe's full statement on the SET decision: ,I thank the Senate Electoral Tribunal for their fairness. Their decision sends a strong message that the Philippines considers itself part of the global community that respects international law. More importantly, their affirmation of my natural-born status upholds the right of all foundlings in the country to the entitlements, services and protection they deserve as full citizens.,I thank our fellow Filipinos for their continued trust and confidence. Our work in the Senate will continue with the same, if not greater, fervor and commitment to the welfare of the Filipino people in all areas of the country.,Vice President Jejomar Binay, one of Poe's rivals in the presidential race, asked the public to \"respect the decision of the SET.\" His daughter Nancy was the only senator who voted with the justices to disaqualify Poe.,In a statement, his spokesman for political affairs Rico Quicho said: \"The SET has already decided on the matter.

Based on its synopsis, ,Water Lemon, seems to be of the same mold, with Lorca revisiting his hometown of Mauban to further examine rural truths underneath all the drama.,Kapatiran, ,Director:, Pepe Diokno,Synopsis:, In an elite law school fraternity, ironically, law is out of the question. ,Kapatiran, follows a week in the lives of a neophyte, a master, and a lawyer alumnus, and crosses the lines of money, power and connections within Manila\u2019s society. This all culminates on a Sunday, at the grand final initiation rites of the brotherhood.,Why you should get excited:, Pepe Diokno expands the cinematic lore on fraternities by focusing not on the hazing but on the personal and societal motivations of joining a fraternity.,He sets his eyes on the legal profession, which has been predominantly lorded over by men and women who are bonded by brotherhood and sisterhood. Diokno, who in ,Engkwentro, (2009) has shown how uncompromising he is when it comes to political and social issues, is bound to ruffle a few feathers given that the topic of his film seems to close to reality.,Iisa, ,Director:, Chuck Gutierrez,Synopsis:, A thriller about a never-ending war, a town ravaged by a devastating storm and the woman caught in between.,Why you should get excited:, Chuck Gutierrez has served as editor for Arnel Mardoquio in ,Riddles of My Homecoming, (2013) and ,Alienasyon, (2014).

{"content": "\nAmong agencies, the Office of the President, along with the education and public works departments are the top gainers    , ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 As a taxpayer, you may be wondering how the government spends your money. One way of knowing is by paying close attention to the national budget.,The proposed P3.35-trillion ($70.65-billion) national budget for 2017 is 11.6% higher than the 2016 budget and represents 21% of the projected gross domestic product (GDP) for 2017. It is the highest proposed by any administration so far.,Among agencies, the Office of the President and the education and public works departments are the top gainers.,The 2017 budget represents the first financial plan of the new president. The Duterte administration, however, ,had only about a month, to insert programs as ,budget calls started January 2016 ,during the term of former president Benigno Aquino III. (READ: ,Next president limited by Aquino admin budget for 2 years \u2013 Briones,),Apart from knowing where taxes go, the national budget reveals whether campaign promises will be sustained.,On the campaign trail, President Rodrigo Duterte promised higher salaries for uniformed personnel, massive infrastructure upgrades, and easing traffic in Metro Manila. (READ: ,SONA 2016: The Duterte promise tracker,),Dubbed the \"Budget for Real Change\", the proposed National Expenditure Program (NEP) for 2017 was ,submitted, mid-August by the Department of Budget and Management to Congress. It signaled the start of months-long deliberations on the programs and projects of government next year.,In this piece, we take a deeper look at the proposed national budget.,What's in the 2017 national budget? Will promised programs be funded in the coming fiscal year? The spreadsheet below shows the comparison of the proposed budget to this year's.,Top gainers,Which government agency gained the most in the proposed 2017 national budget?,According to the, 2017 Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing, (BESF), education, infrastructure, and local government sectors gained the most, among others.,In terms of percentage increase, the budget of the President's offices has the highest increase at 600.35% compared to this year's budget. The Department of Education's (DepEd's) Office of the Secretary received the highest proposed increase in funds at P135.13 billion ($2.85 billion).,With a glaring 600% budget hike, the DBM ,explained, that the Office of the President's P20.03 billion ($422.4 million) budget for 2017 includes some P15.46 billion ($326.02 million) for the 50th founding anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The Philippines will play host next year.,The budget department announced that sans the ,hosting expenses,, the financial plan for the President's offices will grow by only P1.71 billion ($27.37 million) from 2016's P2.86 billion allocation ($60.22 million).,The DBM explained that money will be used primarily for intelligence activities related to the president's war against drugs, criminals, and corruption. In the ,NEP,, the budget on oversight management on national security concerns is about P2.76 billion ($58.19 million).,Meanwhile, DepEd's suggested allocation for 2017 is pegged at P566.24 billion ($11.94 billion). It represents a 31.35% jump from this year's allocation of P431.11 billion ($9.09 billion). Half of it will go to teachers' salaries and school buildings, as outlined in the ,NEP,.,The table below shows that DepEd is followed by the Department of Public Works and Highways' Office of the Secretary budget with P61.50 billion ($1.30 billion) and the Internal Revenue Allotment at P58.27 billion ($1.23 billion) in terms of proposed increase in funds:,2017 (Proposed),[In billion  pesos],2016 (Adjusted),[In billion  pesos],Increase ,[In billion  pesos],%,DPWH received a 15.49% increase from this year's allocation of P397.11 billion ($8.37 billion). The P458.61-billion ($9.67-billion) proposed budget by the public works department will be used primarily for building road networks and flood control systems.,Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Allotment for local governments received a 13.59% increase at P486.89 billion ($10.28 billion) from 2016's P428.62-billion ($10.18 billion) allocation.,The treemap below shows the distribution of funds among agencies in the proposed financial plan. Similar to the previous years' budgets, the education sector got the lion's share of funds, while the Office of the Vice President got the smallest slice of the pie this year. (To see the 2016 and 2015 budgets, click the other tabs.),Top losers?,The Department of Health (DOH), National Housing Authority, and the Commission on Elections got the biggest cuts for 2017.,The DOH Office of the Secretary proposed a P92.97-billion ($1.96-billion) budget in 2017, or P31.09 billion ($654.37 million) less than this year's P124.06-billion ($2.61 billion) allocation.,This is not to say, however, that the budget for the health sector received the biggest cut.,The reason for the decrease in funds is attributed to the transfer of insurance premiums. In the 2016 budget, these are lodged under the National Health Insurance Program of the government. Next year, it will be transferred to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, one of the agencies with the biggest increases in funding \u2013 by P50.22 billion ($1.06 billion). (See table above),In sum, the proposed budget for the health sector is at P144.3 billion ($3.04 billion), 15.4% higher than 2016 figures.,The table below shows the top 10 agencies with the highest drop in funds in the proposed 2017 budget:,2017 (proposed),[In billion  pesos],2016 (adjusted),[In billion  pesos],Decrease,[In billion  pesos],%,-,The suggested budget for the National Housing Authority in 2017 is at P12.64 billion ($266.04 million) which is significantly lower than this year's allocation of P30.48 billion ($641.53 million).,The decrease in funds is partly due to NHA's decreased share of housing assistance program for Super Typhoon Yolanda victims. In the 2016 budget, about P25.6 billion ($538.82 million) was allotted for Yolanda reconstruction. while the amount is lowered to P1.3 billion ($27.36 million) for 2017, following the rehabilitation plan.,Next year, the bulk of the housing funds will go to the government's resettlement program for informal settler families living in danger zones.,For obvious reasons, the Comelec's share of funds is substantially lowered in 2017 as this year's budget included allocation for the national elections.,Will promised programs be funded?,The President has been very vocal about his promises, coupled with very strict deadlines.,Among those promised are the pay hike for cops and soldiers, sustaining the Conditional Cash Transfer program, and infrastructure upgrades. (READ: ,SONA 2016: The Duterte promise tracker,),With only ,about a month, to prioritize his promises in the 2017 national budget, the Duterte administration is limited by what the previous administration has planned, as ,budget calls started last January,.,Initially, Duterte promised last July to implement ,\"incremental\", ,salary increase for soldiers ,by August. However, budget chief Diokno explained that this year's budget has no item to grant the increase.,Next year, soldiers and policemen can expect a slight raise in their salaries as P40 billion ($844.50 million) has been allocated for the promise to be realized.,Meanwhile, the highly popular CCT program ,remains in the government's 2017 budget, with an allocation of P54.9 billion ($1.16 billion). Diokno announced that ,strict measures will be implemented, to avoid leakages.,Living up to Duterte's promises, the country's total infrastructure spending for 2017 will increase to P860.7 billion ($18.18 billion), equivalent to 5.4% of the GDP.,Expenditure Program,In terms of sectoral allocation, social services get the biggest chunk of the budget at P1.35 trillion ($28.46 billion), followed by economic services at P923.95 billion ($19.48 billion).,General public services \u2013 which include allocations for general administration, public order and safety, other general public services, and subsidies to local government units (LGUs) \u2013 are to be given P581.84 billion ($12.27 billion). Defense gets P147.76 billion ($3.12 billion).,The chart below shows allocation per sector in the 2017 NEP as well as in the 2016 GAA:,Compared to the previous administration, the proposed financial plan for 2017 has reduced debt service payments to P334.88 billion ($7.07 billion) from P392.80 billion ($8.29 billion) in 2016. The new deficit target inceased to 3% of GDP.,Higher budget deficit \u2013 which will translate to infrastructure programs and human capital expenditure \u2013 will \"substantially offset\" lower debt service, explained Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez in an ,earlier report.,In the ,President's budget message,, the new deficit target for the coming years will allow the administration to spend more on infrastructure, rural development, and social services.,Given the limitations in the proposed national budget for 2017, will the Duterte administration be able to fully maximize the nation's purse?,\u2013 Rappler.com,$1 = P47.43", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/budget-watch/145988-proposed-2017-national-budget", "title": "What's in the proposed 2017 national budget?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/103854-lower-2016-budgets-sucs-terry-ridon,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/49482-tayao-opportunity-mindanao,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/23894-up-student-kills-self-unpaid-tuition,http://www.rappler.com/nation/119794-dbm-budget-call-2017,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/129814-new-president-limited-aquino-admin-budget-leonor-briones"},

Part of the 9-man Senate Electoral Tribunal are Senior Justice Antonio Carpio, Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro, and Associate Justice Arturo Brion. Photos from the Supreme Court website ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 While Senator Grace Poe already ,announced her bid for the presidency, in next year's polls, she has yet to win another fight \u2013 win the disqualification case filed against her before the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET).,The SET is ,expected to decide by November, the case filed last August by 2013 senatorial candidate Rizalito David, who questioned the validity of Poe's senatorial candidacy and victory. The case refers to the issue of whether Poe is a natural-born Filipino citizen, and whether she was able to fulfil the constitutional two-year residency requirement for seeking a Senate seat.,To decide on Poe's case are the 9 members of SET, which includes 3 Supreme Court (SC) justices and 6 senators. (READ: ,Do you know the SET that will decide Grace Poe's fate?,),The 3 SC justices who are also members of SET are:,Just how will these 3 justices decide on the case? Do their votes in past disqualification cases brought to the High Court show any pattern that could provide a clue on how they would decide on Poe's case?,Rappler looked at recent cases filed before the SC that deal with the disqualification of a candidate due to citizenship. See how the justices decided in these cases.,1. ,Reyes vs Comelec, et al.,G.R. 207264,June 25, 2013,The SC affirmed the Comelec decision which disqualified Marinduque Representative Regina Reyes, who won in the May 2013 elections, for allegedly being a naturalized American. ,Reyes claimed she had acquired dual citizenship due to her marriage to an American citizen, and was able to renounce her foreign citizenship in 2012.,Reyes claimed being a Filipino-American citizen and insisted that Republic Act 9225 (or the Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act) applies to her. It states that natural-born citizens of the Philippines who become citizens of another country shall be deemed not to have lost their Philippine citizenship.,The SC disagreed with Reyes and ruled that aside from her bare allegation that she is a natural-born citizen, she submitted no proof to support or showed any proof as to the inapplicability of RA 9225 to her.,The SC added that Reyes also made several claims in her petition in the High Court which she didn't point out when the case was still pending with the Comelec.,\"All in all, considering that the petition for denial and cancellation of the COC is summary in nature, the Comelec is given a wide discretion in the evaluation and admission of evidence pursuant to its principal objective of determining whether or not the COC should be cancelled,\" the Court said.,VERDICT:, Justice Leonardo-de Castro, concurred with the decision, but ,Justices Brion and Carpio, dissented. In his dissent, Justice Brion was of the opinion that the Court \u201chastily\u201d judged the case without hearing both parties. \u201cThe Court should at least hear and consider both sides before making a ruling that would favor the son of a Member of the Court,\u201d Brion said.,Reyes claimed that Justice Presbitero Velasco Jr, whose son Lord Allan Jay Velasco she challenged in the elections, used \"his unelected position\" to influence the High Court into dismissing her petition. (READ: ,Disqualified Marinduque bet: SC favored justice's son,),2. ,Japzon vs Comelec, et al.,G.R. 180088,January 19, 2009,SC dismissed the petition of Manuel Japzon, who sought the disqualification of Jaime Ty. Both ran for mayor in General MacArthur, Eastern Samar in the May 2007 elections, with Ty winning the race.,Japzon claimed that Ty failed to renounce his American citizenship, which he acquired due to his migration to the US. However, the Comelec found that Ty was able to do so before filing his candidacy.,Japzon then argued before the SC that Ty lost his \"domicile of origin\" when he became a naturalized American citizen, and that he did not reacquire Philippine citizenship by merely taking an oath, as required under RA 9225.,The SC said in its decision: \"He could still retain his domicile in the USA, and he did not necessarily regain his domicile in the Municipality of General MacArthur, Eastern Samar. Ty merely had the option to  reestablish his domicile in the Municipality of General Macarthur, said place becoming his new \"domicile of choice\" (or residence of choice). The length of his residence therein shall be determined from the time he made it his domicile of choice, and it shall not retroact to the time of his birth.\",The SC noted that for election purposes, the terms \"domicile\" and \"residence\" are synonymous and interchangeable.,The SC added that Ty was able to prove that he stayed in the municipality one year before the elections, making him eligible to run for public office.,VERDICT: ,All 3 justices, concurred with the decision.,3. ,Maquiling vs Comelec, et al.,G.R. 195649,April 16, 2013,The SC reversed a Comelec en banc decision and decided to disqualify Mayor Rommel Arnado of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte.,Arnado was earlier disqualified by the Comelec's first division after it was discovered that he still used his US passport months before the 2010 elections despite renouncing his American citizenship in 2009. The Comelec en banc, however, sided with Arnado, saying that the use of a foreign passport is not one of the grounds for losing Philippine citizenship.,Rival candidate Casan Maquiling elevated the case to the SC, which voted against Arnado.,\"Between 03 April 2009, the date he renounced his foreign citizenship, and 30 November 2009, the date he filed his COC, he used his US passport four times, actions that run counter to the affidavit of renunciation he had earlier executed. By using his foreign passport, Arnado positively and voluntarily represented himself as an American, in effect declaring before immigration authorities of both countries that he is an American citizen, with all attendant rights and privileges granted by the United States of America,\" according to the SC decision.,VERDICT: ,Justice Carpio, concurred with the decision, while ,Justices Leonardo-De Castro and Brion, dissented. In his dissenting opinion, Brion said that Arnado's use of his US passport \"did not amount to an express renunciation of his Philippine citizenship.\",Brion explained that an express renunciation is \"manifested by direct and appropriate language, as distinguished from that which is inferred from conduct.\" He added that Arnado merely used his US passport without any indication of his intent to re-acquire US citizenship.,4. ,Jacot vs Dal, et al,G.R. 179848,November 27, 2008,The SC dismissed the Petition for Review filed by Nestor Jacot, the winning vice mayoral candidate of Catarman, Camiguin in the 2007 elections, after Comelec disqualified him for not renouncing his United States (US) citizenship.,In his petition, Jacot claimed that his Oath of Allegiance to the Philippines was done in Los Angeles, and that the oath contained in his Certificate of Candidacy operated as an effective renunciation of his foreign citizenship.,In its decision, the SC held that the oath of allegiance in Jacot's COC \"does not constitute the personal and sworn renunciation sought under Republic Act 9225.\",VERDICT: ,Justice Carpio, concurred with the decision. ,Justices Leonardo-de Castro and Brion, were on leave.,5. ,Lopez vs Comelec, et al,G.R. 182701,July 23, 2008,The SC affirmed the Comelec decision to disqualify Eusebio Eugenio K. Lopez as barangay chairman in Iloilo City after he won in the 2007 barangay elections.,Lopez was born a Filipino but he sought American citizenship and renounced his Filipino citizenship. He claimed becoming a dual citizen by re-acquiring Filipino citizenship prior to the elections.,He added that he possessed all the qualifications to run by returning to the Philippines and residing in the barangay.,But the Comelec found that he was not able to reacquire his Filipino citizenship in the manner provided by law. The SC sided with the Comelec, saying that RA 9225 \"explicitly provides that should one seek elective public office, he should first make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath.\",\"While it is true that petitioner won the elections, took his oath and began to discharge the functions of Barangay Chairman, his victory cannot cure the defect of his candidacy.\",VERDICT: ,All 3 justices, concurred with the decision. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/106409-set-justices-voting-pattern-grace-poe", "title": "Before Grace Poe's case, how did SC justices vote in the past?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/105980-grace-poe-declaration-2016,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/105500-set-decision-disqualification-case-november"},

Formal negotiations between the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines begin on Monday, August 22   ,OSLO, Norway \u2013 For a moment, it was as if the two sides were no longer at war.,They arrived in barong tagalog, both panels representing the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF) and featuring hardcore guerrillas who have presided over Asia's most stubborn insurgency.,The euphoria is palpable at the opening of peace negotiations in Oslo on Monday, August 22. ,Senior communist rebels were all smiles \u2013 hugging each other and celebrating the presence of their comrades from prison and the underground. Among them are biggest names in the movement based on military records \u2013 Benito Tiamzon, Alan Jazmines, and Rafael Baylosis.,\u201cWhat I\u2019m most happy about is the release of the NDFP consultants. I haven\u2019t seen them for decades. Now they are suddenly out in the wide world from their confinements, from their small cells. Now they are here to be harnessed for work for the peace negotiations,\u201d Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria Sison told Rappler. (READ: ,Joma Sison, Tiamzons reunited after 30 years,),Nobel room,NOBEL ROOM. The opening ceremony was held in a room named after a peace award.  ,The venue couldn\u2019t be more appropriate for the task this week of the two warring sides \u2013 a room called Nobel in a hilltop hotel overlooking the Scandinavian capital.,The revolutionaries were seated on the right side of the room while the government officials were seated on the left. They crossed the room to take photos together before the program started, in a show of familarity born from their involvement in previous peace negotiations.,Sison, Tiamzon and the rest clenched their fists upwards while the government representatives clenched their first forward, the campaign symbol of President Rodrigo Duterte in the May 2016 elections. \u201c,Pareho naman pala tayo e. Clenched fist. ,(We\u2019re the same, you see. We clench our fists.),\u201d was repeatedly heard in the room. ,LINKING ARMS. Members of the government and NDFP panels link arms to show unity in their aim to have peace ,In the middle of the room were representatives of the Norwegian government that has supported the talks \u2013 Foreign Minister Borge Brende and Special Envoy to the Philippine Peace Process Ambassador Elisabeth Slattum \u2013 and who were glad that the negotiations have resumed since the impasse in 2011.,\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the warmth and the exchanges, informal and formal on both sides. Let that be assessed by you and by those who are able to witness the atmosphere that prevailed during the opening,\u201d said presidential peace adviser Jesus Dureza.,Formed more than 4 decades ago, the CPP is behind a protracted war that has survived Martial Law in the 1970s, the 1986 EDSA revolution that isolated the guerrillas, a bloody internal purge in the 1990s, and the bitter split that followed.,Five post-Marcos presidents attemped to talk peace with the rebels, holding a total of 40 rounds of negotiations with them. All failed. (READ: ,Fast Facts: The CPP-NPA-NDF and the Oslo talks,),The Duterte-led negotiations promise to be different. (READ: ,#AnimatED: Hope in Oslo,),Joma all praises,Sison was all praises for President Duterte, his former student in the 1970s.,\u201cFor the first time in the history of the Philippines, a president has emerged by denouncing the abuses of the oligarchy and the folly of servility to foreign powers and by using street language and methods of the mass movement,\u201d Sison said in his opening speech.,It was a welcome change in tone following a heated verbal exchange with the President following the ,CPP's failure, to reciprocate the first ceasefire that Duterte had announced in his first State of the Nation Address. This raised fears that all the confidence-building measures done prior to this \u2013 such as the appointment of NDF allies to the Cabinet \u2013 would be put to waste. ,The warrior is now a peace negotiator,NEGOTIATORS. Norway's Special Envoy to the Philippine Peace Process Ambassador Elisabeth Slattum welcomes Wilma Tiamzon to the peace negotiation ,What makes this different is the participation of key CPP leaders from the Philippines.,It's the first time for Tiamzon to join the peace negotiations.,He was tagged as the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d of the CPP's armed wing, the New People\u2019s Army (NPA), whose face was unknown to many \u2013 including the NPA rebels \u2013 until he and his wife were arrested in Cebu in 2015.,Tiamzon\u2019s new role as peace negotiator is a task completely different from the decades he had spent plotting and staging a revolution. He watched the formal process from a seat behind panel members, moved from one photo session or media interview after another.,\u201cI was in high school when I last wore a barong,\u201d a smiling Tiamzon told comrades who were happy to see him and his wife Wilma, also a top CPP-NPA personality, finally free again. (Read: ,Tiamzon: Writer, organizer, party man,),But the couple were also feeling the burden of the responsibility. \u201c,Noon pa lamang sa Maynila, pumapasok na sa isip ko kung paano talaga kami lulugar dito sa usapang pangkapayapaan ,(When we were still in Manila, it crossed my mind how we\u2019re going to find our place in the peace talks),\u201d Wilma Tiamzon told Rappler after the ceremonies.,\u201c,Ibang-iba, (It\u2019s really different),\u201d Benito chimed in.,How will the \"ground\" feel about their participation in the peace talks?,\u201c,Palagay ko matutuwa sila. Unang-una, nakalahok kami dito at naging dahilan ng aming kagyat na paglaya. Marami ang naghihintay at tuwang tuwa na kami ay nakalaya na. Umaasa sila na ang paglahok namin dito ay magiging positibo para sa rebolusyunaryong kilusan,,\u201d Wilma said. (We think they're happy about it. We're now involved and this is the reason for our release. Many have been waiting for our release. They are hoping for a positive outcome.),\u201c,Ang nakikibakang masa ang puno at ang siyang magiging dulo ng lahat ng pag-uusap dito,,\u201d added Benito Tiamzon. (The struggling masses are why we're in this process, and they will also determine its outcome.),Tiamzon\u2019s involvement addresses an issue that was raised in previous attempts to talk peace: that it is useless to talk peace with Sison alone because of doubts that the exiled CPP founder still controls the combatants on the ground.,Former government chief peace negotiator Alex Padilla said Tiamzon was the hardliner who was behind the difficult preconditions to the talks (READ: ,Joma wants peace, the ground doesn't,),Government chief negotiator Silvestre Bello III, who is an old hand at the job, is confident that Tiamzon's participation is key to the success of the peace talks that they seek to finish within a year. (READ: ,PH hopes for peace deal in a year,),\u201cIt is an opportunity for them to have a wider consultation. Hopefully, it could give them a clearer view of the situation,\u201d Bello said.  ,\u201cFor the panel, and even for our President, the fact that we are determined to talk to them is clear indication that our intel community considers them as the right group to talk to. Otherwise, it will be senseless coming here,\u201d Bello said.  , ,It won't be easy. ,There are agendas to push forward when the two panels sit down beginning Tuesday, August 23.,\"T,he road to peace is not easy and rosy, considering the long history of animosity, suspicion and armed conflict that troubled our land. ,Let us all stay the course no matter what,\" Dureza said in his opening statement. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/143908-day-one-oslo-ndf-talks%20", "title": "Warriors, negotiators: Optimism on Day 1 of Oslo talks", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/156674-duterte-christmas-eve-photos,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/133877-two-pronged-ofw-husband-wife,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/nation/143801-oslo-talks-reunion-joma-sison-tiamzon,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/143551-cpp-npa-ndf-peace-talks"},

Edgardo Militar found infant Poe in the Parish of Jaro in Iloilo.,September 6, \u2013 Emiliano Militar reported to the Office of the Civil Registrar of Iloilo City that they found an infant.

Grace Poe's new birth certificate after legal adoption. (Photo by Office of Sen. Grace Poe) ,While petitioner Rizalito David said Poe\u2019s adoption did not confer to her the same Philippine citizenship of her adoptive parents and that she remains to be stateless, Poe argued that the rights of a foundling are supported by international declarations, most of which the Philippines is a signatory to.,On August 21, 1990, the Philippines ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, protecting the right of a new-born to a nationality, and to ensure that every child is protected from statelessness from birth.,The 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the Philippines ratified on October 23, 1986, recognized the right of every child \u201cto acquire a nationality.\u201d,While the country adopted these two conventions years after Poe was born, her camp said they are retroactive. Citing the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, they said there is no prohibition against the retroactive application of treaties unless a different intention appears.,What is prohibited, Poe\u2019s camp said, is the application of a treaty to a fact or status which does not exist before the treaty entered into force. After all, they said Poe remained to be a foundling before and after the ratifications.,Poe\u2019s camp also cited the deliberations of the framers of the 1935 Constitution. While it did not expressly mention foundlings in Section 1, Article 4, former Senator Manuel Roxas said they would not include foundlings because the number of cases are few and that international laws are there to protect them. ,\u201cMr. President, my humble opinion is that these cases are few and far in between, that the constitution need [not] refer to them. By international law the principle that children or people born in a country of unknown parents are citizens in this nation is recognized, and it is not necessary to include a provision on the subject exhaustively,\u201d Roxas said, as cited by Poe\u2019s verified answer.,Poe\u2019s lawyers also cited other countries that have the same citizenship law as the Philippines (,jus sanguinis, or \u201cby blood\u201d). Countries such as Austria and United Kingdom have passed laws that presume foundlings to be born of parents who are citizens of the country in which they are found.,Her lawyers also argued that the Philippines had long recognized the generally accepted principle of international law on foundlings. Citing DOJ Opinion Number 189, series of 1951, Poe\u2019s camp said the DOJ recognized foundlings as citizens of the country in which they are found., ,1986,December 13, \u2013 After Poe turned 18 years old, she obtained a voter\u2019s identification card at Greenhills, San Juan, but the name indicated was Ma.

She went back to the Philippines to give birth to her second child.,July 10, \u2013 She gave birth to second child Hanna in the Philippines., ,2001,October 18, \u2013 Poe was naturalized as a citizen of the US after being petitioned by her husband who is a dual citizen. As she took an oath of allegiance to the US, she renounced her Philippine citizenship:,\"I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.\",The camp of Poe, however, said Poe took an oath of allegiance to the US \u201conly as a necessary condition for her naturalization.\u201d,\u201cAfter her naturalization, [Poe] maintained her ties to the Philippines and visited the country frequently. She never foreclosed the possibility of one day returning to the Philippines, as indeed, she returned in 2005,\u201d stated in the verified reply., ,2004 ,April 8, \u2013 Then pregnant Poe went back to the Philippines with second daughter Hanna. ,May 10 \u2013, The 2004 presidential elections was held.

She also requested the same for her 3 children, which is allowed under the same law.,Section 3 of the law states that \"[a]ny provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, natural-born citizenship by reason of their naturalization as citizens of a foreign country are hereby deemed to have re-acquired Philippine citizenship upon taking the following oath of allegiance to the Republic:\" ,Oath of Allegiance to Philippines. (Photo by Office of Sen. Grace Poe) , ,July 10, \u2013 Poe filed for dual citizenship, in accordance to RA 9225. Ironic as it may seem, this law used by Poe to push for her case was signed by former President Gloria Arroyo in 2003, who allegedly cheated her father in the 2004 presidential elections.,Following the law, she filed with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) a sworn petition to reacquire her natural-born Philippine citizenship. She used her cancelled Philippine passport as proof of former natural born status. This is, allowed ,by the Bureau of Immigration. ,July 18, \u2013 Then BI Commissioner Alipio Fernandez Jr issued an order granting Poe\u2019s petitions.,Poe\u2019s camp said this also grants her 3 children Philippine citizenship.,July 31, \u2013 The BI issued Identification Certificates (IC) for Poe and her kids. This means Poe and her 3 kids re-acquired their Philippine citizenship as per the law. At this point, they are now dual citizens of the US and the Philippines. ,Photo by Office of Sen. Grace Poe ,August 31 ,\u2013 Poe registered as a voter of Barangay Santa Lucia, San Juan. It is a requirement for a voter to have resided for at least a year in the Philippines before the elections. With this and with the presumption of regularity, Poe\u2019s voter ID implied she was in the country not later than August 31, 2005., ,2009,October 13, \u2013 As a dual citizen, she was issued a Philippine passport. ,Published reports said that Poe used her US passport from 2005 to December 2009 at least 21 times in entering and leaving the country. Some say these repeated acts alone may weaken her defense of ,animus revertendi, or intention to return to domicile. (READ: ,Grace Poe and Pandora\u2019s box: Legal issues in her candidacy,),It is important to note, however, that from 2005 to early July 2006, Poe was a US citizen and, therefore, only had a US passport.,From July 2006 to 2009, meanwhile, she already acquired dual citizenship of the Philippines and the US and had the discretion to use either of the two passports in her travels.,Poe\u2019s camp argued that her oath of allegiance to the Philippines in 2006 \u201cwas not 'forfeited' or rendered 'meaningless' simply because she continued using her US passport after she had reacquired her natural-born Philippine citizenship on 7 July 2006.\u201d, ,2010,October 6, \u2013 President Benigno Aquino III appointed her as chairperson of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB), but Poe said she \u201cdid not accept it immediately.\u201d In the verified answer, Poe said she was informed that the same RA 9225 prohibits appointment of a dual citizen to government UNLESS she renounces her foreign citizenship.,Section 5 of the law states that:,\u201cThose appointed to any public office shall subscribe and swear to an oath of allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines and its duly constituted authorities prior to their assumption of office: ,Provided,, That they renounce their oath of allegiance to the country where they took that oath.\u201d ,October 20, \u2013 Before a notary public in Pasig City, she signed an \u201cAffidavit of Renunciation of Allegiance to the United States of America and Renunciation of American Citizenship.\u201d,Section 3 of RA 9225 also states:,\u201cThose seeking elective public in the Philippines shall meet the qualification for holding such public office as required by the Constitution and existing laws and, at the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy, make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath.\u201d,Photo by Office of Sen. Grace Poe , ,October 21, \u2013 She submitted to the BI the notarized document and took oath as MTRCB chair. Poe argued that when she sat as government official, she had already renounced her American citizenship. ,Her lawyers also argued that \u201cunder Philippine law, Poe continued to be a US citizen until 20 October 2010 when she renounced her US citizenship\u201d before a notary public.,They added \"under the laws of the US, her act of taking her oath of office as MTRCB Chairperson was an expatriating act which caused her to lose her US citizenship.\u201d,In her former US passport, it was indicated that she self-expatriated herself on October 21, 2010, the day she took oath in Philippine government., ,2011,July 12, \u2013 she executed before the Vice Consul at the US Embassy in Manila an Oath/Affirmation of Renunciation of Nationality of the United States. Poe also accomplished a sworn questionnaire before the US Vice consul.,On page 4 of the questionnaire, Poe wrote:,\u201cI became a resident of the Philippines once again since 2005. My mother still resides in the Philippines. My husband and I are both employed and own properties in the Philippines. As a dual citizen (Filipino-American) since 2006, I\u2019ve voted in two Philippine national elections. My three children study and reside in the Philippines\u2026\u201d,December 9, \u2013 Poe\u2019s Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the US was signed by the Vice Consul on this date.,In this document, it was stated that Poe \u201cexpatriated her self\u201d on October 21, 2010, when she took an oath of office as MTRCB chair. This is the same date shown in her former US passport.,SIGNED. This was signed by the Vice Consul on December 9, 2011 but US State Dept. 'approved' it on February 3, 2012. (Photo by Office of Sen. Grace Poe) ,2012,February 3, \u2013 The certificate of loss of nationality was \u201capproved\u201d by the State Department only in 2012.,Poe, in an interview on June 10, 2015, said: \",Ngayon tungkol dun sa US, ni-release po nila ang aking renunciation 2012. Bakit? Sapagkat sila ay may prosesong napakahaba. Hindi ka basta pupunta sa US embassy para mag-submit\u2026. Kailangan doon ang tax return mo doon in the last 5 years, ari-arian mo in the last 5 years. Ang daming dokumento.\u201d,(Now, about the US, they released my renunciation in 2012. Why? Because they have a long process. You cannot just go to US embassy to submit. The have to look into your tax returns from the last 5 years, your properties in the last 5 years. There are many documents needed.),October 2, \u2013 Poe filed her Certificate of Candidacy (COC).,Petitioner David accused Poe of lying in her COC when she said she had been residing in the country for 6 years and 6 months as of May 13, 2013. With all the arguments earlier discussed, Poe\u2019s lawyers said this allegation is false, as Poe met the two-year residency requirement for a senator.,In a foreshadowing of what may be thrown at her in 2016, Poe\u2019s lawyers, in the verified reply, argued that Poe made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d in her COC. ,\u201cThe truth is that, as of 13 May 2013, [Poe] had been residing in the Philippines for more than six (6) years and six (6) months.\" They said this mistake was an \"excusable error arising from complex legal principles that a layman is not expected to fully know, much less understand.\" They said Poe was not accompanied by a legal counsel when she filled out the form.,They also argued that \u201cgood faith is more manifested\u201d because Poe indicated a shorter period of stay in her COC, saying she would have benefitted more if she indicated a longer period. This, they said, \u201cclearly shows that she honestly misunderstood what was being asked of her in her COC, and that she did not intend to mislead or deceive anyone.\u201d,Her camp said it is not the first time a candidate committed an honest mistake in stating her period of residency in the COC.,\u201cThe Supreme Court was faced with precisely this problem in Romualdez-Marcos vs. COMELEC. However, instead of making the candidate pay for her mistake by disqualifying her, the Supreme Court stressed that the 'residency requirement' is ultimately a question of fact. The statement in the COC is not 'decisive.'\u201d, ,2013,May 16, \u2013 Poe was proclaimed senator of the Philippines after ,topping the senatorial elections,.,December 19, \u2013 As a senator, she was issued a diplomatic passport., ,2014,March 18, \u2013 She was issued a regular Philippine passport., ,2015,August 6, \u2013 David filed a ,disqualification case, against Poe before the Senate Electoral Tribunal. ,August 17, \u2013 David filed a ,similar case, before the Commission on Elections.,September 1, \u2013 Poe, submitted her verified answer, with ,supporting documents, to the SET, with the following prayers:,\u2013 ,Rappler.com ,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

{"content": "\nAfter 40 rounds of talks under 5 Philippine governments, the peace process with communist guerrillas begins on a high note in Oslo\n,POLITICAL SETTLEMENT? The latest round of peace talks between the government and communist rebels is set to take place in Oslo, Norway. Graphic by Ernest Fiestan/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Is a political settlement already on the horizon for one of the world's longest running insurgencies?, ,After failed attempts at peace under 5 Philippine presidents, the government of President Rodrigo Duterte is set to return to the negotiating table with the National Democratic Front (NDF), the political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).,From August 22 to 28, negotiators from both sides will hold ,peace talks in Oslo, Norway, in an attempt to hammer out an acceptable solution to end the armed struggle that has claimed thousands of lives since 1969. (READ: ,Joma Sison, Tiamzons reunited after 30 years,),Here's a brief explainer on the communist movement in the Philippines and the many attempts \u2013 spanning years \u2013 to craft a peace agreement with communist rebels.,Founded in 1968 by former student activist Jose Maria Sison, the CPP seeks to ,establish a new democratic state, in the Philippines that will be led by the working class and be free from the influence of the United States. The group modeled its armed struggle and protracted people's war after China's Maoist movement.,The CPP has two related units: its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), which was established in 1969; and its political arm, the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF). The NDF is the umbrella organization of communist-run organizations, and it represents the CPP-NPA in negotiations with the Philippine government., ,The armed struggle of the CPP-NPA is Asia's longest-running communist insurgency. Since its establishment, the group has engaged in guerrilla warfare against government forces, believing armed revolution to be the solution to replace what it considers the current oppressive system. It funds its activities primarily through \"revolutionary taxes,\" forcing businesses to pay the group to avoid being attacked.,From 60 members in 1969, the group attracted followers all over the country, reaching its peak of about 25,000 members in 1987, according to military estimates. The group's numbers have since declined following years of military operations and internal purges within the CPP-NPA, with less than 4,000 rebels estimated as of present. But the CPP continues to gather support in poor rural areas around the country.,For the past 3 decades and 5 Philippine presidents, there have been attempts to hold peace negotiations with the CPP and hammer out a political settlement to end the armed conflict. ,According to the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, over ,40 rounds of talks, have been held, but snagged on contentious issues on sovereignty, the release of political prisoners, and the CPP's inclusion in terrorist lists. Over 1,300 political detainees were released by the government, and 20 agreements have been signed \u2013 yet no final peace settlement has been agreed upon.,In 1986, the administration of former president Corazon Aquino began peace talks with the CPP, but this was unsuccessful. Another attempt was made in 1995 under the administration of former president Fidel V. Ramos, which culminated in the signing of two agreements: the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG), which guarantees free and safe movement for those involved in peace negotiations; and the Comprehensive Agreement to Respect Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL).,Negotiations once again stalled after this, with alternating periods of conflict and negotiations during the term of Ramos' successor, former president Joseph Estrada. Under former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the government returned to the negotiating table with the CPP-NPA, but this also broke down after the US listed the group as a terrorist organization.,Under former president Benigno Aquino III, several meetings and informal talks were held in Manila, Norway, and the Netherlands. Aquino's term, however, ended at an impasse due to the NDF's demand for the release of political prisoners. (TIMELINE: ,Arrest of CPP-NPA leaders under Aquino,),The meeting in Oslo from August 22 to 28 will be the first formal peace talks under the Duterte administration. This comes on the heels of informal talks earlier held in Norway, where the rebels agreed to resume negotiations with the government. ,The ,agenda, of the first meeting in Oslo will cover 5 major points:,The CPP also wants to discuss a general amnesty proclamation to cover the 550 detained members of the CPP-NPA.,But even before the formal start of the Oslo talks, tension flared between the two camps: in his first State of the Nation Address, Duterte declared a unilateral ceasefire, but quicky revoked it after the NPA attacked government militias in Davao del Norte. The NPA, however, said the military was to blame for violating the government-declared truce.,Sison and Duterte engaged in a brief word war, with the communist leader saying Duterte lacked prudence with his hasty decision to ,end the truce,, and Duterte hitting back by criticizing the CPP for overestimating its power.,POLITICAL PRISONERS. The CPP-NPA has demanded the release of political prisoners. Rappler file photo ,On the side of the government is Labor Secretary Silvestre \"Bebot\" Bello III, who had previously served as government panel chair in the negotiations during the Arroyo administration. (READ: ,Dureza, Bello, and the previous peace talks,),Representing the Left is NDF chief negotiator Luis Jalandoni. Joining the Oslo peace talks are 20 detainees, who were temporarily released to take part in the talks as consultants.,Among those released were ,NPA leaders Benito Tiamzon and wife Wilma Tiamzon,, and communist rebel leader Alfredo Mapano, also known as \u201c,Ka Paris,.\" (READ: ,Top NPA leaders go on 1st overseas trip for Oslo talks,),The Tiamzons were ,arrested in Cebu on March 22, 2014,, for multiple crimes against humanity, while Mapano faces multiple counts of criminal charges including murder, robbery and frustrated murder. ,Meanwhile, the Supreme Court confirmed as valid the bail of former Bayan Muna Representative Satur Ocampo, Vicente Ladlad, and Randall Echanis.

When he later sampled this in a round table interview at AsiaPOP Comic Con, one reporter just had to ask, \u201cWhat can\u2019t you do?\u201d (,WATCH: ,Colton Haynes sings, dances for PH fans at AsiaPOP Comic Con,) , ,\u201cI always wanted to start acting \u2013 that was always my goal,\u201d said the Kansas native, who also forayed into theater and considered studying musical theater. \u201cI think that\u2019s the most important thing \u2013 getting to do something that you love and something that makes you feel alive, and that does it for me.\u201d, ,Colton is no stranger to werewolf roles. He first played it on supernatural drama, ,The Gates,. However, he, ,was probably more well known for his run as Jackson, a conflicted lacrosse player-turned-,Kanima,-turned-werewolf, on MTV\u2019s ,Teen Wolf,., ,In recent years, he has gained even more prominence for playing the vigilante sidekick Roy Harper, code name: Arsenal, on the highly rated ,Arrow,.  About the first time he donned on the costume for the role, he said, \u201cIt just felt so cool, to actually be able to step up into that character and fight crime right alongside Oliver [Queen] and everything.\u201d, ,While he already exited from these super popular shows, he recently starred in the disaster flick ,San Andreas,. Now, he\u2019s working on one \u201cvery, very, very sad movie\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s still sad, when we finished \u2013 oh my gosh! When this movie comes out, you guys are gonna cry your eyes out,\u201d) and at least two projects that are still under wraps., ,Colton gave us a scoop about the future of his two well-known roles, and talked about his own fandoms. These are what we learned from him:, ,1. Colton can act, sing, and dance, but can\u2019t do math and cook. ,\u201cThose are the only things I can do \u2013 these things in the arts \u2013 luckily,\u201d he said., ,2., ,He had a huge welcome to Manila, by way of chopper: \u201c,We took a helicopter here, and it was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve probably ever done in my life \u2013 one of the most beautiful things.\u201d, , , ,He also said that the people in Manila have been \u201cso incredibly nice\u201d to him: \u201cEveryone\u2019s just apologizing and being so nice, and I\u2019m like, it\u2019s so cool to be here around people that love what you do.\", , , ,3., ,He tried a lot of Filipino food ,\u2013 ,sinigang, bistek, ,and, longganisa, \u2013 but \u201cthere\u2019s no way\u201d you can persuade him to eat ,balut,: \u201cWe totally had a whole-hour conversation about it, and I don\u2019t think I could do that.\u201d, ,\u201cAnd I also ordered a burger. You can take the boy out of Kansas, but you can\u2019t take the Kansas out of the boy,\u201d he added., ,4., ,\u201cHopefully, we do a sequel to ,San Andreas,,\u201d he said, ,adding, \u201cThe movie did really well. I think we crossed a really big milestone.\u201d, ,5. Colton is a big Taylor Swift fan,. \u201cTaylor Swift for President 2020!\u201d he exclaimed. He shared that he had even met her several times., ,When asked if he had a favorite song, he said, \u201cI think every one of her songs is amazing. I think her songwriting is just incredible.\u201d Although he said that he \u201cwon\u2019t do [the song] justice,\u201d he sang a few lines from \u201cBad Blood.\u201d, ,6. Colton had a geek moment at the ,Superman Returns ,(2006) premiere when he was just in high school. \u201c,I was like, geeking out. I\u2019ve never done anything in the industry before,\u201d he said., ,Brandon Routh, who was Superman, later appeared as Ray Palmer on ,Arrow,. Colton said, \u201cI was like, \u2018This is so embarrassing, I hope no one tells him that I had this weird fan moment with him.\u2019 Now, I got to work side-by-side him, so now he knows that I was a super geek fan.\u201d, , ,7. He\u2019s a fan of the comics himself, ,and even visited the DC headquarters and some comic book stores with his ,Arrow ,co-star Emily Bett Rickards (Felicity Smoak) in different cities., ,He was also quick to reference a key plot point, \u201cIt would be really cool to see how they\u2019re gonna do the Arsenal [arc] because I know ,in the comic books, he was missing an arm,. So that would be really interesting to see if maybe they do that with Speedy [Thea Queen], but who knows.\u201d, ,8. He would love to be in the upcoming Justice League film. \u201c,There have been no talks about it thus far,\u201d he said, urging people to just start a campaign on social media., ,9. He goes ,all out, with Halloween costumes, and he would probably cosplay as Felicity or Diggle. ,\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could rock the dress the way she does \u2013 especially her dangerous curves,\u201d he said about Felicity., , , ,He was also excited about Diggle\u2019s new costume, and even spoke with actor David Ramsey, \u201cThey\u2019re filming right now \u2013 I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to be back with you guys!\u2019\u201d, ,10. Colton admires his ,Arrow ,co-star Stephen Amell for being a family man and like \u201ca Rolodex of information.\u201d ,\u201cYou could literally name an episode, and he\u2019ll know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to bounce ideas off him, and know that he\u2019s gonna know the information, which is really cool.\u201d, , , ,11. He allegedly knows how to do the ,Salmon Ladder, ,better than Diggle ,(David Ramsey). \u201cIf he sees [this, he\u2019ll] get mad at me \u2018cause it\u2019s a lie,\u201d he quipped., ,12. He thinks there\u2019s not much difference between his characters Jackson and Roy., \u201cJackson didn\u2019t have a father, and was always trying to impress the father he never had. So, he had this very big complex. Roy is almost the same way,\u201d Colton said., ,However he said that Jackson was, at least for him, inadvertently comical: \u201cFor some reason, I didn\u2019t realize going into it that the lines were supposed to be funny, but when they get together and have these watch parties at Jeff Davis\u2019s house \u2013 he\u2019s the creator \u2013 everyone would laugh at my lines. I\u2019m like, \u2018What did I do wrong?\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s actually funny.\u2019, , ,13. There are bits from every character that he has played that resonates with Colton., He thinks that Roy is \u201cclosed off\u201d and has a \u201chard edge\u201d to his character, which he said is unlike him. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m pretty friendly, but he also does have that side of his character,\u201d he said., ,Colton explained, \u201cI\u2019m probably more like Roy when he\u2019s being nice, and I could be a little emotional like Jackson, too. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m as catty as Jackson. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m like, trying to run people over with my Porsche., ,14. The best thing about comic-based TV shows are the relatable charaters, he says: ,\u201cLike people look at Roy, and be like, \u2018I resonate with him,\u2019 or with Diggle, or with Felicity finally being a very strong woman on camera.\u201d He said that it\u2019s great to have this kind of diversity in these shows, \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to give voices to so many more people, and I think that\u2019s incredible.\u201d, ,15. Inside scoop: he may return to ,Arrow, and its spinoff shows. ,\u201cIt\u2019s one call away. You will definitely be seeing me back on,Arrow ,and possibly a few of the other spinoff shows going forward,\u201d said Colton. ,He also would love to appear on ,The Flash,. \u201cIf it happens, it\u2019s going to blow everyone\u2019s minds. That\u2019s ,if, it happens\u2026\u201d he said, as he winked at us, \u201cI think we\u2019re confirming.\u201d, ,16. Colton on the state of television: \u201c,TV has just continued to change for the better.\u201d He cited showrunners Greg Berlanti (,Arrow,) and Shonda Rhimes (,Grey\u2019s Anatomy ,and ,Scandal,), and said \u201cEveryone [is] just bringing so many diverse characters into television. That\u2019s so important.\u201d, ,He even praised his good friend Gina Rodriguez, the lead actress on ,Jane the Virgin,, who won the Golden Globe among many accolades. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that could have happened a couple of years ago, so TV has gone so far and it\u2019s only gonna continue to go farther,\u201d said Colton., ,17. His message for the fans: ,\u201cWe\u2019re having a blast. I\u2019ll never forget this trip, and thank you guys for supporting me and not being mean to me on social media,\u201d he said, saying that he tries to comment and like/favorite as much as he can., , ,He said, \u201cI think social media is a good way and a good outlet to really speak your mind, and I have not, luckily, had a lot of haters \u2013 which makes me feel really good\u2026 But you guys have been incredible, and hopefully you stick around for the future and for the ride.\u201d ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Paolo Abad is a film/television editor and motion graphic designer.

{"content": "\nThe Vice President turns the tables on his accusers, saying they too used the same contractor they are now questioning and adopted the practice of phasing projects     ,'NO EVIDENCE.' Vice President Jejomar Binay belittles all the accusations raised against him in a Senate inquiry into the allegedly overpriced Makati 'parking building.' Photo by Jose Del/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Vice President Jejomar Binay on Wednesday, August 27, belittled the allegations against him, saying that Makati even saved P200 million ($4.57 million*) on its so-called \u201cparking building\" alleged to be overpriced. ,Instead of facing a Senate investigation to answer the allegations of his critics, Binay opted to hold a press conference where he read an opening statement in the presence of his close allies, and took questions from reporters.,In the briefing at his office at the Coconut Palace in Pasay City, the former Makati mayor said the price of the 11-storey building was not P2.7 billion ($61.79 million), as claimed by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV and the ,complainants who cited a Commission on Audit (COA) memorandum,.,Binay said the estimated cost was P2.4 billion ($54.94 million) but the actual cost turned out to be only P2.2 billion ($50.36 million). The Vice President did not present documents to show this but said the city government has records that will be \u201cthe best evidence.\u201d,He said: \u201cP2.4 billion minus P2.2 billion, ,May, P200 million, pa nga ang, Makati. Ang phases ,na iyon ay nagkaroon ng, phases ,depende sa ,availability of funds. ,Ang ,estimated cost, po ay hindi, P2.7 billion, na pinalalaki nila. Ang ,estimated cost, po diyan ,was P2.4 billion., Ngayon, alam ba ninyo a,t the end of the day,, magkano po ang nagastos? ,P2.2 billion.\u201d,(P2.4 billion minus P2.2 billion. Makati even had P200 million left. The phases were done because the construction depends on the availability of funds. The estimated cost was not P2.7 billion that they are trying to balloon. The estimated cost was P2.4 billion. Now, do you know at the end of the day how much was spent? P2.2 billion.),Binay also turned the tables on his accusers, who along with COA Chairperson ,Grace Pulido-Tan questioned the building\u2019s division into 5 phases.,\u201c,Sabi mo,, according to Senator Cayetano,\u201d Binay told this reporter. \u201c,Sila mismo nagphe-,phasing, ah, baka akala mo. Sila rin nagpagawa sa kontratista namin. Hindi naman bawal iyon, in the first place, ang, phasing.\u201d,(You said, according to Senator Cayetano. They themselves do phasing, you know. They used our same contractor. In the first place, phasing is not illegal.),The Vice President was referring to Senate Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano, who said that Makati\u2019s phasing of the building appeared irregular because phases were added supposedly in the project without knowing the final cost. Binay maintained that the city government had P2.4 billion as the estimated cost. (READ: ,Binay: Senate probe 'badly written telenovela',),Binay\u2019s statement contradicted the stance of the COA chief who told the Senate last week that the practice of dividing projects into phases was a \u201c,red flag,.\u201d ,Why was awarding too fast?,One red flag Tan cited was the speed by which the building was awarded to the contractor, a process that only took two and a half months instead of what she said was the usual 6 months for a project of this magnitude.,A lawyer, Binay responded: \u201cJust because the project was done quickly, it doesn\u2019t mean it was questionable. It\u2019s not how long you work on it. It\u2019s the quality of time. But it was well within the period of time so provided in the law in instances like this. I think it starts from 44 calendar days to 100.\u201d,Binay's spokesman Joey Salgado later clarified that according to the Procurement Act, the procurement process from posting to award of contract covers a minimum of 28 calendar days and a maximum of 144. ,The Vice President said COA auditors and technical specialists did not make any adverse finding. \u201cCOA was there before we did every phase of construction. It was okay with them.\u201d,COA\u2019s resident auditor Cecilia Caga-anan though is a co-respondent of the Binays in the plunder case filed against them. The agency is doing a special audit on the building but Binay doubted how the COA can \u201creverse\u201d the findings of the resident auditor.,Binay and his son Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin \u201cJunjun\u201d Binay Jr are accused of overpricing the so-called parking building known as the Makati City Hall Building 2 by almost P2 billion ($45.80 million). They are the subjects of the Senate inquiry and a ,plunder complaint before the Ombudsman, over the issue.,The building was first constructed in 2007, when the elder Binay was mayor, and was finished in 2013 when his son took over.,Binay is the leading candidate for the 2016 presidential elections, where his rivals Cayetano and Trillanes of the Nacionalista Party (NP) are also eyeing higher office.,Contractor made Batangas property?,Binay again pointed to his critics when asked ,why Hilmarc\u2019s Construction Corporation was the contractor that won all 5 phases of the building,, and other buildings in Makati. Senators raised this as another \u201cred flag.\u201d,\u201cSiguro ho tanungin niyo rin siguro ang mga pamahalaan sa ,Iloilo Convention Center,, sa ,Taguig.Hilmarc\u2019s, din ang gumawa noon.\u201d ,(Maybe you should also ask other government units like Iloilo Convention Center, in Taguig. Hilmarc\u2019s was also the contractor.),The Iloilo Convention Center is a pet project of Senate President Franklin Drilon of the ruling Liberal Party (LP).,Binay just echoed the statement of his son that Hilmarc's won the bidding. \u201cBoss,, may proseso iyon. ,Either, may nag-bid, may nanalo sa ,bidding,, pero hindi porque siya nanalo, hindi nagkaroon ng tamang proseso, (Boss, there\u2019s a process there. Either someone bid and won the bidding but just because the contractor won, it doesn\u2019t mean it did not pass through the proper process).\",Binay dismissed the press statement of lawyer Renato Bondal that Hilmarc's was Makati\u2019s \u201cfavorite contractor\u201d because it supposedly constructed houses and farm facilities in a property owned by the Binays in Batangas, where the Vice President hails from.,\u201cAh hindi ko alam iyan eh at I think iyon hong pagiging ,favorite, ho doon kay ,Hilmarc, ay siya po ay nanalo ,through a process, ,(Oh, I do not know that and I think Hilmarc\u2019s being the favorite was because it won through a process).\",Binay likewise downplayed ,allegations of conflict of interest, between his son and Hilmarc's chairman of the board Efren Canlas, who is also an officer of Construction Safety Foundation, as Cayetano pointed out in the first Senate hearing.,The elder Binay said his son and Canlas were just together in the group but this did not automatically mean there was conflict of interest.,'APPLES TO APPLES.' Binay says the Makati building should not be compared to private buildings. Photo by Jonathan Vicencio/Office of the Vice President \n,\u2018Senate did no canvass\u2019,Binay also rejected the standards that the senator had used to determine that the building was overpriced. He said the value given by Cuervo Valuers & Advisory Inc was a mere \u201cmarket appraisal for a hypothetical building.\u201d,He also dismissed the Davis Langdon and Seah handbook that Cayetano waved and grilled auditors about. Binay even imitated Cayetano in waving the book.,\u201cThe handbook that Senator Cayetano is saying is not part of the process that COA follows in its study. That\u2019s not included.\u201d,To determine overpricing, Binay said the Senate should have conducted a \u201ccanvass\u201d of materials and supplies used, and do an \u201capple-to-apple\u201d comparison or compare the government building not with private structures.,\u201cNot once did the Senate do a canvass,\u201d Binay said.,Binay remained defiant, saying no case against him has prospered in court despite the numerous accusations, and long-running rumors about his family\u2019s corruption in Makati.,\u201cHanggang ngayon, wala pa silang maipakitang ebidensya na ,overpriced, ang, building., Uulitin ko: wala akong kaso sa ,Sandiganbayan (Until now, they cannot show evidence that the building was overpriced. I repeat: I have no case before the Sandiganbayan).\",Malaca\u00f1ang has, ,not outrightly defended of Binay amid the allegations, but Presidential Spokesman Edwin Lacierda said in a news briefing on Wednesday that as a member of the official family of President Benigno Aquino III, the Vice President ,still enjoys the trust and confidence of the President,., \u2013 Rappler.com, *$1 = P43.6", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/67411-binay-presscon-makati-building", "title": "Binay: Makati even \u2018saved\u2019 P200M from building", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130937-zamboanga-del-norte-jalosjos-assassination-try,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/nation/66589-worse-overpricing-makati-building-binay,http://www.rappler.com/nation/66756-coa-makati-building"},

Former national treasurer Leonor Briones says the next president will have to work with the 2016 and 2017 budgets crafted under the Aquino administration. ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 With only 22 days to go before election day, the 5 candidates for the presidency are busy with the final stretch of their campaigns, holding multi-city sorties, discussing with various sectoral groups, and promising ambitious projects and programs if they win the race to Malaca\u00f1ang., ,But former national treasurer Leonor Briones pointed out that whoever wins the presidency will have to work with the national budget created under the Aquino administration for at least two years.,The new president is set to take oath in July \u2013 7 months into 2016. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) announced in January that it has ,already released, 90% of the P3-trillion budget to government agencies.  ,Meanwhile,, budget preparations for 2017, has already started, and Congress is set to start its hearings by June. ,If the new president's campaign promises and new projects or programs are not in the 2016 and 2017 budgets, Briones raised concerns that this may mean committing unconstitutional acts.,\"They cannot touch the 2016 budget anymore because that's already committed. So if they say they [want to give] ,free lunches, to school children, how much is that? Is that budgeted for 2016?\" Briones said. ,She added, \"If it's not in the 2016 budget, the new president cannot do very much unless he does exactly what the preceding administration did \u2013 transfer funds and create savings.\",The same can be said for the 2017 budget, she said, because it has been prepared under the current administration's budget department, and will already be laid out by July.,\"The new president, even if he will oversee the 2017 budget, the 2017 budget is already made. The process starts in February. By July, it will be presented by the DBM, this [administration's] DBM,\" she said.,Briones is the lead convenor of Social Watch Philippines, which lobbied against the government's controversial Disbursement Acceleration Program. Critics said the spending scheme was unconstitutional because it allowed the executive to augment items in the budget, which is a function of the legislative branch.,In July 2014, the SC ,struck down 3 schemes ,under DAP as unconstitutional.,Of the 5 presidential candidates, Briones said that only two have so far made clear positions on lump sum appropriations: Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who said he ,wants to abolish the DAP, and lawmakers' pork barrel, and Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago, who has, rejected the redefinition of savings,.  ,Unawareness of budget,Briones said that the candidates' many promises to voters show that they do not understand the budget process and how they plan to fund their programs.,\"It shows a total unawareness of the budgetary implications of what their promises are. And this is why the voters are always disappointed for at least 2 years. ,Kasi hindi naman niya hawak 'yung budget na 'yan. Akala ninyo 2016 lang...ang 2017 nakalatag na rin 'yan ,(Because he or she does not hold the budget. You'd think it is only for 2016, but the 2017 budget is already laid out),\" she said. ,Among the candidates, the administration bet Manuel Roxas II may stand to gain from this if he wins, since the Liberal Party candidate's platform hinges on continuity of the programs under the incumbent's administration.,If the new president wants to push for his own priority programs, he or she will have to go through the bureaucratic process.,\",Kung opposition ka,, you'll really have to dismantle the entire budget...You have to bear in mind, the bureaucracy is still there. ,Ang papalitan lang naman political appointees eh,. You'll have to introduce a new concept para mapasok 'yung priority mo,\" she said. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Read more from this series:,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

Photo from Sen Lacson's official Facebook account  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Senators on Monday, November 21, questioned the excessive lump sum allocations in the proposed 2017 budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), amounting to more than P9 billion.,Senate President Pro-Tempore Franklin Drilon and Senator Panfilo Lacson criticized the agency for not specifying the programs and projects to be funded.,The 2017 budget of the DPWH, as passed by the House and adopted by the Senate \u2013 subject for approval \u2013 is P454.2 billion. It is up by 14% from this year\u2019s P397.11 billion. (READ: ,What's in the proposed 2017 national budget,),On Monday, Lacson first questioned the P500 million line item in the DPWH budget, as it is only described in the General Appropriations Bill as for the \"Central Office.\",\u201c'Yung mga allocation, except central office, walang itemization noong P500 million. So bakit 'yung iba meron; sa central office, wala?\", Lason asked. (There is no itemization for the P500 million. Why is it that the rest have it while the central office does not?),Senator Loren Legarda, sponsor of the DPWH budget, explained that the fund was meant to \u201caugment\u201d feasibility studies. But Lacson said there was already a P5.9 billion itemized line in the budget for such studies.,Legarda then said it is only a \u201cstandby fund\u201d for possible project needs. This did not sit well with Lacson and Drilon, who said lump sum funds are discretionary.,Drilon even likened it to the Priority Development Assistance Fund or pork barrel, which the Supreme Court ruled as unconstitutional.,\u201cAfter the budget is passed, it becomes the General Appropriations Act. The secretary of public works is authorized to identify where this will be spent. That\u2019s precisely what PDAF is all about. Isn\u2019t this what the SC struck down as unconstitutional?\u201d Drilon said.,Legarda still defended the budget, saying the agency needs a contingency fund in case of earthquakes. But Lacson pointed out there is a separate budget for that from the National Disaster Risk Reduction Fund.,Legarda replied, saying she was only giving an example. She went on to say that \u201cthere is really a need\u201d for the P500 million standby fund for \u201csoil analysis.\u201d,Lacson seemed unconvinced: But isn\u2019t the Department of Environment and Natural Resources the one capable of soil analysis?,Legarda said that while the DENR conducts the same, the soil analysis needed for infrastructure projects is different.,Lacson questioned another lump sum fund in the DPWH budget amounting to P150 million, which is again only identified as \"Central Office.\",\u201cAnother P150 million for feasibility study on top of the P5.9 billion and P500 million. ,Katakot-takot naman 'tong feasibility study na 'to,,\u201d, Lacson quipped. (Why so many many feasibility studies?),This time, Legarda said it is a contingent fund for flood control. But Lacson reiterated his question: ,\u201cNaka-itemize na ang feasibility study sa P5.9 billion, bigla na naman may feasibility study ulit sa central office.\u201d ,(The ones for feasibility studies are itemized under the P5.9 million, so why is there suddenly allocation for another feasibility study under the central office?),Legarda said the amount would be sub-alloted to the region and would then be submitted to the Senate before the budget\u2019s approval.,Right-of-way acquisition,Lacson was on a roll scrutinizing the DPWH budget, as he went on to question the P9 billion lump sum funds for the payment for the right of way acquisitions \u2013 P5 billion for \"various\" complete projects and P4.06 billion for \"ongoing\" projects.,\u201cSo kindly provide details,\u201d Lacson told Legarda.,\u201cThere are details. The funds allocated is even lacking for all projects needed to be done,\u201d Legard said.,But Lacson pointed out there is no specific list of the roads. Lacson also questioned why some provisions in the DPWH budget have specified the streets for right of way acquisition except for the two.,\u201cContradictons, Mr President. In others, identified\u2026 ,may location pero merong iba hindi indicated, central office lang nakalagay,.\" (In others, the streets are identified; in others, they are not indicated, only listed as \"central office.\"),Legarda, in response, said: \u201cIt is difficult to determine which streets. We are not certain which will be speedier, which will be approved by the owners (of the property).\u201d,She also said they would itemize the lump sum funds and submit it \u201cin the next few days\u201d before the budget\u2019s approval.,Lacson, before suspending his interpellation, jokingly told Legarda: ,\u201cHuwag kayo magalit sa 'kin, bati pa rin tayo.\u201d ,(Don't get mad at me. Let's still be friends.),Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III, upon calling the next senator to question Legarda, said in jest: \u201cThe sponsor has given up.\u201d,Lump sum questioned in House, too,In the House, similar queries plagued the DPWH budget, with Kabayan Representative Harry Roque questioning supposed \"appearance\" of substantial lump sum appropriations.,He said items under the National Road Network Services amounting to P1.079 billion were appropriated P25 million each, allegedly in the form of lump sums. \"Where is the exact location of this project?\" Roque asked.,Davao City 1st District Representative Karlo Nograles, chairman of the House committee on appropriations and an ally of President Rodrigo Duterte, claimed,these are not lump sum appropriations. (READ: ,Nograles: No lump sum in proposed 2017 DPWH budget,),\"These are items in the budget placed by the DPWH precisely to give them flexibility as these are mostly asset preservation,\" he said, similar to what Legarda mentioned in the Senate.,\"It is only within the course of the year that the DPWH will find out where these services are needed. You cannot identify these as lump sums. It is clearly identified where the funds will be spent,\" added Nograles. \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/153078-lacson-drilon-dpwh-2017-budget-lump-sum", "title": "Pork barrel?

Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, was the more successful, becoming a senator before almost winning the vice presidency this year.,However previous presidents had refused to allow the burial in the heroes' cemetery because of Marcos's crimes, so the family kept the preserved body in a glass casket at his home in the northern province of Ilocos Norte.,The family's fortunes changed with the election of Duterte, a longtime ally of the Marcos family, as president in May this year.,He said Marcos deserved to be buried at the heroes' cemetery based on the fact he had been a president and a veteran of World War II.,Duterte also said he owed loyalty to the family because his father served in the Marcos government and the family had helped fund his election campaign. ,\u2013 with a report from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/152813-ferdinand-marcos-heroes-burial", "title": "Marcos buried at Libingan ng mga Bayani", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/120166-federalism-pros-cons-explainer,http://www.rappler.com/nation/149496-supreme-court-decision-bury-marcos-libingan-bayani,http://www.rappler.com/nation/121436-ombudsman-upholds-charges-binay-makati-carpark-building,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/144587-fast-facts-libingan-ng-mga-bayani,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152818-marcos-family-arranged-private-burial"},

This was after she failed to pay her tuition on time.,Since the start of the semester, she had been appealing for late payment of her financial dues but had been repeatedly denied.,According to UP student regent Cleve Arguelles, it even came to a point when her mother knelt before UP Manila Chancellor Manuel Agulto to personally appeal their situation. (This was later denied in a ,press conference called by Agulto, on Monday, March 18.),The ,Philippine Collegian, quoted professor Andrea Bautista Martinez of the Department of Behavioral Sciences as saying the student frequented the Office of Student Services to seek counseling.,She killed herself a few days after filing a leave of absence on March 13. \"[,Pagkatapos niyang mag-file,],, nakapag-usap kami [sa text] at sinabi niyang malungkot siya at napakalaki ng epekto sa buhay niya at ng pamilya niya ng pag-LOA niya,,\" Martinez told the ,Philippine Collegian,. (After she filed a leave of absence, we texted each other and she told me how sad she was and how much her taking an LOA affected her life and her family.),Martinez was also quoted by the ,Manila Collegian, as saying, \u201cSince February, ,hindi na siya pumapasok. Lagi siyang nagte,-text ,sa \u2019kin na hindi niya kinakaya ang problema.\" ,(Since February, she has not been going to school. She was always texting me, telling me she couldn't handle the problem.),Unaffordable tuition,The UP system follows the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP) for tuition fee policies. With STFAP, students are categorized into 5 alphabetical socio-economic brackets \u2013 A, B, C, D and E. ,Students under Bracket A pay P1,500 per unit while Bracket B students pay P1,000 per unit. Brackets C and D students pay P600 and P300 per unit, respectively. Students categorized under Bracket E are exempted from paying tuition.,The student was categorized as a Bracket D student, paying P300 per unit, even if she had applied for a Bracket E bracket. She has since been appealing for a lower bracket since the STFAP results came out earlier this school year.  ,\u201cTaxi driver, na nga ang asawa ko, bakit Bracket D pa kami?\" ,asked her mother. (My husband is only a taxi driver, why are we categorized in bracket D?) Given a minimum wage of P456 a day, a worker in Metro Manila takes home about P13,680 a month. Assuming a full load of 21 units, Lorena would have had to pay P6,300 a semester. She is the eldest of 5 children.,The university evaluates applications and even conducts house visits at random to determine a student\u2019s appropriate bracket.,Repressive policies,UP Manila enforces a \u201cno late payment\u201d policy. In other words, students are required to pay their full tuition fee up front when they enroll. They can opt for installment payments but also need to be approved.,On October 23, the UP Manila administration released a memorandum barring students with unpaid accounts from being admitted to their classes. They eventually \u201clifted\u201d the memorandum and allowed around 50 students to attend their class.,UP Prof Carl Marc Ramota,, chairperson of the UP Manila Department of Social Sciences, posted photos of the memoranda on the matriculation of UP students.,However, with the strict implementation of this policy, students are issued notices to file a leave of absence (FLOA) if they fail to meet the deadline for payment of tuition.,In the case of Lorena, the UP administration on March 13 advised her to apply for a Forced Leave of Absence (FLOA). ,Besides appealing for late payment, she also tried to apply for a loan, sought installment payments, and promissory notes. All of these were denied by the administration.,Outraged UP community,UP students are condemning the UP Manila administration for their \u201cno late payment\u201d and \u201cFLOA\u201d policies.

{"content": "\nIf we are able to address the long-running problem of underdevelopment and violence in Mindanao, there is no reason why we cannot have peace, security and development in the rest of the country    ,It is imperative that we see a successful peace agreement as an opportunity and to at the least objectively look at its provisions and understand adequately the gains of pushing it and continued losses if we close our mind to it. Unfortunately, just like the previous attempts at really making peace and ultimately achieving development in Mindanao, a number have already started to shoot it down. Assuming that the agreement is really unacceptable, what are the points that make it unacceptable? What are the alternatives or, what could be done to make it acceptable? In other words, for those who oppose it, what alternative could they offer so that violence in the region finally ends and the longed for development actually takes place? ,The global and regional outlook could be in our favor,The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has now embarked at integration and the creation of an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the year 2020; this means free movement of goods and services. We are now in the year 2014 and therefore has 6 years remaining to prepare for the opportunities and threats that regional integration brings. Of course, opportunities outweigh threats if we go by the concept of integration, which means open market and therefore bigger market. Open market however, also means competition, and this is where losses may outweigh opportunities in our case. As has been raised in previous writings, our main problem in this country is politics, as it is the one that prevents setting up the right infrastructure and mechanism to promote production and distribution in the country.,Let's take agriculture as an example, a sector and or industry that requires scale. We are a country that is rich in natural resources and rich productive land, and even talented and hardworking people. The right environment for all these good ingredients to work however can only be provided by the government. Rightly, agriculture was decentralized in 1991 under the Local Government Code. But what this merely meant was the transfer of responsibilities at the local level; there was no transition nor was there adequate technical support provided to ensure that the local government can absorb the responsibilities the agriculture industry entails. ,The local government, being the one closest to the ground is the logical political and administrative entity that should be responsible for agriculture. Agriculture requires close supervision which should take into consideration not only the material and technical production requirements but most crucial is the local condition, local practices and circumstances of the farmers and related groups and organizations. The national government should always be ready to provide technical support, even material and capital support, and set the standard, but the local government is the logical entity that should be in charge of implementation.,On the other hand, what clearly prevents all these from happening is again the political conditions in the country. Our local governments simply do not have the adequate scale, the right size that could provide a dynamic political and economic environment. On average, our municipalities, even some cities, are only about a hundred square kilometers, which is roughly about the size of a village in other countries. We have 81 provinces compared only to 34 of Indonesia which is bigger than the Philippines. With the exception of Jakarta, a special district like our National Capital Region, the smallest province is Yogyakarta which is 3,133 square kilometers. Compare that with our Provinces, many with only less than 2,000 square kilometers, and a number are island provinces with an average of only 300 square kilometers.,And it keeps on counting. Cities used to be only about 80, has now ballooned to 144; and the reason why this is the case is not development, not the availbility of better public services that logically suggests urbanization, and thus qualification to be declared a city, but only because of greater share in the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA). The more we create local governments, the smaller becomes the jurisdiction of local authorities, the more will have to share from the same share in the IRA and therefore lesser money to spend for public services and ultimately, the more difficult it is for public administration. Issues like traffic and waste management transcend political boundaries and as it entails more transaction costs as individual local governments have to work together. Smaller political authorities mean less and less revenue, and less and less opportunity.,Amalgamation not fragmentation,The new Bangsamoro regional government is an opportunity for amalgamation, an opportunity to have a working model of a state that could allow us to imagine a federal Philippines where regions preserve and make the most out of their unique and rich identity. There is a good reason to believe this is a fresh and good start if we look at the interesting political structure they have set for themselves, that is the Ministerial Form, a parliamentary regional government. A parliamentary system is collegial, relying significantly on a working political party system. I can again imagine naysayers saying \"precisely we don't have 'real' political parties\" and thus we can't have a parliamentary system that will work. ,The good news is, regional political groups like the MILF and their erstwhile partner, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) have both embarked on political party building, anticipating the requirements of a new regional political dynamic. The point is, a parliamentary system provides an entirely new political environment that allows the development of programmatic political entities like the political party. Unlike the presidential system where the focus is on the individual political chief executive, promoting, entrenching personality driven politics, the new system shifts the focus on the political institution that is the political party. This point, based fundamentally on the principle of 'operant conditioning' requires a different piece consistent with the system approach mentioned in a piece also published here before.,Our concern here mainly is why the new regional entity can jumpstart and sustain regional and local development. The answer is two interdependent factors. One is that it is a regional government and one which is set to adopt a different system that potentially can arrest the degeneration that results from traditional politics caused mainly by personalistic politics. Not to sound biased but I can risk saying that the MILF appear to be more organizational than personal compared to the MNLF. It should not be taken to mean that the former is therefore superior than the latter. It should however mean that it merits a closer inspection and provides a model for political party building not only in the region but even in the country. ,We have so many political parties, but hardly can we choose one that actually operates in the real sense of it. Saying that also means there's much that MILF should be able to prove and work hard to convince that theirs is different and this effort would be more successful than the previous. More importantly, the MILF should be able to prove that this new entity is more inclusive and therefore addresses the main issue of secessionism in the country; and that is underrepresentation and being taken for granted if not used by the government.,Two, is precisely the Bangsamoro as an opportunity for amalgamation, at the least a good reason and opportunity for the provinces and other local governments to work closely, possibly work as one under the new regional entity. This point is interdependent on the previous because local governments have a reason to expect more from the regional government, more representation and therefore treated as a real stakeholder in the region and not just a tool of a person or a clan. The existing political organizations may still be consistent with the traditional model that is prevalent, but the new system as has been argued provides a new environment as it is an entirely different political game with different set of rules and dynamics.,Essentially, the new Bangsamoro political entity can potentially address the fragmented feature of our politics, or local governments in Mindanao especially. We may not be able to merge existing fragmented political entities in our provinces and municipalities and cities, but a working inclusive regional entity can do the trick of a more unified governance. Going back to the start of our discussion, Mindanao boasts of rich natural resources, not to mention, rich cultural history, sitting in a strategic location. ,If the still considerably agricultural land that it is, is made more productive than it is today, with its rich cultural heritage plus its picturesque environment and natural resources, then we are all set for ASEAN integration and even global competition. The bottomline in all these is, if we are able to address the long-running problem of underdevelopment and violence in Mindanao, there is no reason why we cannot have peace, security and development in the rest of the country.,After the formal signing, there's still a long way to go before we can see a Bangsamoro political entity. The Bangsamoro Transititon Commission (BTC) should work fast to allow enough time for a transition which doubles as a way to promote the new entity to the rest of Mindanao and convince the others to consider being part of the regional government. Would it not be good to have a bigger political entity close to you rather than rely on the traditional Imperial Manila? If the others can be convinced that this new entity will be significantly more progessive than ARMM, then there is enough reason to vote yes in the plebiscite creating and being part of a new regional entity. ,Meanwhile, the BTC should finish the draft organic act and for them to also start communicating with key members of both Houses of Congress. The key is to have your Champions in both Houses, more than the President who is expected to support. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Edmund S.

Photo by Paterno Esmaquel II/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 A university professor on Tuesday, October 20, filed the 3rd disqualification plea against presidential survey front runner Senator Grace Poe based on her certificate of candidacy (COC).,In a petition filed in his personal capacity, De La Salle University professor and political analyst Antonio Contreras said Poe isn't qualified to run for president in 2016 because of her \"failure to meet the 10-year residency requirement.\",Contreras wrote in his petition: \"It is respectfully prayed that this petition be granted and that the certificate of candidacy of the herein respondent, Mary Grace Natividad Sonora Poe Llamanzares, be cancelled on the ground that she made a material misrepresentation about her residency, where she lacks the 10-year minimum residency required by law and the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines to run for president.\" ,In an interview with reporters, Contreras said Poe disclosed in her COC that she would have resided in the Philippines for 10 years and 11 months by election day, May 9, 2016. ,\"That's not true,\" Contreras said, because Poe lacks 2 months and 9 days of residency in the Philippines. ,Contreras pointed out, too, that he focused on the residency issue since the Senate Electoral Tribunal ,is already tackling ,Poe's citizenship issue.

(In our opinion, the earlier we decided on these cases, the better for our elections, the better for our democracy.),This is the 3rd petition filed against Poe based on her COC. ,On Monday, October 19, former senator Francisco Tatad ,filed a similar petition,, and maintained that Poe is not a natural-born citizen as she has \"unknown parents.\",On Friday, October 16 \u2013 just a day after Poe, filed her COC, \u2013, ,lawyer Estrella Elamparo filed a petition, too, \"to deny due course to or cancel\" the senator's COC because of her allegedly false claims: , that she is a natural-born Filipino citizen and is also a resident of the Philippines for 10 years prior to May 2016. ,\u2013 ,Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

Valenzuela Representative Sherwin Gatchalian says education will be his primary legislative agenda if he gets elected as senator in 2016. Screenshot from Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Learning from lessons in his district, Valenzuela representative and senatorial candidate Sherwin Gatchalian said education will be his primary legislative agenda should he win a Senate seat in the 2016 elections.,\"When I was a mayor in Valenzuela, we put a lot of focus on education \u2013 basic education and also higher education. I learned a lot personally,\" Gatchalian said on Wednesday, November 11,, in an interview on Rappler's #TheLeaderIWant series.,\"When you work in the local government, you basically have daily exposure to public education, and this is where you learn the true problems of our nation.\",The problems back in Valenzuela are quite basic, he said: malnutrition, and the \"perennial\" shortages in classrooms and textbooks. ,Still, he supports the ,hotly-contested K to 12 program, and says the \"negative effects\" raised by critics are \"short term\" since the two additional years \"are really an investment for the future of our kids.\",Several groups opposed to the K to 12 have filed petitions asking the Supreme Court to suspend the program. They insist the national government should address shortages in basic education first before reforming the curriculum. ,But Gatchalian said there are 3 reasons why he is in favor of the K to 12 program:,The K to 12 program will be fully implemented in the Philippines by 2016 as the education department rolls out nationwide the two additional years of senior high school.,It is estimated, that about 1.2 million to 1.6 million students will enroll in senior high school in 2016.,Free higher education in PH?,Aside from his support for the K to 12 program, Gatchalian has also filed several education-related bills in Congress.,During his interview with Rappler, he talked about ,House Bill 5905, or the Free Higher Education Act, which already has the approval of the ,House committee on higher and technical education,.,The lawmaker said the country only needs P12 billion to make tuition fees free in all state universities and colleges (SUCs). He claims this is doable, considering it is only 0.04% of the national government's P3-trillion budget for 2016.,But while the chances are slim ,for the bill to be approved in the 16th Congress,, the senatorial aspirant said it's important to start the conversation on the bill since its enactment will result to a \"radical reform\" in higher education, and will increase student enrollment. ,This, in turn, will produce a skilled workforce that will allow the country to take advantage of its economic growth, Gatchalian said.,\"We want it to be talked about, especially during this time when the elections [are] just around the corner. You want it to be a campaign issue or a campaign agenda. I think that bill can really transform the education system here in our country,\" he explained.,Based on figures from the, Commission on Higher Education,, there are about 224 public higher education institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines. This number excludes 451 SUCs satellite campuses.,If HB 5905 is enacted, it will benefit an estimated 1.54 million students enrolled in public HEIs. ,Below are the other education-related bills filed by Gatchalian:, ,Gatchalian, is a member of the Nationalist People's Coalition, the party widely believed to be supporting the tandem of Senators Grace Poe and Francis Escudero.,He is an exclusive senatorial candidate of the Poe-Escudero tandem.

Former Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado testifies at the Senate hearing on the alleged overpriced Makati City Hall Building 2 on August 26, 2014.,MANILA, Philippines (2nd UPDATE) \u2013 The ally-turned-rival of Vice President Jejomar Binay told the Senate that the former Makati mayor earned from the allegedly overpriced Makati \u201cparking building\" but refused to give details. , ,Testifying at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, August 26, former Makati Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado said he and the Vice President \"benefitted\" from the building, while Senator Nancy Binay supposedly made the cakes for senior citizens of Makati which are claimed to be overpriced as well. (READ: ,From cakes to buildings, Binays overprice, 'chop-chop',), ,Mercado made the statement upon questioning from Senator Antonio Trillanes IV about the building allegedly overpriced by P2 billion ($45.67 million*)., ,Trillanes asked him pointblank, ,\u201cKayo ba kumita sa transaksyong ito? ,(Did you earn from this transaction?)\", ,Mercado said, \u201c,\u2019Di ako sinungaling. Pagtatawanan ako rito. Noong nagtanong pa lang kayo, tumawa na sila. Sa, phase 1 and 2,, nakinabang po ako.\u201d, (I am not lying. People will laugh at me. Actually, when you asked the question, people already laughed. In phase 1 and 2 of the building, yes, I earned from that.), ,Trillanes then asked if the Vice President also earned from the building., ,Mercado said, \u201c,Kung ang, vice mayor, nakinabang, aba'y siguro higit na nakinabang ang ,mayor, dito. Imposibleng \u2018di nakinabang ang ,mayor (If the vice mayor benefitted from it, then perhaps the mayor benefitted even more here. It\u2019s impossible that the mayor did not benefit from it).\", ,Senator Aquilino \u201cKoko\u201d Pimentel III, who is leading the investigation, then asked if Mercado had \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d on his statement. The former vice mayor said it was his \u201cautomatic conclusion.\u201d,Mercado affirmed his statement upon questioning of Senate Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano, who asked him if he knew for a fact that Binay earned from the project. \",Iyon po ang totoo. Iyon ang kalakaran, ang sistema, (That's the truth. That's the system).\",Yet in an ambush interview after the hearing, Mercado refused to say how much he or Binay earned, saying he will only give details \"at the proper forum\" like the courts to avoid his statements from being \"twisted.\" ,Asked if he was referring to money, Mercado told reporters: \",Depende,. ,Maraming bagay iyan eh especially nung nag-kandidato ako diba? Kung ako\u2019y tinulungan ng ,campaign materials, stage, etc., Hindi naman ibig sabihin pag sinabi mong pakinabang ay pera agad eh.\", ,(It depends. It could be many things especially when I was running, right? If I was helped with campaign materials, stage, etc. It does not mean the benefit is immediately money.) ,Pressed what he meant by ,pakinabang ,(benefits) in the context of the building, Mercado answered, \"Like I said, I will answer in the proper forum.\" ,The former vice mayor also clarified that he was not saying that the 11-storey building was overpriced. What he said was that based on the estimates and plan presented to him then for the first two phases of the 5-phase building, the cost was just P1.2 billion ($27.42 million) with one basement, a ground floor for a Land Bank branch and business permit and licensing offices, and 4 floors. ,\"'Di ako nagsasabi ng ,overprice., Hayaan mo ang ,COA (Commission on Audit), mag-,determine, kung mayroong ,overprice.\" (I am not saying it's overpriced. Let COA determine if there was overpricing.) , ,Mercado said he was a longtime ally of the Vice President since 1986, when Binay first became Makati mayor.  He, said he and Binay were so close they called each other brothers.,Mercado said they had a falling out when Binay did not fulfill his promise to field him as his successor as Makati mayor in 2010. Instead, the Vice President supported his son, now Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin \u201cJunjun\u201d Binay Jr.,Watch the ambush interview with Mercado here:,Mercado claimed an intermediary of the Binays said Binay\u2019s wife, doctor Elenita Binay was initially open to allow him to be Makati mayor but with a condition., ,\u201c\u2019Pare, payag na si Doktora Binay mayor ka, basta wala kang tatanggaling empleyado ng ,city hall,, wala kang babaguhing proseso.\u2019 [Ang sinabi ko] ayoko naman po ng ,rubberstamp., Mula noon, nagbago ang pakikitungo ni VP Binay sa akin.\u201d, ,(\"My friend, Doctor Binay agreed for you to be mayor for as long as you won\u2019t remove any employee of the city hall, won\u2019t change any process.\" [I said] I didn\u2019t want to be a rubber stamp. From then on, VP Binay treated me differently.),He added that the alleged overpricing would not have happened under his watch.,\",Kung ako ang naging mayor ng Makati, 101% isasagot ko sa inyo, hindi mangyayari ito,. ',Di ko po papayagan na ganito ang presyo na walang paliwanag. Baka ako pa magsasabi sa COA na i-check iyan kasi 'di tama.,\",(If I were Makati mayor, 101% I tell you, this would not have happened. I would not allow that price without an explanation. Maybe I would even be the one to tell COA to check that because it's not right.)   ,Mercado added that the ordinances and appropriations for Makati projects were questionable, usually made in lump sums without specifying the project. He added that councilors and officials were included in the names of those who approved ordinances, even if they were absent., ,Pimentel said he too had this observation about the lump sums., ,Trillanes said the statement should prompt the committee to discuss issuing an invitation to the Vice President to face the committee. Pimentel said senators will discuss the matter later.,Mercado also said it saddened him to have to speak against the Vice President, considering their long professional and personal relationship. Ernesto was a long-time city administrator of Makati when Jejomar Binay was mayor. ,He said \u201cprinciple\u201d and \u201cthe national interest\u201d were his reasons for breaking ties with Binay, and not just politics., ,\u2018Nancy makes Makati cakes\u2019, ,Mercado also implicated Binay\u2019s eldest daughter, Senator Nancy Binay, in the long-running rumor that cakes given to senior citizens of Makati are overpriced., , ,The former Binay ally said the cakes were a \u201cgood program\u201d of the city government, along with money for residents\u2019 burial. Still, he said it was an open secret in Makati who was earning from the cakes. He then pointed to the senator, who he said acted as the \u201ctechnical assistant\u201d of the elder Binay. ,\u201cAlam ng lahat ng taga-Makati na si ,Senator Nancy Binay, ang gumagawa ng ,cake, noong \u2018di pa siya senador.\u201d ,(Everyone in Makati knows Senator Nancy Binay makes the cakes when she was not yet senator.), ,Trillanes clarified the allegation, \u201cYou are saying people in Makati know Senator Nancy is the one making the cakes?\u201d, ,Mercado replied, ,\u201cOpo, (yes).\u201d, ,When Senator Vicente Sotto III asked Mercado if Senator Binay was the \u201cchef\u201d who baked the cakes herself, he responded that she supervised the process., ,In last week\u2019s hearing, another Binay political rival Renato Bondal claimed the cakes cost P1,000 ($22.82) each. The next day, the ,Makati City government said it only cost P306.75 ($7) each,. , ,Bondal, upon questioning of Sotto, now says the P1,000-price tag he had earlier placed on the Makati government birthday cakes to its senior citizens was just a \u201cguess.\u201d,Nancy: 'Not true' ,In a statement, Senator Binay denied the allegation and berated her father\u2019s former aide for \u201cabusing\u201d the Vice President\u2019s trust.,\u201cI deny in the strongest terms possible and condemn the malicious claim of former Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado that I have economic or financial interest in the supply of cakes for senior citizens at the Makati City Hall,\u201d she said.,On Mercado, she said: ,\u201cPinagkatiwalaan ng aking ama si dating Vice Mayor Mercado.

File photo by Edwin Espejo/OPAPP  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Communist guerrillas said on Monday, February 6, they are rejecting President Rodrigo Duterte's ,decision to scrap the peace talks ,and will work to explore the possibility of reopening negotiations. ,They reiterated willingness to silence their guns again through a more stable bilateral ceasefire agreement as the peace panels discuss their ,key reform proposals, and the release of political prisoners. ,\"The offices of the Negotiating Panel of the ,NDFP, shall remain open to continue to explore the possibility of reopening peace negotiations with the Duterte government, both on the ,CASER, as well as on the matter of a bilateral ceasefire simultaneous with release of political prisoners,\" the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) said in a statement.,The communist New People's Army (NPA) ,terminated its unilateral ceasefire, last week but argued then that talks should continue even as fighting resumes on the ground.,Senators and tribal groups based in areas affected by the conflict have also joined calls for the continuation of talks, fearful of the resumption of violence on the ground.,The National Democratic Front (NDF) is the political wing of the communist movement which represents the rebels in peace talks with the government. The CPP said they are still looking forward to the scheduled February meeting in The Netherlands. ,The CPP statement came on the same day that one of the communist leaders released last year for the talks was ,held ,at a checkpoint in Davao. The President earlier said the released rebels should go back to jail, but the NDF said the order has no legal basis for now. (READ: ,NDF: No basis to arrest released communist rebels,),'Compelling reason',Government chief negotiator Silvestre Bello III said there remains an \"opening,\" citing Duterte's pronouncements that he may still change his mind about scrapping the talks if there is a \"compelling reason\" to do so.,\",Mayroon naman siyang, (He mentioned a) ,collatilla,. If there is a compelling reason, [he may change his mind.] That is an opening,\" said Bello in a phone interview. ,What could a compelling reason be? The government's chief negotiator said he will not speculate.  ,\"What is compelling to him, I don't want to speculate on that. What I can assure you is he really wants peace for the country,\" Bello said.  ,The CPP called on the public to push for the continuation of talks. ,\"They must demonstrate that there is no more 'compelling reason' than the growing clamor for justice and just peace,\" it said.,Grand gesture from NDF needed,Former Ateneo School of Government Dean Antonio La Vi\u00f1a said the public should wait for Malaca\u00f1ang to define what Duterte meant when he said he is scrapping the talks. Is he merely suspending it? Or is he also abrogating agreements made under previous administrations?,La Vi\u00f1a said the current situation may require a \"grand gesture\" on the part of the communists in order to change Duterte's mind.,\"To solve the impasse, the NDF may have to give this early one big concession,\" he added.,La Vi\u00f1a said it is also important that both the military and the New People's Army (NPA) reinstate a ceasefire through a joint deal that will establish monitoring mechanisms. He acknowledged that this will take tiime. ,He said it is difficult to advance the peace talks when there is fighting because deaths will be a setback to any progress they may make on the negotiating table.,If the NDF is going to press for the release of the political prisoners before a final peace deal, La Vi\u00f1a said they will have to give more. ,\"If their condition is release of prisoners, they must do something reciprocal as well. A ceasefire does not favor any party and is good for both. It's not a concession of the NDF in exchange for the concession of a ceasefire. That is asymmetrical,\" he said. ,Senators, civil society groups support talks,Senators also called for the continuation of the talks, joining local politicians and tribal groups based in areas affected by the conflict.,The President's party mate, Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, said talks could still continue. \"I hope that the suspension of the peace talks is also temporary and will be resumed in due time,\" he said in ambush interview on Monday.,Senator Ralph Recto said both sides should understand that peace talks remain the best way to end the insurgency that has plagued the country for nearly 5 decades.,\"It is perhaps time to be reminded of lessons from an insurgency which has lasted almost half a century. One is for government to realize that guns alone will not defeat an insurgency with deeply rooted social causes. And rebels must explore the prospect that more concessions can be won on the negotiating table than on the battlefield,\" Recto said.,Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV said the communists should \"surrender\" the rebels who allegedly used 76 bullets to kill 3 soldiers in Bukidnon, the incident that reportedly triggered Duterte to terminate the government ceasefire. ,\"While peace is the ultimate goal, parties must come to the table in good faith. Only then can we end this conflict and, finally, build a path toward prosperity for our poor countrymen,\" Aquino said.  ,Tribal groups in Northern Luzon and Mindanao are afraid of the resumption of violence.,\"Even if the 6-month ceasefire was unilateral by either side, it managed to bring relative peace to our communities. This, we wish to make permanent through a bilateral ceasefire and the eventual signing of a peace agreement,\" said the ,Manguangan, Dibabawon, and Mandaya tribes in a joint statement.,The Northern Luzon Peace Network expressed the same fears. \"We are fearful now of the violence that will revisit many communities in Mindanao, Northern Luzon, and elsewhere, particularly those occupied by indigenous peoples. We are afraid of innocent civilians being caught in the crossfire between the government and rebel forces,\" it said in a statement.,Cagayan de Oro City Mayor Oscar Moreno, head of Region 10\u2019s Peace and Order Council, said he was saddened by the developments.,\u201cWe all should never forget that insurgency has grown because of the inability or failure of the government to bring basic services to our people especially those who need these services the most,\u201d Moreno said.,Moreno won the prestigious Galing Pook Award for effectively addressing communist insurgency in Misamis Oriental where he used to serve as governor. He was credited for successfully transforming a conflict area \u2013 Sitio Lantad in Barangay Kibanban \u2013 into a farming community where former rebels have taken the helm of a cooperative. ,\"The most effective way tool to combat insurgency is to bring the government closer to the people,\u201d Moreno said.,Misamis Oriental Governor Yevgeny Emano is also concerned that the resumption of violence would affect their economic gains.  \u201cI fear that my tourism programs will be affected, aside from that, the people\u2019s livelihood will be affected and they will be displaced again,\u201d Emano said.,Bilateral ceasefire agreement,Duterte scrapped the talks after the NPA terminated its ceasefire. He slammed the killing of soldiers while the ceasefire was still in place. ,But the CPP lamented how Duterte is \"favoring\" the military and the police.,\"Duterte echoed the exaggerated anger of the ,AFP, over the outbreak of successive armed skirmishes between the New People's Army and the ,AFP, resulting in the death of 6 ,AFP, troops since the end of January,\" the CPP said.,\"He glosses over the fact that it was he and the ,AFP, hierarchy that have ordered the forward deployment of armed troops in the guerrilla zones and bases of the ,NPA, to occupy barrios in the guise of 'peace and order', 'delivery of social services', and other pretexts, and to sow fear and intimidation among the people and carry out armed offensive operations despite the reciprocal declarations of unilateral ceasefire,\" the CPP added.,The military and the NPA were able to hold separate unilateral ceasefires for a period of 5 months. But the situation grew untenable because both camps accused each other of abusing the ceasefires.,The communists pushed for a scenario where talking will continue even as fighting resumes on the ground. While this was done in past administrations, the government panel noted how talks have collapsed because of encounters in the field.,The government has aggressively pushed for a bilateral ceasefire agreement that will put in place common rules for the military and the NPA. ,\u2013 with a report from Bobby Lagsa/Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/160622-communists-explore-reopen-talks", "title": "CPP willing to explore reopening of peace talks", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/nation/139042-robredo-federalism-questions,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/nation/160498-duterte-scraps-peace-talks-communists,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/159053-peace-talks-social-economic-reforms"},

No such thing. The commission does not issue clearances of the nature or the tenor that was described,\u201d Tan told the Senate blue ribbon committee., ,The Binays have been citing a COA memorandum prepared by resident auditor Cecilia Caga-anan that stated there was no \u201cadverse finding\u201d from Makati City Audit Groups on the alleged parking building., ,Yet Tan clarified that it was just an \u201cinternal memo.\u201d, ,\u201cIt is still being evaluated by the Central Office, by us, and I would say that at this stage, this is just a report subject to evaluation along with all the other pertinent documents and papers,\u201d Tan said., ,Tan said the COA central office is doing a \u201cspecial audit\u201d on the building., ,Tan\u2019s comment prompted Senator Antonio Trillanes IV to criticize Mayor Binay.

The Ombudsman is independent, whether or not we have finding, it\u2019s up to the complainants to file a case.\u201d, ,Trillanes: Why only 20 days?, ,Trillanes also chided COA auditor Caga-anan for issuing the memorandum when she said she only relied on the work of technical audit specialists and could not vouch for the data herself., ,\u201c,Ang daming, red flags, dito pero panay hugas ng kamay.

Agency proposals for ongoing and existing programs and projects will be evaluated separately from new ones, so as to decongest and systematize the decision-making process. ,Budgetary requirements for ongoing and existing programs are due at the end of the month under Tier 1. Meanwhile, new spending proposals are due in April under Tier 2.,These new proposals will be based on spending areas and strategies to be determined in the Budget Priorities Framework (BPF).,\"The BPF will be issued soon in a separate national budget memorandum. It will contain the fiscal space,\" Abad said.,The fiscal space is the difference between the national budget ceiling and the estimates of how much ongoing projects and programs will cost.,These spending proposals will then undergo scrutiny by the Sub-Committee on Program/Project Appraisal and the Development Budget Coordination Committee (which is composed of the DBM, the Department of Finance, the National Economic Development Authority, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the Office of the President). The proposals will be appraised based on relevance, impact, implementation readiness, and sustainability.,\"Throught his approach, we are able to identify clearly which projects need to be completed/or expanded. We are able to prioritize projects and therefore maximize the fiscal space,\" Abad said. ,Infrastructure priority,Among the guidelines of the 2017 Budget Call is for agencies to prioritize funding for strategic local infrastructure projects, such as arterial, provincial roads and bridges, ports, and airports. According to the press release, provincial, arterial, and farm-to-market roads are to get the bulk of infrastructure investment in 2017 as all construction and upgrading of national roads and bridges are set to be completed  this year.,Abad earlier said fiscal transfers to local government units through Bottom-Up Budgeting (BUB) and KALSADA (Konkreto at Ayos na Lansangan at Daan Tungo sa Pangkalahatang Kaunlaran) are to substantially increase in 2017.

It is seeking a budget of P458.61 billion ($9.48 billion) next year, a 15.49% jump from this year's P397.11-billion ($8.21 billion) budget.

He cited the difficulty of hitting the 2022 target for infrastructure spending of 7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) due to the problem.,\"The chair has asked for the new programs regarding absorptive capacity and the response that the chair got is early procurement activities and early awarding of contracts upon the receipt of allotments,\" said the Camarines Sur 1st District Representative.,\"Thank you very much for that candid answer but truth of the matter is, that has been the practice of the past two administrations so the concern has yet to be answered,\" Andaya added.,Public Works Secretary Mark Villar said the absorptive capacity of the agency is currently at 50% but there are efforts to improve on this.,The proposed P458.61-billion ($9.48-million) budget of the DPWH is intended to fund the country's \"most ambitious infrastructure program\" in 2017.

Photo from Grace Poe's Facebook page,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 \u201cGood governance saves lives.\u201d,Speaking at the Asian Forum on Corporate Social Responsibility on Tuesday, September 2, Senator Grace Poe stressed the need for government intervention before, during, and after disasters. She said this is \"a prerequisite to national resilience.\",Poe called on Filipinos to look at the local governments of Albay and San Francisco of Camotes Island for inspiration. These two are often visited by typhoons, yet are known for their ,speedy recovery,.,The senator praised Albay\u2019s transformation into a \u201cdisaster resilient\u201d LGU through community-based efforts and through the leadership of Governor Joey Salceda. (READ: ,Lessons from Albay after Yolanda,),San Francisco, made headlines when it reported zero casualty after Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). The town boasts of its \u201c,purok,\u201d system \u2013 developed by former Mayor Alfredo Arquillano Jr \u2013 which ensures everyone\u2019s participation in disaster preparedness.,The ,barangay, is the smallest form of government, but it is further divided into ,purok,s. In the system, each ,purok, has a leader and a committee in charge of disaster risk reduction, hence making community organization easier and faster. Poe added the citizens should be able to trust the government, especially during evacuation operations.,She considers Filipinos' optimism as both boon and bane. \u201cOur optimism helps us bounce back, but our high tolerance for lousy service and corruption disables us from having foresight for what\u2019s best for the country.\u201d,Disasters, FOI,Poe wants the entire country to replicate and institutionalize the best practices of Albay and San Francisco. How? \u201cCreate a separate national disaster response and management agency, enact the Freedom of Information (FOI) law,\u201d she suggested.,She wants an independent agency with its own experts, budget, and system.,\u201cOur current set-up is inadequate, although they\u2019re doing their best. Make the NDRRMC distinct from the Department of National Defense,\" she said.,Poe also stressed the need to scrutinize government transactions through an ,FOI law,. \u201cWe can have many useful programs if the government spends its money wisely,\u201d she said, and cited the fertilizer fund scam and the PDAF cases as examples.,She argued that an FOI law can also push officials to perform better since government agencies will have to make their archives accessible to the public.,Hungry Pinoys,Poe also discussed the importance of food security in achieving national resiliency.,\u201cThere can be no national resiliency without ,food security,,\u201d the senator said. \u201cEveryone should be able to afford proper nutrition.\u201d (READ: ,On nutrition and disasters,),She argued that if only farmers can get adequate support, the country would not have to depend on ,rice imports,. \u201cPoor post-harvest facilities lead to ,food wastage,,\u201d she added.,\u201cIt\u2019s daunting to be a farmer. You\u2019re at the mercy of nature and of politicians,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of you are averse to government dole-outs, but at this point, we really need to give farmers a boost.\u201d,Poe suggested improving ,farm-to-market roads,, facilities, irrigation, incentives and cooperatives. And again, she said, under an FOI law, the public \"can scrutinize what the government is really doing for farmers.\u201d,Poe is also pushing for a national school feeding program. In the ,existing system,, the Department of Education (DepEd) provides a feeding program for malnourished elementary school students, while the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) targets preschoolers. ,Poe\u2019s bill,, however, proposes free lunch for all public school students, from kindergarten to high school.,\u201cWe won\u2019t have a productive workforce if they\u2019re not properly nourished. I urge you to support the bill.\u201d,She added that the 2015 budget for Deped\u2019s and DSWD\u2019s school feeding programs are already in place. \u201cWe need to be optimistic, but also vigilant.\u201d,Poe consulted the Deped, the National Nutrition Council, schools, and the private sector in crafting her bill.,Private sector, MRT,Poe also suggested that the government can learn a lot from the ,Corporate Social Responsibility ,(CSR) programs of the private sector.,\u201cWe can learn how they do simple, cost-effective programs; unlike the government where it\u2019s bureaucratic,\u201d she said.,Poe highlighted the private sector\u2019s potential in becoming the \u201cmain driving force which can propel our country to inclusive growth and sustainable development.\u201d She asked the government and the private sector to work together.,\u201cCSR programs compliment government programs, or even fill its gaps,\u201d she said.,At the Asian Forum, an Indian businessman asked Poe on her thoughts on India\u2019s new law requiring companies to allot 2% of its earnings to CSR programs.,\u201cI feel that we\u2019re already overtaxed,\u201d Poe replied. \u201cTo encourage the private sector to do CSRs, the BIR should acknowledge money spent on CSRs. The government shouldn\u2019t impose how businesses use their money. We shouldn\u2019t burden our businesses anymore; instead, provide more incentives so businesses can contribute more in nation building.\u201d,She also expressed support for Senator ,Sonny Angara\u2019s bill, seeking to reduce income tax rates.,\u201cOur biggest barriers? Bad policies and corruption. Clich\u00e9, but true. Our public transportation system is quite depressing,\" said Poe, who ,rode the train last week to check its state,.,Poe said that better MRT operations can help boost workers\u2019 productivity, hence making a \u201cripple effect\u201d on the entire economy. She also linked the Manila port congestion problem with the inefficient transportation system in the country.,\u201cThe congestion of Manila goes back to our problem in transportation. Businesses won\u2019t set up in an area if there are no proper public transportation systems. Government should step up on infrastructure to decongest cities and to entice people to move,\u201d she explained.,At the end of the forum, Poe answered several questions ranging from disasters to transportation. One question, however, drew more noise from the crowd. \u201cWhen will you run for national office?\u201d asked Washington Sycip, a Ramon Magsaysay Awardee and founder of the Asian Institute of Management.,\u201cI still have a lot to prove and learn.

UP Manila Chancellor Manuel Agulto says administrators wish even bigger dreams for UP Manila students. Photo by Paige Occe\u00f1ola,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 (UPDATED) No guilt.,UP Manila Chancellor Manuel Agulto told a press conference on Monday, March 18, they did everything they could to help Kristel Tejada, the 16-year-old freshman who ,committed suicide, last week, reportedly over failure to pay tuition on time.,(Rappler initially named her \"Lorena\" to protect her identity. But since she has already been named by UP officials, we are using her real name as well.),He turned emotional in the press conference but said, \u201cMy outburst was because I remembered how hard it was for me to get my medical degree. As far as guilt is concerned, ,wala, (none).\u201d,Although the university issued its October 23 memorandum indicating a \u201cno late payment\u201d policy, they gave students with financial difficulty special consideration.,\u201cWe do not wish to give anyone a difficult time. We dream for them as they aspire for their future. As administrators we are not enemies. I would like to consider myself as a surrogate parent to our students, faculty and staff,\u201d Agulto said.,He added, \u201cWe do not wish to pose obstacles in realizing their dreams. In fact, we wish even bigger dreams for them. We always want to work with our students because we were once like them.\u201d,Vice Chancellor Josephine de Luna, who signed the memo said, \u201cthere were 79 appeals for late payments that were approved from the period November to December 2012. So it was really extended for students who were requesting for late payments.\u201d,Agulto emphasized that a leave of absence (LOA) is not a penalty imposed on students unable to pay on time. He said that a LOA is provided for \u201cofficially unenrolled\u201d students so that they can resume schooling in the next school term, as was the case for Tejada.,The university also had to follow due process., ,Due process,UP President Dr Alfredo Pascual justified their denial of Tejada\u2019s appeal for late payment and for re-bracketing under the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP).,He explained that upon her enrollment in UP Manila, Tejada was categorized under STFAP Bracket D. This means that she is required to pay P300 per unit plus miscellaneous fees.,Her total assessed fees as of the first semester of school year 2012-2013 amounted to P9,172.50. She was able to pay this by availing of a student loan amounting to P6,377 and by paying the partial amount of P2,795.50 upon her registration.,To be relieved from paying her student loan, Tejada appealed for a re-bracketing to a lower STFAP bracket on Sept 27, 2012. However, Agulto noted that she failed to submit the requirements needed for the appeal to be processed for the designated period. ,Extension,During the registration period for the second semester, Tejada\u2019s father requested for an extension to settle their outstanding loan. ,UP Manila administration heeded their request and moved the deadline from October 31 to Nov 20, 2012 under the condition that they pay the full tuition amount and miscellaneous fees for the 2,nd, semester upon registration.,Tejada was granted a total of 3 extensions for the payment of her student loan. These were dated November 30, December 7, and December 19.  Tejada was finally able to settle her student loan on Dec 19, 2012 and was able to get another loan form.,Agulto also noted that Tejada only appealed for late payment of her tuition fee on January 23, or 9 weeks past the deadline set for the semester.,Improving financial assistance,Pascual acknowledged problems and constraints plaguing the current STFAP system. These include:,Pascual said that the school administration is currently reviewing proposals to reform the STFAP application process. One of the most cited criticisms against STFAP is the tedious process it involves. To address this, reducing the application form from 14 pages to no more than 2 pages has been proposed.,Pascual said that STFAP requirements such as financial and family background will also be integrated into the application form for admission. House visits, he added, will still continue, but will be done by random sampling. Among the proposed changes to the system is an increase in the monthly allowance of students in the lowest bracket.,By fast-tracking applications, Pascual said that from 6 months, processing should be reduced to two months. This will pave the way for earlier announcements of STFAP brackets and the acceptance of appeals for re-bracketing, if any. They also hope to improve data on the family income of students applying for financial assistance to make sure that those who need it most get the financial aid.,According to the UP president, he had actually started reviewing the STFAP process as early as he assumed his post. The review process, he said, was not a reaction to the suicide incident. ,Meanwhile, the faculty and staff of the Department of Behavioral Sciences of UP Manila issued a statement on Monday, March 18, expressing their sympathy for Tejada's family. They also pinned the blame on Chancellor Agulto and Vice Chancellor de Luna and urged the two to resign as a sign of \"their ,solidarity and humility to the aggrieved family of Tejada.\" Below is the full text of the statement: ,UP Manila Department of Behavioral Sciences Statement on the Death of Kristel Tejada,\u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/33-editors-pick-moveph/24087-up-manila-chancellor-no-guilt", "title": "UP Manila Chancellor: No guilt", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/22242-lookback-growing-pains-for-promising-up-crew,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130937-zamboanga-del-norte-jalosjos-assassination-try,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/23894-up-student-kills-self-unpaid-tuition"},

Negotiators of the government and the communist National Democratic Front of the Philippines are in Rome for the 3rd round of peace talks. Photo from OPAPP  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Negotiators representing the Philippine government and rebels behind Asia\u2019s longest-running communist insurgency began in Rome difficult talks on proposals to radically reform the country\u2019s social and economic policies in hopes of addressing poverty.,The hardest part of the negotiations begins. It will require painful compromises from both camps, if the talks are going to be successful under President Rodrigo Duterte.,The peace talks also need widespread public support or risk suffering the fate of peace deals that were only rejected in the end. The deals will require passage of new laws in Congress and amendments to the 1987 Constitution.,Land reform, national industrialization,The National Democratic Front (NDF) envisions to draw a roadmap to providing more jobs, looking out for the welfare of the working class, improving the economy and, ultimately, making the country capable of standing on its own without aid from the US and Japan, in particular. (READ: ,Duterte's talks with NDF: The meat of the matter,),Land reform and national industrialization are the two key issues the two panels began discussing in Rome and will be the focus of meetings to be held in Manila or in neighboring countries in the succeeding months. (READ: ,PH, NDF make significant headway in talks despite clashes,),The NDF is pushing for new policies to spur an agricultural revolution nationwide. It wants to break up plantations that escaped earlier laws on land reform, and then distribute them to farmers who will be given generous government support to ensure that they earn profits. The New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), could find a new role as enforcers and implementors of agrarian reform. ,The NDF is also proposing policies to ease out foreign firms from key industries, particularly mining, while shifting government priorities to pour money into developing the country\u2019s own capability to extract its rich natural resources and process them into finished products. It believes in the country's potential to be a global player in the steel industry, for example.,These are capital-intensive ventures that the NDF said could be financed by, among others, reducing military spending and imposing higher taxes on the rich. ,Ban US forces, review trade agreements,This is not all. The NDF wants to ban US military forces in the Philippines at a time when the two countries are ,implementing a new agreement, allowing the military superpower to build facilities inside Philippine military bases. ,It wants to review international trade agreements for possible amendments, suspension or termination. It wants to ban open-pit mining, monocrop production for export, and logging for export.,All these, among others, are detailed in the September 2016 NDF draft for the talks on the Comprehensive Agreement on Socio-Economic Reforms or \u201cCASER.\" Rappler obtained the 18-page draft from the NDF.,CASER is the jargon that represents the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the peace talks, the agreement that is supposed to address the root causes of conflict. It is the second of the 4 substantive agenda or themes to be negotiated before a final peace deal is achieved. ,If CASER talks succeed, the armed struggle is supposed to end. CASER is the reason why the government has agreed to release political prisoners and the rebels agreed to an unprecendented ceasefire \u2013 to make the environment conducive for the difficult talks ahead.,But critics of the NDF proposals have dismissed them to be ,utopian and thus unrealistic,, casting doubts on the talks that have been on and off for the last 3 decades. ,The panels will have to prove them wrong.,Finding the middle ground,  ,ROAD TO COMPROMISE. File photo of chief government negotiator Silvestro Bello III (right) and NDF panel head Fidel Agcaoili in Mindanao. File photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler ,The government panel said the talks will be successful under the leadership of Duterte, a former student of CPP founder Jose Maria Sison who serves as NDF's chief political consultant.,Duterte had referred to himself as a socialist and has turned the US into a punching bag while warming ties with China and Russia. ,But the devil is always in the details.,Separate interviews with Duterte's chief negotiator, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III and his counterpart in the NDF, Fidel Agcaoili, before CASER talks started in Rome show differences on how the two panels intend to implement these policies.,\"They have their own version and we have our own. We have to blend,\" Bello told Rappler.,The questions are: How far is Duterte willing to meet the rebels on these issues, and is the NDF willing to give up some demands in order to reach a compromise?,This is the difficult task that the Norwegian facilitator of the talks, Ambassador Elisabeth Slattum, reminded the two panels during the 3rd round of talks in Rome. ,\u201cA peace process is not a zero-sum game where you have one winner and one loser. A successful peace process is one where both parties come out on the winning side. Neither side will be perfectly content,\u201d Slattum said.  ,\u201cBoth sides will have to make painful concessions along the way. And both sides will have to show a great deal of courage because some of the decisions that they will have to make will not be popular,\u201d Slattum said.,Sison's wife, Julie de Lima, leads the NDF in the CASER talks. She faces veteran government negotiator and former agrarian reform secretary Hernani Braganza, and human rights lawyer Efren Moncupa. ,The challenges are compounded by government policies that the rebels oppose  and an ambitious timeline that they have imposed upon themselves. (READ: ,War on drugs, Marcos revival hurting talks \u2013 NDF,),The two panels agreed they could complete talks on CASER within the year. The NDF also demanded the  immediate implementation of agreed reforms \u2013 the implementing laws should be passed, for example \u2013 before it could sign a final peace deal.,Land reform,The rebels rejected the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform (CARP) law signed into law by the late president Corazon Cojuangco Aquino and later extended by his son, former president Benigno Aquino III,  because of provisions that allowed plantation owners to escape distribution by converting agricultural land to real estate, sugar land, and land for export crops. ,Key to their contention is the continued tension in the distribution of Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac that was run by the Cojuangco-Aquino family. It is one of the sugar plantations that Agrarian Reform Secretary Rafael Mariano, one of the ,nominees of the NDF, to the Duterte Cabinet, declared he will audit to make sure that farmers really own and occupy the land distributed to them. (READ: ,Agrarian reform chief 'Ka Paeng': Hope for the farmers,),\"The essence is destroying the structure of feudalism so that peasants can be liberated from serfdom and allow them to earn their own income so they become consumers of finished products made by local industries,\" Agcaoili told Rappler.,Bello acknowledged that certain issues will be difficult. \"For example, they would advocate for free distribution of land. That is not possible. That is not land reform. We have to negotiate that,\" he said. ,Bello said free distribution of land may be possible if it involves land owned by the government. \"When you talk about arable land owned by land owners, you cannot do that. It will be confiscatory.\",National industrialization, ,The NDF also wants the country to take control of running key industries, particularly mining. \",Imbes na hinahayaan mo ang Amerikano, (Instead of allowing the Americans), Canadians, and now the Chinese, to get our natural resouces and bring them ,sa kanilang bansa, (to their countries) because they need it for their industries. And then they sell us whatever [end product they produce out of it],\" said Agcaoili. ,\"Why can't we do that? The moment we can do that, we offer jobs,\" he added.,Critics of the NDF find this proposal extreme, citing the lack of funds and local expertise to develop very technical industries such as mining.,Agcaoili argued this is precisely why the Philippines should focus on developing foreign partnerships that will facilitate technology transfer and will agree to help the Philippines develop its own capability. He cited how China supposedly purchased old steel mills \u2013 importing it lock, stock, and barrel \u2013 to grow its steel industry to now become one of the world's biggest.,Bello said the proposals have been studied and there are \"approaches to this proposition,\" but he did not elaborate.,Key to this, Agcaoili added, is the need to veer the Philippines away from its traditional trade allies, or ending treaties with the US while grasping \"other opportunities\" offered by BRICS countries Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.,\"I don't think it will be a difficult issue after we have listened to our President's position\" said Bello.,But it is easier said than done. The local big players, who may have the capability to develop these industries, are the same oligarchs that the rebels are protesting against because they are not necessarily the most responsible ones.,Public support,The panels know the peace talks cannot be confined to the negotiating table. The general public will ultimately have to support the final peace deal between the Duterte government and the NDF. (READ: ,Norwegian facilitator 'cautiously optimistic' about PH, NDF talks,),\u201cThe peace process needs the patience, support, and involvement of the Filipino people,\u201d said Slattum. ,Slattum brings into the talks her experience in peace negotiations between the Colombian government and FARC rebels that led to a historic peace deal meant to end the longest-running armed insurgency in the West. Colombian voters, however, ,rejected, the Norway-facilitated peace deal, which had to be renegotiated before it was ,ratified, by the Colombian Congress.,The proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which was meant to implement a final peace deal between the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), suffered a similar fate earlier. What should have been Aquino's legacy of peace crumbled when lawmakers rejected the BBL following public outrage over the death of elite cops in a ,poorly executed operation, inside MILF territory. ,It will benefit the talks if negotitators heed these hard lessons. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/159053-peace-talks-social-economic-reforms", "title": "PH, NDF talks: Both sides need to make painful compromises", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/158112-duterte-ndf-talks-meat-of-matter,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159488-ph-ndf-peace-talks-rome-closing-progress"},
{"content": "\nDoes Senator Grace Poe want to be president? Like her father in 2004, she may have to first win the vote of the Supreme Court.    ,FAMILY PHOTO: A young Senator Grace Poe with her father Fernando Poe Jr and mother Susan Roces ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 History may repeat itself in the Philippines should Senator Grace Poe decide to seek the ,presidency in 2016,. The circumstances of her birth may become the subject of legal questions in the run-up to the elections \u2013 reminiscent of the court battle that her father Fernando Poe Jr (FPJ) faced in the 2004 presidential polls. ,Is a foundling like her a natural-born Filipino citizen and thus eligible to seek the post? ,She was ,stateless,, said the camp of 2016 front runner Vice President Jejomar Binay, because the citizenship of her real parents are not known.,FPJ, on the other hand, was born out of wedlock. The petitioner ,said he acquired the citizenship of his American mother at birth because his father \u2013 a Spanish-turned-Filipino citizen \u2013 did not acknowledge him in his birth certificate. ,The Supreme Court (SC) favored FPJ's candidacy, but the decision did not come until March 2004 or two months before the polls., ,Will the issue also distract Grace Poe\u2019s campaign? Will the gods of Padre Faura favor her candidacy? ,\u201cLegally speaking, it could go either way from a technical point of view,\u201d a lawyer who has publicly supported arguments in favor of Poe's natural-born Filipino citizenship told Rappler. ,\u201c,If Binay has the votes in the SC, he could swing a disqualification. But the court will also think twice if political consequences are damning.\u201d ,Lawyer Harry Roque, a known supporter of Binay, told Rappler he can also argue the case either way \u2013 the protection of the interest of the child versus the constitutional intention to limit certain government posts to natural-born citizens because \u201cthey are bound ,to be loyal to this country.\u201d,That she acquired ,American citizenship, later in her life further complicated the issue because of claims she will not meet another qualification: the 10-year residency requirement.,Binay may ,distance himself, from the issues hurled by his men against Poe, but it will only take one petitioner to prompt what is expected to be a legal callisthenics. ,Legal process: Comelec, SC, Senate,TOP SENATOR. Senator Grace Poe topped the 2013 senatorial elections. It's the first time she ran for public office ,Ateneo School of Government dean Antonio La Vi\u00f1a said it should be a straight forward case: \u201cProcedurally, the Comelec could decide by December and the [High] Court by March. Beyond that, I think the court might hesitate and treat this as a political question as it would be too disruptive to our political process.\u201d,Whatever the outcome, legal challenges follow a process. Petitions against FPJ were filed before the Commission on Elections after he filed his Certificate of Candidacy (COC) and later elevated to the SC.,Former Comelec Chairman Sixto Brillantes Jr, FPJ's former lawyer, said Poe will go through the same process. ,\u201cIt will be the same case filed against FPJ \u2013 material misrepresentation in the COC when he claimed to be a natural-born Filipino citizen.\u201d ,Comelec Chairman Andres Bautista refused to comment because it's ,premature, until she files her COC \u2013 due in October \u2013 and a formal petition is filed.,But Roque said it can be raised now before the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) because lawmakers also have to be natural-born Filipino.,This scenario may get the issue out of the way sooner. ,But the chairman of the SET is SC Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, who in 2004 voted against FPJ's qualification.,Carpio said the burden of proof belongs to the candidate. ,\u201cAny person who claims to be qualified to run for president because he is, among others, a natural-born Philippine citizen, has the burden of proving he is a natural-born citizen,\u201d he wrote in his ,dissenting, opinion.,Carpio argued that FPJ was also unable to prove that his known Filipino father was his real father, which he said is important to verify in case of an alien mother.,Rights of illegitimate children, foundlings,Legal challenges against FPJ and Grace Poe are emotional issues \u2013 both involved the rights of illegitimate children and foundlings.,FPJ was born in 1939, and his ,case required scrutiny of laws spanning the Spanish Occupation to the American Colonial Rule. The court voted ,8-5 to alllow FPJ's candidacy, but the ruling was not conclusive. D,ocuments that could have shown, among others, if his father acquired Filipino citizenship before or after he was born were missing. Many government documents were destroyed during the World War II.,\"While the totality of the evidence may not establish conclusively that respondent FPJ is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, the evidence on hand still would preponderate in his favor enough to hold that he cannot be held guilty of having made a material representation in his certificate of candidacy,\" read the majority ruling.,It quoted constitutionalist Joaquin Bernas, who argued that the illegitimacy is irrelevant to public office. ,\u2013 Joaquin Bernas on FPJ's citizenship,He was  one of the ,Amicus Curiae, (friends of court) consulted by the justices.,UN convention,Grace Poe's case is much easier to resolve, argued Brillantes, because the court will not have to scrutinize as many laws. It only has to decide the rights of foundlings.,\u201cThis is easier. There is no question that she was found here, ,di ba,? Because she was born here in the Philippines, the presumption is her real parents are Filipinos,\u201d Brillantes told Rappler.,La Vi\u00f1a raised the ,1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, to argue in favor of this presumption. ,\u201cWhat are the rights of foundlings and children under our law? I say very strong \u2013 their best interest is always promoted in the Constitution and in many laws,\u201d he argued. (READ: ,In Iloilo, Grace Poe finds new clues to real parents,),\u201cThe Comelec would have to do the fact finding and establish the facts of how she was found. This is crucial because if it is true that she was left in the cathedral on the day she was born, that proves that mother was in Iloilo that day. One can conclude many things from that fact alone,\" La Vi\u00f1a added.,Roque disagreed. He said there is no question foundlings are granted Philippine citizenship. But a process need to be performed to perfect the citizenship, meaning they are not citizens at birth unless they can show that their real parents are Filipinos.,US citizenship and residency,COUNTER-ATTACK. United Nationalist Alliance interim president Tobias Tiangco presents a copy of the certificate of candidacy of Senator Grace Poe during the 2013 elections. Photo by Rappler  ,What United Nationalist Alliance interim president Tobias Tiangco raised about Poe\u2019s residency is another matter. He said ,she can't run for president or vice president in 2016 because ,she will not meet the minimum 10-year residency, requirement.,For Brillantes, Poe's ,residency is immaterial because being a natural-born citizen means she has been residing in the Philippines since birth.,Roque, however, said this is what makes Poe's legal hurdles, \u201cat least twice more difficult to hurdle\u201d compared to FPJ\u2019s. ,\u201cWe know that FPJ\u2019s father was Filipino and he (FPJ) was never a foreign national. In her case, we don\u2019t know who her natural parents are and she really became a foreign national,\u201d Roque said., ,Poe wrote in her COC in the 2013 elections that she had been a Philippine resident for 6 years and 6 months. It should mean \u2013 Tiangco argued \u2013 that in 2016 she shall have been a resident for only 9 years and 6 months., ,Poe said she ,\"err[ed] on the side of prudence\", when she wrote the date in her COC, but that the count should start from February 2005 when she decided to stay in the Philippines for good.,Poe got support from legal experts, who cited a case involving Imelda Marcos, which they said settled the issue through the ,animus revertendi ,doctrine \u2013 \"with ,intention to return. ,\"The intention to return to your place of origin is the basis of residence, and not actual, physical residence,\" said La Vi\u00f1a.,Roque said the doctrine doesn't apply because, unlike Marcos, Poe was a US citizen. The count should begin from the date she renounced her US citizenship, which Poe said was \"sometime October 2010.\" ,Poe's political rise,In 2004, FPJ would lose the tight race to Gloria Arroyo, amid allegations of systematic cheating. He died later in the same year, prompting Grace to come home from the United States. ,Poe's politial rise has been exponential since she first entered government as chairman of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board. Surveys show ,she may be the only one who can offer Binay a real challenge,.,Should she respond to the surveys, w,ill the Supreme Court stop her in her tracks?

The TV host has filed a temporary protection order against ex-husband James Yap after  he reportedly made sexual advances to her in her own home. Photo from 'Kris Aquino.Net' Facebook page,MANILA, Philippines - Television host and actress Kris Aquino has filed a temporary protection order (TPO) against her ex-husband James Yap whom she accuses of making unwanted sexual advances to her in her home and of inflicting psychological harm to their son 5-year-old son Bimby.,Inquirer.net, reports that the TPO filed from a Makati court will grant protection to Aquino and her son for 30 days from its issuance. But the petition, prepared by Aquino\u2019s counsel (law firm Chavez, Miranda, Aseoche), wants the protection order to be made permanent.,The petition asks the court to order Yap to keep a distance of at least 100 meters from her, Bimby, and any member of their household. By the power of the TPO, Yap is also forbidden from visiting her residence, work place, Bimby\u2019s school or any place frequented by mother and son.,The petition recounts the time the basketball player had visited Kris\u2019s condominium unit in December 2012 to pick up his son as part of their twice-a-week visiting arrangement. He then entered Aquino\u2019s bedroom and made \u201covert sexual advances\u201d to Aquino which she resisted. Her rejection drove Yap to \u201cutter mean and malicious statements.\u201d,According to the petition, all of this happened in the presence of their son who had even positioned himself between his parents and had told Yap to leave the room and \u201cstop hurting\u201d his mother. He also begged Kris to \u201ctell him to go away.\u201d,The incident traumatized the boy who, the petition said, has shown signs of being upset and highly agitated whenever in the presence of his father or when he hears his voice on the phone.,The petition notes that the incident was made possible \u201cby the unfettered access of respondent Yap on the household and persons of the petitioners.\u201d,Aquino and Yap\u2019s marriage was officially annulled last year.

Vietnam, which used to be at the bottom of the list, has caught up with the Philippines in the latest report.,The amount the Philippine government allocates to road projects has been growing each year. In the 2016 budget, a total of P277.02 billion ($5.89 billion) was alloted for roads and bridges. This is about three times the budget for roads in 2011. ,Budget experts say a big part of the problem may be attributed to the administration's failure to spend budgeted funds. The Aquino administration ,has been missing its spending targets over the past years,. ,Meeting growth targets,Barely 5 months to go before President Aquino's term ends, Budget Secretary Abad says the national government is making sure that infrastructure projects are implemented on time to meet growth targets in 2016. ,This includes the implementation of the KALSADA program, which is seen to improve road transport, and spur trade and tourism development.,KALSADA is a provincial roads rehabilitation program being implemented in at least 73 provinces,, according to a list obtained from the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG),.,The national government will spend P6.5 billion (US$ 135.87 million) as approved in the 2016 General Appropriations Act. Funds will be downloaded through the Local Government Support Fund. (READ: ,DBM allots P6.5B for road projects in 2016,),\u201cThis is not about giving LGUs substantial amounts of funds. This is about strengthening the capacity of LGUs to implement projects and improving governance at the local level,\u201d Abad said.,The budget chief said these transfers are only awarded to LGUs that meet conditions of good governance.,These conditions, include compliance with the DILG's Seal of Good Financial Housekeeping and submission to the DBM's Local Public Financial Management Assessment Report.,Barangay BUB,Aside from servicing only cities and municipalities, the BUB program will be expanded to the barangays, set to cover all 42,036 barangays nationwide in 2017, as announced by Abad.,\u201cBottom-up budgeting\u201d is a program under the Aquino administration where local groups usually led by civic society organizations consult with the community and pick from a list of projects to implement.,The Barangay BUB will provide P1 million ($20,905) subsidy to each barangay to aid poverty reduction plans and basic services delivery. Next year, some, 12,000 barangays will receive funding from the national government to pilot the program.,Since BUB was initially rolled out in 2013, 1,590 city and municipal LGUs enjoyed the program. A total of 42,221 projects have been funded from the 2015 allocation of P20.9 billion ($436.91 million), of which 13,712 have been completed as of December 1, 2015.,For this year, the national government allocated  P24.7 billion ($516.55 million) from the national budget, to service 14,325 BUB projects from 1,514 cities and municipalities,.,According to DBM, the participatory budgeting program for 2016 will be providing P20 million ($418,361) for a priority reduction program proposed by a city or municipality.,\u201cBy enabling LGUs to provide basic social services, improve disaster preparedness, and build local roads, we will make them better partners in sustaining the growth momentum,\u201d Abad said. ,\u2013 with Gemma Bagayaua Mendoza / Rappler.com,US$1 = P47.81", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/119155-lgu-higher-bub-kalsada-funding-2017", "title": "Higher budget for provincial roads, infrastructure in 2017 \u2013 Abad", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/sona/2015/100542-aquino-administration-underspending-fiscal-performance,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/budget-watch/955-open-roads/118397-74-provinces-kalsada"},
{"content": "\nWhat is at stake in the peace talks is the economic future of the country    , ,NDFP Peace Panel chairperson Fidel Agcaoli has labeled this the \u201ccrux\u201d of the peace process. Indeed, the resolution of the age-old problems of chronic poverty, gross inequality and underdevelopment is at the heart of the 48 year old communist-led revolution. An agreement that addresses these issues will be the agreement that will shape all past and future agreements. It will be the key to resolving the armed conflict.,In this round, the burden of proposing alternative solutions to the country\u2019s myriad of social and economic problems falls on the NDFP. They are, after all, the ones who have been fighting for radical socio-economic reforms to the extent of taking up arms against the government. More than providing a critique of past and existing economic policies, the NDFP is  expected to present a set of concrete and doable policy reforms that will lead not just to a prosperous but a just economic system for the country.,NDFP\u2019s robust proposal,A peek at the NDFP\u2019s draft agreement certainly points to this effort. It is a truly comprehensive document, 84 pages long and counting, covering practically all aspects of the economy. It is composed of a preamble and six main parts, the most substantial being Part III on \u201cDeveloping the National Economy,\u201d Part IV on \u201cUpholding the People\u2019s Rights,\u201d and Part V on \u201cEconomic Sovereignty for National Development.\u201d ,The document paints a stark assessment of the current socio-economic situation, traces the worsening problems of underdevelopment, mass poverty and social inequity to the neoliberal economic framework of the last three and a half decades, and proposes a radically different, nationalist and socialistic model of development to be jointly pursued by both sides.,Among the key reforms proposed by the NDFP are: ,The robust proposal from the NDFP actually adopts a number of proposals from the National People\u2019s Summit held in June 2016 that presented a 15-point \u201cPeople\u2019s Agenda for Change\u201d to both the GRP and the NDFP.,Sure to applaud the NDFP\u2019s proposal are the marginalized and impoverished classes and sectors in Philippine society who stand to gain from such sweeping policy changes. Expected to vehemently oppose are those tied to oligarchic and foreign interests who have much to loose in terms of economic and political clout.,The GRP\u2019s desired outcomes,PEACE TALKS. The government and the NDF held the second round of talks in Oslo October 6-10, 2016. File photo courtesy of OPAPP ,In contrast, the GRP has proposed a generalized set of \u201cDesired Outcomes\u201d to include the following: ,No details were given as to how the desired outcomes would be achieved. These could very well have been lifted from any policy paper churned out by the neoliberal-oriented technocrats in the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) or undergraduate students in the UP School of Economics.,The great debate,In the last round of talks last October, both panels were able to come up with a common outline for CASER which basically merged the outline of the NDFP\u2019s draft agreement with the GRP\u2019s list of desired outcomes (see Annex A of the October 9, 2016 GRP-NDFP Joint Statement). But there is much work to be done and acrimonious debates are expected before a final agreement is forged, hopefully within the year. Even as the talks progress, both sides are expected to continue consulting with stakeholders to further refine their proposals at the same time generate public support for their positions.,The government side will, of course, insist that there is nothing inherently wrong in its existing social and economic policies and that problems of poverty, inequality and underdevelopment can be solved by simply implementing current neoliberal, market-oriented policies at a faster and more efficient manner. The government\u2019s official response to any challenge to its economic dogma is to say that on the contrary, we liberalized our economy too little and too late. ,Just like previous governments, the Duterte administration aims to further open up the economy to foreign trade and investments, privatize public assets and utilities, and remove all constraints on private businesses. In other words, allow private (ideally foreign) capital to rule and relegate government's role to keeping the peace, ensuring the rule of law, and providing safety nets for the poor.,The NDFP, on the other hand, rejects neoliberalism, repeatedly points out its failures even in advanced capitalist countries, and offers a diametrically opposed framework for development. It will insist on developing local, Filipino-owned industries, massive public spending for development, greater government control over the economy, and comprehensive programs for wealth redistribution and social welfare.,The GRP will probably concede on some items \u2013 like increasing wages, ending contractualization or lowering income taxes. But they will resist key proposals on limiting foreign investments, the nationalization of key sectors, genuine agrarian reform and the re-establishment of state-run enterprises and utilities.,Many may not be aware of it, but what is at stake in the peace talks is the economic future of the country. The implications of CASER will be felt not only by constituents of the NDFP but by all Filipinos. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ,Teddy Casi\u00f1o served as the partylist representative of Bayan Muna for 3 terms, from 2004-2013.

Albay Governor Joey Salceda says focus now should be on rebuilding typhoon-hit areas. Here Salceda speaks to Rappler reporters and editors 19 Nov 2013. Photo by Rappler/KD Suarez,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It's time to move on. \",Tapos na ang cycle for self pity, (Let's end the cycle of self pity).\",With massive reconstruction and extensive rebuilding needed after Super ,Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), Albay Governor Joey Salceda said ,it is time the affected communities \u2013 in fact, the entire country \u2013 get on track now, starting with what we have.,The governor of perhaps the most disaster-prepared province in the Philippines spoke to Rappler reporters on Tuesday, November 19. ,Eleven days after the monster typhoon wiped out a number of villages, displaced hundreds of thousands, and affected millions, mostly in the Visayas, ,he suggested 5 steps toward rebuilding: ,1. Get relief to the people \u2013 fast.,When it comes to relief distribution, the government should make it like how blood circulates in the body \u2013 systematically and fast.  ,Salceda said we have the resources to get relief to all who need it, if only their deployment is well-planned and coordinated. (According to data from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, at least 22,730 personnel, 1,285 vehicles, 77 seacraft, 110 aircraft, and 27,237 \"assets\" have been deployed in the aftermath of the typhoon.),It's also important to clear the roads of garbage and debris to make transportation of goods faster and easier.,2. Have a national conductor, but let locals move.,At the moment, the country needs an \"orchestra conductor\" on a national scale, someone who can coordinate relief efforts on a macro level. But when it comes to local mobilization, it is important to respect the supremacy of local government units (LGUs).,\"No mayor, vice mayor, or councilor died during the storm,\" Salceda said, so it should be easy to revitalize the LGUs down to the barangays and make them work while minimizing political division., ,Do a cluster approach \u2013 dividing the tasks between clusters makes coordination easier and the people on the ground more efficient. Such an approach also offers flexibility.,\"Kung ayaw ipadaan [ng donors] ang pera sa amin (LGUs), puwede nila gawin, pero di sila makikipag-duplicate. May sense of coordination sa local.\", (If donors don't want to give the money to us LGUs, they can do that, but they shouldn't duplicate what we're doing. There should be a sense of coordination with the locals [where they should channel that].),Having a cluster overseeing particular needs of the victims helps in easily mapping out which areas are in need of specific goods \u2013 food, water, clothes, etc. \u2013 and making sure that the victims get enough of each.,3. Give victims money, not food.,Rebuilding a community will surely take time and funds. However, starting early with the victims can go a long way. \"Instead of giving them food, give them money,\" Salceda said. Commerce is set to follow once there is money being circulated in the region. This also gives them the option to choose what to eat and the power to spend.,It is also important to rebuild basic infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. In effect, these can restore human dignity to residents in the affected areas. ,Don't prolong the use of tent cities \u2013 they can be dehumanizing. Instead, invest in better constructed housing units like bunk houses.,Rebuilding what was lost is also not enough. \"We should be building back better elsewhere,\" he said, since now is the perfect opportunity to build a resilient society in one of the country's poorest nations. (,READ: Lessons: How Indonesians dealt with their own tsunami tragedy,),4. Hold a pledging session to raise $14 billion.,How much do we need for reconstruction? Based on past past disasters such as Pepeng and Ondoy, he said, $14 billion.,With that much money needed, he suggested a donor pledging session, where all international organizations and foreign governments that wish to help in reconstruction can signify their donations.,The money will not only be spent on reliable infrastructure but on livelihood and a viable ecosystem for sustainable community life. ,The people affected by the typhoon should not depend on one of their region's top products \u2013 the copra. Replanting coconut trees and waiting for them to grow and bear fruit will take about 6 to 7 years.,Instead, they can rehabilitate their agriculture by planting fast-growing crops like abaca, camote, corn, rice, and bananas. This will help them in creating a new livelihood.,5. Build more durable infra \u2013 on higher ground., ,Learn from history. Leyte, for example, was wiped out by storm surges twice in history \u2013 in 1898 and 1912. Rebuilding infrastructure in the same areas that were destroyed by the storm only puts people in vulnerable state., ,Instead, build new and better, durable infrastructure in areas that are 12 to 15 meters above sea level where people will be safe from flooding., ,Salceda said: \"Now is the chance for a new city, a new Tacloban.

Magdadagdag ka ng gastos doon,,\u201d Binay told reporters after a speech in Makati on Wednesday, July 23.,(There are houses made of wood, those made of concrete. Those would not have the same price. The same goes for buildings. And a building, even in government, has what we call variations, changes in expenses while you construct it because you see for example the soil is soft, etc. So there will be variations and additional cost.),He added, \u201cThere are T-shirts in small, medium and large. Those have different prices because some are colored. The price will change if you add designs. The same goes for buildings. In Makati, we only make high-quality structures like schools and hospitals. Our hospitals are the best ones supported by local governments.\u201d,Asked if he was saying that the building was just expensive but not overpriced, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t see how it can be viewed as expensive. That makes the difference between overpriced and expensive.\u201d,The Vice President spoke a day after lawyers and political opponents ,filed a plunder case against him and his son, before the Ombudsman for what was supposedly \u201cthe most expensive parking building in the country.\u201d Binay was mayor of the country's financial center for 21 years, succeeded by his son in 2010. ,Binay questioned the complainants\u2019 use of figures from the National Statistics Office (NSO) to claim that the building was priced 6 times higher than what should be the actual cost of P245.6 million ($5.67 million).,\u201cThe Supreme Court said this overpricing, it cannot be determined by the NSO. You have to ask around, go out and compare prices.\u201d,Yet when asked for his basis for determining the final price of the building, Binay cited the statement of his son that the structure has yet to go through a final Commission on Audit (COA) investigation. \u201cThey even preempted the COA. The COA has yet to finish its report. Their complaint came too early.\u201d,The complainants though also included the COA auditor of the city government in the case. ,CONTROVERSIAL BUILDING. The Makati City Hall Building 2 is just like any office building with parking floors, the Makati City government says on Twitter. Photo from Makati City government Twitter page,City office, not just parking building,Father and son clarified that the building is not just for parking but is used as an office of the Makati City Hall.,\u201cYou have to factor in so many things: cost of construction. There is a building management system, elevators, aircon because there are offices there, there are people working inside. This is not just a parking building,\u201d the younger Binay said. ,In a statement, Makati City Administrator Eleno Mendoza Jr said the 12-storey building consists of 5 floors of parking spaces and 6 floors of office spaces.,Calling it a \u201cgreen building with its green architectural design,\u201d Mendoza said the city government wanted \u201cto ensure the strength and stability of the building, which stands on an area with soil type classified as \u2018soft soil,\u2019 board piles and steel sheet piling were used for its foundation.  It also has granite tile flooring, centralized airconditioning, two elevators, conference rooms and mini-function halls, and other modern amenities.\u201d,The administrator said the building houses offices like the Makati Action Center, Makati Anti-Drug Abuse Council Office, Office of Senior Citizens Affairs, Information and Community Relations Department, Department of Environmental Services, Museum and Cultural Affairs Office, Tourism Office, and Redemption Center of the Public Safety Department.,Mayor Binay said this showed that the complainants \u201csimplified\u201d the issue. He and his father said the construction went through bidding and the proper process but could not give details and the documents yet as of press time.,The mayor said, \u201cWhat they are saying that this only costs P7,000 ($161.75) per square meter, that is just for low-cost housing. You cannot build something like this if we do not allocate the proper amount. It\u2019s impossible to make this building spending only P7,000 per square meter. There is no ghost project. You can go to check the building.\u201d,Citing NSO statistics, the complainants said the building only cost P7,691 per square meter but the price soared to P48,859 ($1,128) ,per square meter. ,VALID PRICE? Makati Mayor Junjun Binay says the NSO figures the complainants cited can only afford low-cost housing, not the 12-storey Makati City government office. Photo by Ayee Macaraig/Rappler,\u2018National figure behind complaint\u2019,In the interview and in a speech before the ,Financial Executives of the Philippines (FINEX) and the Management Association of the Philippines (MAP), Vice President Binay stressed that the complaint was all politics.,\u201cWe have been informed that this time around, our local opponents have been provided with the needed resources, financial and otherwise, by certain national interest groups, particularly a group of lawyers closely identified with a national personality,\u201d the elder Binay said.,Asked if he was referring to a politician from a city near Makati, Binay said, \u201cNevermind. They know who they are.\u201d,Binay said the motive of his opponents was to make him believe that Malaca\u00f1ang was behind the case to draw attention away from President Benigno Aquino III\u2019s ,impeachment complaints,. Yet he said he will not think ill of the President and fall for the trap to make them fight.,The leading candidate for the 2016 presidential polls laughed when speculating on the goal of the complaint.,\u201cLumabas ang aking 41% [sa survey], dumagdag pa ako 40 to 41%.

It was delayed by 2 hours because of disagreements on the language of the joint statement. ,The government panel also committed that they will facilitate request for the United States to remove Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Maria \"Joma\" Sison from its list of international terrorists to ,allow the leader of the revolutionary group to finally come home,. ,Sison, who participated in the talks in Rome, was absent at the closing ceremony. He was hospitalized Tuesday night, January 24, but is recovering well, said Ambassador Elisabeth Slattum, the Norwegian facilitator of the talks, during the ceremony.,CASER, CAPCR,A key development is the signing of ground rules for discussions on the Comprehensive Agreement on Socio-Economic Reforms (CASER).,Considered the \"heart and soul\" of the peace process, it envisions a roadmap to end widespread poverty in the Philippines by overhauling the country's social and economic policies. The NDF is pushing for the free distribution of land, for example. ,The government also submitted its draft on the Comprehensive Agreement on Political and Constitutional Reform (CAPCR). The NDF seeks to be a partner of President Rodrigo Duterte in forming his proposed federal republic. ,CASER and CAPCR are the 2nd and 3rd, respectively, of the total 4 substantive agenda to be completed before a final peace deal is achieved.,The first substantive agenda, Comprehensive Agreement on Respect on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL), was signed in 1998. Talks have been on and off for the last 3 decades.,The NDF said it sees the possible completion of CASER and CAPCR talks within the year, the shift to a federal system by 2018, and the signing of a final peace deal by 2020 after the successful implementation of CASER and CAPCR. (READ: ,NDF not ready to sign peace deal before 2020,),The Comprehensive Agreement on End of Hostilities and the Disposition of Forces (CAEHDF) is the final stage in the peace process. ,Bilateral ceasefire deal,The panels failed to sign a bilateral ceasefire deal, which the government panel wanted to accomplish in Rome. It was originally scheduled for signing in October 2016 but it was repeatedly deferred because of delays in the release of 400 political prisoners. ,But the NDF agreed to discuss the bilateral ceasefire deal next month, February, in The Netherlands after initially refusing to even calendar the issue. ,Governent chief negotiator Secretary Silvestre Bello III believes that this development means both sides will hold the 5-month-old ceasefire \u2013 which the NDF threatened to withdraw \u2013 despite the clashes in Makilala, North Cotabato over the weekend. ,\u201cOtherwise, what\u2019s the idea of discussing a bilateral ceasefire?\u201d Bello said. Besides, he claimed that the lifting of the ceasefires because of the firefight in Makilala was never mentioned. ,Bello argued the North Cotabato clashes underscore the urgency of signing a bilateral ceasefire agreement. ,The military claimed they were running after an armed group extorting from local businessmen and didn't know they encountered communist guerillas in Makilala. The NDF said the military was really hunting down communist rebels. ,The proposed bilateral ceasefire deal imposes common rules for the military and the NPA in order to avoid misencounters on the ground. It will define hostile acts and determine buffer zones, for example.   ,Joint Monitoring Committee,The negotiators also activated the languishing ,Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) ,that is supposed to monitor and investigate human rights abuses of security forces and communist rebels.,They signed supplemental guidelines that will make the JMC fully operational, thanks primarily to funding from Norway, the third party facilitator of the talks. ,The JMC is a mechanism under the first substantive agenda of the peace talk, the CARHRIHL.,Rights group Karapatan claimed reporting up to 4,000 human rights violations committed by state forces since the administration of President Gloria Arroyo. ,JASIG,The 2 panels decided to discuss the bilateral ceasefire deal in The Netherlands next month because they will really need to be there to deposit the identification documents of 87 rebel leaders who are to be covered by the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG). ,These 87 rebel leaders will be immune from government arrest. ,The list may only be opened when one of the names in the list is captured in order to verify that he or she, being an NDF consultant, should be released. ,Bello will be able to verify that the NDF deposited actual list of names of its members in the underground.

President Benigno Aquino III signing into law the P2.606-trillion budget for 2015. File photo by Rappler  ,While the government\u2019s revenue and expenditures have seen steady increases since 2010, fiscal deficit has been decreasing since 2012. (READ: ,Gov\u2019t underspending narrows deficit to 0.6% of GDP in 2014,). A fiscal deficit is calculated by subtracting the expenditures from the revenues.,A lower fiscal deficit might sound good if you are an ordinary person.,In the case of government, however, economists say a lower than target fiscal deficit could mean the administration is unable to make use of the money collected from its citizenry to provide services and build better infrastructure. ,Underspending has been cited as the reason for the ,deceleration of economic growth,. (READ: ,PH to miss 2015 economic growth target - economists,),Further, inability of agencies to spend budgeted amounts could also result in bloating \u201csavings\u201d \u2013 which could give the administration too much leeway in deciding where unspent resources go according to a former budget secretary.,Improved spending?,In a ,press release,, DBM secretary Florencio Abad said \u201cour spending levels from January to March show a very clear trend towards faster government spending. On first glance, spending in the first quarter may seem unremarkable, but the fact that it accelerated sharply by March gives us good reason to be optimistic.\u201d,However, according to data from the ,Bureau of Treasury (BOT),, while spending did increase in March, the government\u2019s spending has actually slowed down at the end of April, even gaining a fiscal surplus wherein revenues or earnings exceeded expenditures by around P53.6 billion.,Month,Government revenues (in millions of pesos),Government expenditures (in millions of pesos),Fiscal surplus/deficit (in millions of pesos),January,166,652.00,173,124.00,-6,472.00,February,132,772.00,142,445.00,-9,673.00,March,171,106.00,188,478.00,-17,372.00,April,209,104.00,156,505.00,52,599.00,May,242,525.00,175,188.00,67,337.00,*Based on data from the ,BOT,The Department of Finance (DOF) released a ,statement citing revenue growth as the reason, for the smaller deficit. In total, however, the government only collected around P471 billion which is P13.6 billion below the programmed revenue for the first quarter.,Meantime, in total, P504 billion was spent in the first quarter of the year, 4% higher compared to the first quarter disbursements in 2014 but still P78 billion below target.,According to the national government\u2019s ,fiscal program,, the government is set to have a total fiscal deficit of P283.7 billion by the end of 2015. As of the end of May, the government has P86 billion in surplus in total.,The problem with underspending,Former budget secretary Dr. Benjamin Diokno said in an interview with Rappler that the underspending results from DBM providing government agencies with more money than they actually need or are able to spend.,\u201cI think the administration is deliberately making the budget bloated because they want to keep the savings,\u201d Diokno said.,According to data collected by Rappler from ,DBM, and ,Bureau of Treasury (BOT),, the government has been on an upward trend since the presidency of Gloria Arroyo.,Expenditures have also been on the rise but ever since 2006, there has been a gap between the budget and expenditures. To date, the gap was at its largest last year in 2014 where the budget was at P2.268 trillion while expenditures were at P1.981 trillion., ,According to ,data from the DBM,, the government had almost P280 billion in unobligated balances at the end of 2014.,This is money that the DBM had allotted but the concerned agency had not spent, becoming savings for the next fiscal year.,\"Too late the hero\",The DBM says the structural weakness of national government agencies and governance commissions is the primary cause for underspending.,To improve the bureaucracy's ability to spend budgeted amounts, the Aquino initially employed what it called the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) early during its term. ,The DAP was supposed to ramp up spending in order to accelerate economic expansion. It was introduced ,to increase government spending after \"sluggish disbursements\", that resulted in a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3.6% in 2011. ,Following the controversy over the pork barrel funds, however, the Supreme Court, struck down several features of the DAP ,as unconstitutional in mid-2014. This means the administration needs to explore other ways to accelerate spending.,In March 2015, as part of the government\u2019s efforts to solve these structural weaknesses, President Aquino signed, Administrative Order (AO) 46,. The order is a directive to the heads of all government departments and agencies to \u201cimplement measures to facilitate budget execution.\u201d,First, the order requires earlier submission of requirements such as project listings, release of allotments, and implementation plans to the DBM. In terms of compliance, the DBM reported that it has released a lump sum of P30.9 billion to the agencies.,This closes the gap with the missed disbursement target for the first quarter to P47.3 billion. For the second quarter however, it still has to reach its original P669.4 billion in disbursements.,Second, the Bids and Awards Committees (BAC) staff of government agencies will be expanded for improved procurement procedures. The JCOCPE report said 90 new BAC positions have been created.,Third, AO 46 orders agencies to create full-time delivery units (FDUs) for the purpose of monitoring program or project implementation. These are to be headed by an officer with a rank no lower than Undersecretary.

He also questioned why these reforms are only being enacted now, when the administration only has months to go before its term ends, rather than when Aquino began his term. ,\u201cIt's too late the hero,\u201d Diokno says. ,These supposed reforms on budget execution, according to Diokno, are nothing more than \u201ca lot of song and dance.\u201d,The new guidelines allow for realignment or changing details about the project before obligations are incurred.,\u201cThe budget should already be composed of ready-to-implement projects,\u201d  he added. Instead, he said, the projects in the budget are neither identified nor ready.  ,Economic effects,Despite the slowed spending, the Philippines had its ,credit rating upgraded to BBB+ by the Japan Credit Rating Ltd., (READ: ,INFOGRAPHIC: What a credit rating upgrade means for Filipinos,) The upgrade may be a result of the Philippines having ,less debt, at the end of the first quarter. ,The president ,invited Japanese businessmen to invest in the Philippines, earlier in June., ,According to ,data from the World Bank, shown below, the Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) has been increasing which can be interpreted as a sign of economic growth. ,However, Diokno criticized the focus of this economic growth saying agricultural growth has been neglected in favor of urban-focused projects. Citing the ,Global Competitiveness Report for 2014-2015 ,by the World Economic Forum, Diokno said the underspending has costed the country so much in lost opportunities. The professor estimated the government has underspent by at least P529 billion from 2011 to 2014.,As a result, he said the Philippines ranks the worst in overall public infrastructure amongst the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 5.

{"content": "\nWhat's next after relief operations? Rebuilding what was lost.    ,WHAT'S NEXT? After relief comes another important task for the government: rebuilding communities. Photo by Noel Celis/AFP,MANILA, Philippines - ,The damage left by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) is often compared to that of the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004,. ,Though a bit different in scale (the Indian Ocean Tsunami affected several countries), both disasters claimed thousands of lives, left debris that caused delays in getting aid to affected residents, and cost billions in relief efforts and goods. ,Indonesia was one of the hardest hit countries by the Indian Ocean Tsunami. It left roughly 220,000 Indonesians either dead or missing. It destroyed 800 kilometers of coastline in the province of Aceh. Just months after, the island of Nias (also in Indonesia) was struck by an earthquake. It took more lives, destroyed infrastructure, and left people with no livelihood. ,International aid also poured in Indonesia the way it has been in the past few days for the Philippine provinces that were affected by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan).,To make the rehabilitation process of Aceh and Nias efficient, the Indonesian government set up an agency that headed one of the largest humanitarian programs in history \u2013 Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR) or the Agency for the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Aceh and Nias. The rehabilitation program cost about ,US$ 6.7 billion which was ,received from significant contributions from donor agencies and ,private citizens worldwide. It also involved the efforts of some 900 ,organizations.,From 2005 to 2009, the BRR worked with international agencies to reconstruct both Aceh and Nias. By now, the Indian Ocean Tsunami seems like a closed chapter in Indonesia's history but at one point, the world also came together to help people whose lives were devastated by nature's wrath. ,Lessons,After the rehabilitation process, the BRR came out with an academic observation they called \"10 Management Lessons for Host Governments Coordinating Post-disaster Reconstruction.\",Reading through the report, one cannot help but see similarities between Indonesia in 2004 and Eastern Visayas today.,\"When BRR was first established to coordinate the reconstruction effort, it was far from clear how we would accomplish our task. No one had ever dealt with a natural disaster of this magnitude. It was like starting with a clean slate,\" the paper's preface said. However, it was clear to the members of the BRR what the endgame should be: they have to rebuild the lives of the Indonesians that were affected by the tsunami and the earthquake.,The 10 lessons were organized into three phases: organize, execute, and fund. These lessons sought to help governments that are facing or preparing for the event of a large-scale disaster \u2013 and even those that have been affected by a calamity and need to rebuild communities virtually from scratch.,Here are excerpts from the BRR report, useful in rebuilding liveable communities:,ORGANIZE, ,EXECUTE, ,FUND ,One of the program's aspects that proved to be a success in the reconstruction efforts is the improvement of Aceh's infrastructure. Instead of just rebuilding what was destroyed, the BRR and the donors used to opportunity to make the lives of the tsunami and earthquake survivors better by building more infrastucture and generating more livelihood. ,In rebuilding the communities in Aceh and Nias, 155,182 laborers were given training. Major improvements in these affected areas were also made possible after the tragedy. ,The Philippines is getting billions of pesos in relief assistance,. The ,United Nations has also flashed an appeal worth $301 million, that will help not just in relief efforts, but in reconstruction as well.,After relief efforts, the government would soon have to move in to making the areas affected by Yolanda (Haiyan) liveable again. The effects of the typhoon and the storm surge are indeed tragic, but like Indonesia, we can also use the reconstruction efforts  to help the survivors live a better life.,All it takes is a proper system, cooperation, and a lot of faith. ,- Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/43882-lessons-indonesia-tsunami-haiyan-yolanda", "title": "Lessons: How Indonesians dealt with their own tsunami tragedy", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/150044-star-magic-ball-2016-kim-chiu-xian-lim-kimxi,http://www.rappler.com/nation/43352-aid-official-destruction-like-the-aftermath-of-a-tsunami,http://www.rappler.com/nation/43310-yolanda-international-community"},

They w,ere asked from March 20-23 who they believe would be the \"best leaders to succeed\" Aquino. ,Respondents were allowed to name up to 3 names top of mind. ,Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte showed a ,10-point surge from his 5% in December. Data made available did not show, ,however, how many of the respondents picked him as their first choice. But an earlier March, Pulse Asia survey also captured Duterte's rise. (READ: ,Duterte is No. 3 in presidential preference poll,) ,Business World, does not have a breakdown of the number of respondents who named both Binay and Poe. A look at disaggregated numbers should also show whose name is first mentioned in those cases.,Using a different methodology, the Pulse Asia survey conducted a few weeks earlier showed a wide lead for Binay (29%) over Poe (14%). Respondents were only allowed to pick one name from a long list of potential candidates. These numbers are expected to move drastically when the list is shortened to show only those who are actually running for the post.,In allowing respondents to give 3 names, the SWS survey can show which candidate can steal from the support base of another. A closer look at the data should show Poe's potential of eroding Binay's support base \u2013 should she decide to run for president.,Duterte's rise ,The SWS survey shows that given the error margin, the numbers of Binay and Poe overlap. Binay's numbers range from a low of 33% to a high of 39%, while Poe's numbers range from a low of 28% to a high of 34%. ,Binay could be ahead of Poe by 11 points. Or Poe could be ahead by one point. (READ: ,Nate Silver: Avoid errors by paying close attention to poll's 'margin of error',),1% is equivalent to an estimated 500,000 voters, considering the total registered voters of 50 million in the 2013 polls.,It's also a 10-point surge for Poe since her 21% ratings in the last SWS presidential survey on December 14. Binay's numbers were statistically unchanged from 37% in December.,The rest of the potential 2016 candidates are tailing far behind. Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II, also the Liberal Party's presumptive presidential candidate, and Duterte are tied with their 15%.,For Roxas, it's a 4-point drop from his 19% in December 2014. This is in sharp contrast to Duterte's 10-point increase from his previous 5%.,The respondents also named Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago (11%), former president Joseph Estrada (11%), Senator Francis Escudero (8%), Senator Ferdinand Marcos (7%), and Senator Alan Peter Cayetano (4%). The movement of their numbers from December are all within the error margin.,Binay's resilience, Poe's rise,Poe saw a ,surge, in her numbers last year when Binay was reeling from the blow of back-to-back corruption allegations. ,Her name has been floated as a possible alternative to Roxas, whose numbers are dismal, to become the administration candidate. (READ: ,No praise of Mar from Aquino at mayors' event,) ,Poe has expressed ,some openness, to the possibility in spite of her qualms. ,Binay's numbers, on the other hand, continued to show resilience in the face of the controversies. (READ: ,A year of tracking poll: Binay bounces back,),Reacting to the survey results, ,Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Herminio \"Sonny\" Coloma said, ,\"Surveys provide periodic and timely feedback on the public pulse at any given time.

Photo by Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 The opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), political party of Vice President Jejomar Binay, released a document on Tuesday, June 2, allegedly showing that Senator Grace Poe is not qualified to run for president or vice president in the 2016 elections. ,In a press conference at the House of Representatives, Navotas Representative Tobias Tiangco presented a copy of ,Poe's certificate of candidacy, for the previous mid-term elections. It showed that as of May 13, 2013, ,she had resided in the country for 6 years and 6 months.,This would mean that Poe would have lived in the Philippines for 9 years and 6 months by the May 2016 elections. Tiangco said this falls short of the required minimum of 10 years under the Constitution. ,Article VII, Section 2 of the Constitution states that an individual may run for president or vice president if he or she is: ,\"If honesty is so important to her, why is she not honest enough to tell us that she is not qualified to run for president or even vice president for 2016?\" Tiangco said. ,Tiangco, secretary general of UNA, was referring to Poe's tirades against the Vice President Jejomar Binay. ,Poe signed the Senate report, recommending plunder charges against Binay. ,The neophyte senator earlier took a swipe against the Vice President, saying that ,honesty should be the standard for higher posts, rather than length of service. ,Asked why Binay even considered Poe to be his, running mate, if UNA knew that she was not qualified, Tiangco said Binay was just being \"polite.\",\"She was never offered. VP Binay was asked if she was being considered so he answered,\" Tiangco said.

Because being buried at the Heroes' Cemetery is something that's deserved. Just going by the name, it's the cemetery for Filipinos we look up to, those who contributed a lot for our country, and who should be models of every Filipino.),Robredo added that a hero's burial is not about special treatment, but about whether or not a person has earned the right to lie alongside other Filipino heroes.,\",Ang tanong ngayon, deserving ba iyong dating pangulong Marcos para ilibing doon?

{"content": " STRATEGIC INVESTMENT. Referred to as the missing middle the KALSADA program will have a large impact on making provinces cities and municipalities more business friendly and competitive. Photo by Karlos Manlupig Rappler MANILA Philippines The government will spend P6.5 billion 138.71 million for the rehabilitation and upgrading of provincial roads in 73 provinces in 2016 the Department of Budget and Management DBM said.The DBM said that the amount has been appropriated in the 2016 General Appropriations Act with the allocation of funds based on performance. xa0Budget Secretary Florencio Abad said that the qualified provinces have not only met good governance standards and social development benchmarks but have also established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.Dubbed KALSADA or Konkreto at Ayos na Lansangan at Daan Tungo sa Pangkalahatang Kaunlaran Abad said the program is an innovative devolution program that aims to institutionalize good governance by enabling and shepherding local government units on Local Road Management. The program is seen to rehabilitate and upgrade provincial roads and transfer these road assets permanently to the provincial government for maintenance.Abad said the program will also develop the Provincial Road Network Development Plan PRNDP for each province and promote the use of an online open data portal as a mechanism for monitoring and evaluation of provincial roads.In partnership with the World Bank and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the government has created a system that uses geo tagging for reporting on the status of the projects. xa0Through the Open Roads Portal the public can check online which roads have been selected for rehabilitation or upgrading and track the progress of the road project from start to completion.The Open Roads Portal will contain the uploaded provincial road network maps as well as videos of the conditions of priority roads before during and after the implementation of KALSADA. xa0 The KALSADA program gives weight to the words meaningful devolution. The national government will provide capital funding to offset road asset depreciation even as local government units LGUs rehabilitate long neglected provincial roads the budget chief said. With LGUs delivering basic services more effectively by planning and managing their resources more efficiently we re able to fully utilize the budget to attain inclusive growth Abad added.For Public Works and Highways Secretary Rogelio Singson the KALSADA program is an exemplar considering that capital funding required to offset road asset depreciation has never been given to provinces. Provincial roads are the largest and most important asset being managed by provincial local governments. These road networks link national roads to areas of economic development allow access to basic services and serve as important conduits during conflict crises and calamities Singson said. Every time a province undertakes capital works to rehabilitate one kilometer km of road it uses funds that should have funded 4 km of road maintenance. This continuous drain from maintenance funding has effectively cut maintenance funding and asset life spans in half he added.Singson said that the cumulative cost of lost asset life is P11.1 billion 236.87 million per year when computed across all 81 provinces.Singson also said provincial arterial roads and farm to market roads will get the bulk of infrastructure investment in 2017 after completion of all construction and upgrading of national roads and bridges in 2016.Likewise local bridges and roads will be upgraded to ensure the safe use of local infrastructure. With the rehabilitation and construction of national roads and bridges throughout the country set to be completed by the end of 2016 arterial provincial roads and farm to market roads are next on our priority list Singson said. The government will need to invest in approximately 180 000 km of local roads 32 000 km of provincial roads 15 000 km in cities 4 000 km in 1 400 municipalities and about 129 000 km in the 42 000 barangays across the country he added.Singson said that KALSADA is a strategic investment in local roads and bridges infrastructure.Referred to as the missing middle Singson said the program will have a large impact on making provinces cities and municipalities more business friendly and competitive.

File photo from Poe's Facebook page ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 \u201c,Hindi sa haba ng serbisyo ang kailangang batayan kundi ang kalidad ng serbisyo at katapatan.,\u201d (It's not the length of service that is the standard but the quality of service and honesty.),Neophyte senator Grace Poe challenged Vice President Jejomar Binay's statement that \u201c,experience and competence,\u201d should be the basis for electing leaders in the 2016 presidential polls. ,Poe candidly responded to the veiled criticism from the opposition's standard bearer by admitting her inexperience, but also playing up her strengths as an honest lawmaker. ,\u201c,Kung ikumpara sa kanya, maikli lang ang oras ng aking paninilbihan, pero hindi naman sa pagbubuhat ng bangko\u2026ay sinikap ko namang gumawa ng marami para makatulong lalo na sa mga pinakamahirap nating mga kababayan na naapi at hindi nadidinig,,\u201d Poe said on Monday, May 18. ,(Compared to him, my time in government is much shorter, but not to boast, I tried to do a lot to help the poorest of our countrymen who are abused and voiceless.) ,She said honesty was the same consideration in electing the late President Corazon Aquino, whom Binay supported as a human rights lawyer during the martial law days. ,Poe responded to the ,statement ,Binay made in Cagayan de Oro City on Sunday that \u201cit would be risky to entrust the next government to those without experience and competence since it would perpetuate the problems besetting the country today.\u201d,The senator is only nearing her second year as a legislator, after her stint as chief of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board.,Poe said instead of talking about leadership and 2016, Binay should just show honesty by responding to the various corruption allegations against him. ,\u201cIt should not just be his spokesperson who will explain. Even I, I cannot deny that we have common experiences, but we cannot ask him about these issues. I also want to know. That's why it is so hard to attend hearings when the accused himself does not show up because it's like you are talking behind that person's back,\u201d Poe said in Filipino.,The senator said that evidence and the public will ultimately judge Binay following a series of corruption scandals during his leadership of the country's financial district, Makati, in over two decades. ,Last week, the Court of Appeals (CA) issued a ,freeze order, on the bank accounts of Binay, his wife Elenita, son Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin \u201cJunjun\u201d Binay Jr, and alleged dummies over \u201clarge and frequent\u201d transactions done during the construction of the allegedly overpriced Makati parking building, and the Makati Science High School. ,Poe laughed when asked whether the AMLC also looked into her bank accounts. ,\u201c,Hindi pag-aaksayahan ng [AMLC] 'yung aking account dahil, unang-una, baka maawa pa sila sa akin,,\u201d she said in jest. ,\u201c,Mga P500,000 per transaction ay bihira tayong umabot doon.

She is believed to be a viable candidate to beat Binay. In the, March 2015 Pulse Asia survey,, Poe ranked second with 14%, next to Binay who got 29%. ,President Benigno Aquino III ,met with Poe, in early May to discuss possibly drafting her for higher office under his ruling Liberal Party (LP) in 2016.,'Comfortable with Chiz but no party' ,Poe addressed reports that LP members are lobbying for a tandem between her and her close friend, Senator Francis Escudero, or one with her and Interior Secretary Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas II, LP president-on-leave. ,The front runner in the 2013 senatorial race said she was more \u201ccomfortable\u201d with Escudero than with Roxas. ,Escudero was the campaign spokesperson of her father, the late action star Fernando Poe Jr, when he ran for president in 2004. Senator Grace Poe and Escudero were also partners in their 2013 campaign, and now in the Senate. ,\u201cHindi naman maipagkakaila na mahaba na ang pinagsamahan namin. 2004 pa lang magkasama na kami sa tatay ko. Marami na siyang napatunayan sa paninilbihan sa gobyerno \u2026 Pero hindi naman lamang iyon ang magiging basehan. Unang-una, pareho kaming walang partido,,\u201d Poe said. ,(We cannot deny that we went through a lot. Back in 2004, we were already together for my father. He has proven a lot in government service. But that is not the only basis. First, both of us have no party.),Poe said she and Escudero only joke about 2016 in private discussions.,Escudero said in a separate interview that whether or not he runs for higher office, he will remain independent. He has no plans of joining any political party, effectively ruling out the LP. ,The senator reiterated that for independent politicians like him and Poe, money and machinery are key considerations. ,\u201c'Yung mga pinanganak na hindi mayaman, 'yon naman talaga palagi ang konsiderasyon: kung saan kukuha ng resources, kung 'yan yung mga taong tutulong sa kanila sa anumang kandidatura.\u201d ,(Those who are not born rich will always consider how to get resources, and the people who will help them in their candidacy.), ,\u2013, Rappler.com , , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/93593-poe-binay-honesty-over-experience", "title": "Poe to Binay: Honesty over experience", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156674-duterte-christmas-eve-photos,http://www.rappler.com/nation/93515-binay-experience-competence-presidential-bid,http://www.rappler.com/nation/93515-binay-experience-competence-presidential-bid"},

{"content": "\n(UPDATED) From 4th place in September, Poe jumps to 2nd place in Pulse Asia's November presidential preference survey    ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 Has Vice President Jejomar Binay weathered the worst political storm yet that could affect his chances in the 2016 presidential elections? Or is his political base slowly getting eroded?,The latest Pulse Asia nationwide survey obtained by Rappler shows Binay shedding off an additional 5 percentage points in the presidential race \u2013 from ,31% in September, to 26% in November 2014.,Office of the Vice President's (OVP) Media Affairs head Joey Salgado downplayed the survey results, saying the 5% decline \"is marginal, according to Pulse Asia.\",The survey had 1,200 respondents with a ,\u00b1,3 margin of error. It was conducted from November 14-20 and listed 14 names for respondents to choose from. On the other hand, the September survey had 15 potential presidential candidates.,At the time of the survey, Binay had just ,backed out from a scheduled debate, with Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, preferring instead to barnstorm around the country.,The Vice President has been battered with allegations of corruption during his term as Makati mayor. His former ally, former ,Makati vice mayor Ernesto Mercado,, has been unleashing one expos\u00e9 after another \u2013 from ,hidden bank accounts, to alleged ,kickbacks from overpriced construction projects, and ,alleged ill-gotten wealth,. He has alleged that ,these anomalies are perpetuated by the Binay dynasty in Makati.,Salgado brushed these aside, saying the results are \"welcome news because the survey was taken at a time when the VP's detractors were aggressively throwing mud against him in the Senate and in media.\" He added that Trillanes' boast that in this survey Binay's numbers would drop by 10 points or more did not happen.,\"For us, it means that the people have seen through the motives of the senators who style themselves as presidentiables. The people have seen the absence of substance behind the posturing and drama. The people are also telling the senators to stop the mudslinging and attend to the more pressing needs of the country,\" Salgado said in a text message.,Drops among social classes,The survey results showed that Binay suffered his biggest setback in Luzon, dropping 10 percentage points, from 32 in September, to 22 in November.,He dropped 4 points in Metro Manila, and 3 points in Mindanao. He gained 1 point in the Visayas region. Binay has been going around the provinces there.,Among social classes, Binay sustained drops across the board. He shed off 5 points among ABC; 6 points among D and 3 points among E. The D and E, comprising the majority of voters, are considered the bailiwick of Binay\u2019s votes. ,Still, if the elections were to be held today, Binay would win by a plurality. ,But the gap has narrowed.,Grace Poe's gain,Surging from the Pulse Asia November survey is neophyte Senator Grace Poe-Llamanzares, who jumped from ,10% ,to 18%.,Poe, daughter of the late action star Fernando Poe Jr, posted substantial increases across the board. From 10 points and 9 points in NCR and Luzon, she leap-frogged to 19 points and 20 points, respectively. In Mindanao, she advanced from 8 to 19 points. In the Visayas however, she lost 1 point, from 14% to 13%.,Among social classes, Poe posted double digits across the board: 17 points among the ABC, 20 points among the D, and 15 points among the E. In the September survey, she managed 9 points among the ABC, 12 points among the D, and 6 points among the E.,Significantly, Poe is in a tie with Binay among the ABC, and is within striking distance in Luzon.,By deduction, and based on the numbers of the other potential presidential candidates, it appears Poe is the biggest beneficiary of Binay\u2019s decline in numbers.,Poe has ,balked at seeking the presidency,, but certain quarters are ,pushing for a Poe-Leni Robredo tandem in 2016,.,Other highlights,Other highpoints of the survey:,Others in the list were:,VP race,In the vice-presidential race, Poe retained the top spot as the preferred choice, followed by Escudero and Cayetano. The 3 posted double-digit numbers.,Poe tightened her grip with 33%; Escudero, 20% and Cayetano, 13%. From the September survey, Poe advanced by 2 percentage points, Escudero, 1 percentage point, and Cayetano, 4 percentage points.,Senator Antonio Trillanes IV lagged behind with 8%, in a tie with Marcos.,Cayetano and Trillanes are leading the charge against Binay in the Senate sub-committee Blue Ribbon hearing. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/77528-poe-november-pulse-survey-binay", "title": "Poe surges in Nov Pulse survey, Binay drops by 5%", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/68370-star-magic-ball-2014-best-dressed-gowns-red-carpet,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario"},
{"content": "\nCommunity-Managed Savings and Credit Association or COMSCA is a community-managed initiative where groups in the community mobilize and manage their own savings and provide loans to members    ,NORMALCY. Typhoon Yolanda survivors in Estancia, Iloilo attend a program on financial management. Photo by Ted Aldwin Ong/ Rappler ,ILOILO, Philippines \u2013 The recovery work continues two years after Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit the coastal towns and small islands in Iloilo province.,Apart from building shelters and marine resource management for fisherfolks in reconstruction work, many of the survivors need livelihood because of the limited resources to support income-generating activities., ,Given this need, 4 non-governmental organizations that were at the frontline of delivering relief goods post-Yolanda to the coastal towns of Batad, Carles, Concepcion, and Estancia, have integrated a livelihood component in its reconstruction work.,International humanitarian organization Christian Aid and the Iloilo Caucus of Development NGOs (Iloilo CODE-NGO), together with Panay Rural Development Center, Incorporated (PRDCI) and University of the Philippines Visayas Foundation, Incorporated (UPVFI), gathered around 800 beneficiaries for a general assembly under its livelihood program, which adopted the concept called Community-Managed Savings and Credit Association (CoMSCA)., ,Held in Estancia National High School with the theme \u201cSave and Share Because We Care,\" the event was an avenue for sharing of stories, experiences and practices on how Typhoon Yolanda survivors coped and recovered from the calamity and gradually went back to normalcy two years after., ,Background on CoMSCA, ,The idea of CoMSCA evolved from numerous interventions that sought to offer financial assistance for livelihood. It is a community-managed initiative wherein groups in the community mobilize and manage their own savings and provide loans to members. It also offers a limited form of financial insurance.,CoMSCA is different from micro-finance institutions. It is self-managed and independent, which means the members of the group in the community are the ones who manage the money they put in. It is considered time-bound or it follows its own financial cycle and group members share equity at least once a year in proportion to savings.,The concept works best in the Philippine context for it creates local pools of capital and it provides access to useful lump sums which can be used for predictable expenses, to reduce shocks to vulnerable livelihood, to facilitate household cash-flow management, and to allow short-term investment in income-generating activities.,The adoption and implementation of the CoMSCA concept in 3 municipalities has been proven to work because of the socio-economic characteristic of the communities involved which are mostly very poor.,The face behind CoMSCA,Engineer Ernesto Macabenta, a micro-finance specialist that offers support to livelihood activities for people\u2019s organizations, developed the ,idea of COMSCA.,Having observed and studied the advantages and disadvantages of offering different forms of finance support for livelihood, Macabenta envisioned  a type of savings system suited for the Philippines, which is practical, and not too complicated to implement. , ,In 2009, Macabenta formalized CoMSCA in Cotabato and eventually, the concept was adopted in many parts of the country and implemented by World Vision Development Foundation, Incorporated as its economic program.          ,    ,Macabenta is an associate director of World Vision., ,It was eventually adopted by Christian Aid and its project partners and implemented in post-Yolanda reconstruction work in the 4 municipalities in Iloilo which are project sites of Iloilo CODE-NGOs, PRDCI and UPVFI., ,According to Faye Joy Pabiona, project manager of \u201cRebuilding for the Better\u201d project, CoMSCA is well suited for Yolanda-hit areas because the communities are mostly in isolated locations which hinder people's access to financial aid from established financed institutions., ,\u201cMajority of the people in distant communities and small islands lack the necessary legal document that are required to access financial support for livelihood activities making recovery slow to achieve,\u201d explained Pabiona.     ,Pabiona added that CoMSCA is flexible and simple to adopt and implement because transparency is embedded in its system. It provides a frequent opportunity to save and regular opportunity to borrow. The system itself is savings-based and not credit-based.,How it works in Iloilo, ,Iloilo CODE-NGO organized Yolanda survivors into clusters for CoMSCA in the 3 municipalities. Vilma Perote, CoMSCA officer of Iloilo CODE-NGOs, explained how the system works:,Social change and learnings, ,CoMSCA has many observable social impacts on members of the community. Emmanuel Are\u00f1o, executive director of Iloilo CODE-NGO, underscored the changes in attitude they observed among community members.,\u201cWe have observed emerging leaders by implementing CoMSCA. It developed leadership skills, not only among chairpersons, but also among cluster members. It also promoted among themselves the value of discipline and time management as they handled meetings with regularity,\" said Are\u00f1o.  ,\u201cManaging their own resources made them more responsible in using money and improved their sense of accountability,\u201d added Are\u00f1o.  , ,For his part, Jorge Ebay, executive director of the UPVFI, shared that \u201cit also improved people\u2019s financial literacy and made them better understand that financial systems need not be complicated for them to adopt and implement.\u201d, ,\u201cIt likewise changed their attitude towards contracting debt from informal providers which are rampant in locations with high poverty incidence,\u201d Ebay emphasized.  ,Andres Tionko, ,PRDCI, executive director, also stressed that CoMSCA is \u201cpeople\u2019s empowerment at work. It re-inculcated the value of unity through community work by pulling resources into a collective rather than individual effort.\u201d,The experience that Yolanda survivors underwent reoriented people in Iloilo\u2019s coastal towns on the value of household and community-based practices on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The implementation of COMSCA reinforced this concept \u2013 this time on livelihood \u2013 and had made them realize that the power to recover from disasters rest in collective action.,The project \u201cRebuilding for the Better\u201d will be completed in September 2016. The livelihood component through CoMSCA now has a total of 64 cluster beneficiaries. Five clusters are being supervised by UPVFI in Isla Higantes, Carles, 5 by PDRCI in the Municipality of Batad, and 54 by Iloilo CODE-NGO in the municipalities of Concepcion, Carles, and Estancia., \u2013 Rappler.com,Ted Aldwin E.

Besides Binay, among those reportedly eyeing the presidency in 2016 is Senator Grace Poe, a neophyte politician who said that her inexperience makes her reluctant to run for higher office. ,Amid multiple allegations of corruption, Binay remains the top contender for the 2016 presidential race based on recent political surveys.,The vice president is accused of approving questionable government deals under his watch as Makati's chief executive. He faces plunder and graft complaints for an allegedly overpriced construction of a Makati car park building and a public high school building.,There is likewise an ongoing ,probe into bank accounts, under his name over suspicions of money laundering in relation to corruption complaints. The Court of Appeals issued on May 11 ,a freeze order ,on the bank accounts of Binay, his relatives, and his alleged dummies. ,Target: Lower poverty incidence,Binay's statement comes two days after a speech he delivered before Philippine business owners stressing the need for leaders with the political will to implement growth-driving economic policies.,As an example, Binay said the relatively comprehensive provision of basic social services to Makati residents during his time as mayor served as \"instruments of growth.\",\"The not-so-good news is that our poverty incidence in the first half of 2014 was still a dismal 25.8 %, even worse than the 24.6% rate we registered in the first half of the previous year, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). One out of 4 Filipinos is living below the poverty line. What went wrong?\" Binay questioned then.,\"Why weren\u2019t we able to reduce our poverty rate despite our growth?\" he questioned further. \"We can\u2019t blame Typhoon Yolanda for the increase, because PSA deliberately excluded Leyte from its survey sampling last year.\",\"If we don\u2019t arrest this downward drift, we may become a nation of mendicants before we know it,\" Binay said.,The administration of President Benigno Aquino III has pledged to lower the country's poverty incidence to at least 18% by 2016, still above the 16.6% target under the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/93515-binay-experience-competence-presidential-bid", "title": "Binay: I'll bring 'competence' to Malaca\u00f1ang", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/133877-two-pronged-ofw-husband-wife"},
{"content": "\n'The Philippines should repeal its laws that punish women and girls who have undergone abortions as a matter of public policy to save women\u2019s lives'    ,Many Filipinos condemn women and girls who induce abortion not knowing that some of these women and girls are actually rape or incest victims., ,A Filipino woman or girl is raped every 72 minutes.,In 2014, the Philippine National Police (PNP) recorded 7,409 women who reported they were raped.  The PNP reported that rape accounted for almost 9% of all reported ,Violence Against Women, (VAW) cases from 2004 to 2013. ,Meanwhile, the 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey estimated 6% of women ages 15 to 49 reported having ever experienced sexual violence. (READ: ,Kids aren't supposed to be for sex,),This is alarming, yet this may just be the tip of the iceberg as these numbers only refer to the rape victims who reported to the police. ,One of the glaring consequences of rape is unwanted pregnancy. Having been sexually abused, Filipino women and girls have resorted to unsafe and clandestine abortions to end their unwanted pregnancies while others have tried to commit suicide. ,A Women\u2019s Crisis Center research showed that 83% of their women rape survivors have induced unsafe abortion.,For many people, ,rape, seems very remote, something they only hear about in the news.  But for us who assist rape victims on a daily basis, it is very much a reality. ,Lawyers, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and police officers who assist rape victims witness the pain that these women suffer.  ,Our country cannot deny rape survivors their right to terminate unwanted pregnancies resulting from rape. Our laws must provide rape survivors the right to decide what is good for their health and lives. These women and girls already suffered an extremely traumatic human rights violation. ,It is our duty as a state, regardless of one\u2019s religious beliefs, to provide access to safe and legal abortion to rape survivors. If we don\u2019t, these women and girls may die or be hospitalized due to complications from induced unsafe and clandestine abortion.,It is high time that we face the issue of access to safe and legal abortion as public health and human rights issues where women who are rape victims would have the freedom to access safe and legal abortion and not be denied by the state their right to decide for their health and lives.,Punishing women, ,Our restrictive criminal law on abortion having been based on the old Spanish Penal Code of 1870, not even religion, has prevented women from inducing unsafe and clandestine abortion.  ,The illegality of abortion has not deterred women from terminating their unwanted pregnancies. It has only made it risky for Filipino women and girls. (READ: ,Isn't time to legalize abortion in the PH?,),Based on the estimates of the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), more than half of all pregnancies in the Philippines were unintended and about 20% of these unintended pregnancies end up in abortion. ,The reality is that women and girls including married women, many of them Catholics, resort to unsafe and clandestine abortion to terminate their unwanted pregnancies. ,Based on the latest AGI report, there were 610,000 Filipino women who induced abortion in 2012, with 1,000 women dying from complications from unsafe abortion \u2014 that\u2019s about 3 women dying each day.,Meanwhile, over 100,000 women were hospitalized due to complications from unsafe and clandestine abortions.,It has been reported in 2012 and 2013 that unsafe abortion was one of the top 3 obstetrics-gynecological cases in 8 out of 9 hospitals managed by the Department of Health (DOH).,The current Philippine law punishing women who induce abortion \u2014without any clear exceptions and religious imposition of one\u2019s beliefs \u2014has been used by doctors to unlawfully deny post-abortion care to women and to threaten women with prosecution. ,Women suffering complications due to ,spontaneous abortion, abortion due to trauma from intimate partner violence, and even fetal death have also been denied access to post-abortion care and were threatened with criminal prosecution.,Contrary to the Hippocratic oath of doctors, some doctors violate and continue to violate their oath and the doctor-patient confidentiality by denying access to post-abortion care, threatening to report the women to the police \u2014 violating the clear provisions of the Reproductive Health (RH) Law to provide access to humane and non-judgmental post-abortion care.  ,To save women\u2019s lives and to comply with existing Philippine laws, doctors should provide humane and non-judgmental ,post-abortion care, required under the RH Law. ,They must also stabilize women suffering from serious and emergency cases resulting from complications from unsafe and clandestine abortion required under ,Republic Act 8344,, and to provide appropriate health services for pregnancy-related complications such as abortion required under the ,Magna Carta of Women,.  ,As a matter of public health, doctors should act as medical providers not police officers, otherwise, women will simply not seek medical attention and end up dying for fear of being prosecuted.,Health providers must keep abreast with our laws requiring appropriate post-abortion care and the DOH on the Policy on Prevention and Management of Abortion and its Complications (PMAC), which has been implemented since 2000 and trained public doctors from pilot hospitals to provide post-abortion care. ,DOH also has a program where national government\u2013run hospitals such as Fabella and Bulacan Provincial Hospital manage special units treating abortion complications.,Saving women's lives ,All of these laws and programs providing post-abortion care save women\u2019s lives.,Contrary to the misconception of doctors, there is no law requiring doctors to report women who induce abortion. Presidential Decree 169 requires medical practitioners who treated serious or less serious physical injuries covered under articles 262 to 265 of the Revised Penal Code to report injury, diagnosis, and treatment.  ,But such articles do not refer to abortion.,Other predominantly Catholic countries and former Spanish colonies have liberalized their laws on abortion, with Spain legalizing abortion on request during the first 14 weeks of the pregnancy in 2010.,Other predominantly Catholic countries like Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Costa Rica, and Ireland and former Spanish colonies such as Uruguay and Colombia also allow abortion on certain grounds \u2014 leaving the Philippines to contend with its antiquated colonial Spanish law.,Asian countries like China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam all have liberal abortion laws. Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand have also recently liberalized their laws to allow abortion on certain grounds., ,Some people mistakenly believe that the Philippine Constitution prohibits abortion because of the provision on equal protection of the life of the woman and the unborn from conception. On the contrary, other countries with constitutions and laws explicitly protecting the life of the unborn or life from conception allow abortion under certain exceptions such as Ireland, Slovak Republic, Poland, Kenya, Hungary, and Costa Rica.,Take this case in Peru as an example. ,In the complaint of LC vs Peru filed with the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee), LC was 13 when a 34-year-old man started sexually abusing her.  ,She became pregnant as a result of the rape and \u2014 in a state of depression \u2014 attempted suicide by jumping from a building, suffering spinal injuries with \u201ca risk of permanent disability.\u201d Despite her serious and deteriorating condition, her doctors refused to perform an operation because she was pregnant and denied her request for therapeutic abortion. LC then miscarried spontaneously.  ,In 2009, CEDAW recommended Peru to provide reparation to LC, and to review its laws to establish effective access to therapeutic abortion, to include protocols to ensure health services are available and accessible in public facilities, and to decriminalize abortion when the pregnancy results from rape.,In 2006, CEDAW also recommended for the Philippines to remove its punitive provisions imposed on women who induce abortion and to provide access to quality services for the management of complications arising from unsafe abortions in order to reduce maternal mortality rates.,And in the 2014 CEDAW report on the inquiry on reproductive rights violations in the Philippines, it recommended for the Philippines to amend articles 256 to 259 of the Revised Penal Code to \u201clegalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, threats to the life and/or health of the mother, or serious malformation of the fetus and decriminalize all other cases where women undergo abortion.\u201d (READ: ,PH accountable for Manila's reproductive rights violations,),As a state party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Philippines should repeal its laws that punish women and girls who have undergone abortions as a matter of public policy to save women\u2019s lives. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Clara \"Claire\" Rita Padilla is the founder and executive director of EnGendeRights, a non-governmental organization championing women's rights.

Her internal organs were removed and her vagina was sawed off to cover signs of torture and sexual abuse. Liliosa Hilao is considered to be the first female casualty and martyr of Martial Law. ,Zero criticism, ,Martial Law engineer Juan Ponce Enrile defined subversion ,during a 1977 BBC interview,: \u201canybody who goes against the government or who tries to convince people to go against the government \u2013 that is subversion.\u201d Proclamation 1081 gave the military the authority to arrest, detain, and execute anyone who even dared to breathe sadly about the Marcos administration.,Archimedes Trajano was only 21 when he questioned Imee Marcos on why she was the National Chairman of the Kabataang Barangay during an open forum. He was forcibly taken from the venue by Imee's bodyguards, and was ,tortured and thrown out of a building window,, ,all because the presidential daughter was irked by his question.,Maria Elena Ang, was a 23-year-old UP Journalism student when she was arrested and detained. She was beaten, electrocuted, water cured, and sexually violated during her detention. , ,Dr Juan Escandor was a young doctor with UP-PGH who was tortured and killed by the Philippine Constabulary. When his body was recovered, ,a pathologist found, that his skull had been broken open, emptied and stuffed with trash, plastic bags, rags and underwear. His brain was stuffed inside his abdominal cavity. ,Boyet Mijares was only 16 years old in 1977 when he received a call that his disappeared father (whistleblower and writer ,Primitivo Mijares,) was still alive. The caller invited the younger Mijares to see him. A few days later, Boyet's body was ,found dumped, outside Manila, his eyeballs protruding, his chest perforated with multiple stab wounds, his head bashed in, and his hands, feet and genitals mangled.,Trinidad Herrera was a community leader in Tondo when she was arrested in 1977. In this ,video, she recounts being electrocuted on her fingers, breasts, and vagina until her interrogators were pleased with her answers to their questions. ,Neri Colmenares was an 18-year-old activist when he was arrested and tortured by members of the Philippine Constabulary.

Michael Chua wrote a ,paper, detailing the torture methods used during the Marcos regime.,Aside from electrocution of body parts and genitals, it was routine to waterboard political prisoners, ,burn them using cigarettes, and flat irons, strangle them using wires and steel bars, and rub pepper on their genitals. Women were stripped naked, made to sit on ice blocks or stand in cold rooms, and were ,sexually assaulted, using objects such as eggplants smeared with chili peppers.,Forty-three years have passed. Time, as well as the circus that is Philippine governance make it easy to forget Martial Law as the darkest and most terrible moments in Philippine history. Many of its victims have died or have chosen to remain silent \u2013 silence being most understandable because these stories are truly difficult to remember, and much harder to tell. ,Stories need to be told,Yet these horrific stories need to be told over and over until we realize that the pretty cover of the book of the Marcos years is actually full of monster stories. We need to bring the graphic accounts of torture and murder to light so that those who rest comfortably in their illusions that the Marcos years were pleasant will at least be stirred., ,Instead we often hear from those who want to erase the evils of the past, those who tell us that these young people, many of them barely past their childhoods when they were tortured and killed, were violent rebels who sought to overthrow the government. Never mind that it was one of the most corrupt and cruel dictatorships the world has ever known, and that it was by the efforts of these young heroes that the reign of the Marcoses ended. ,Majority of Martial Law victims were in their 20s and 30s at that time \u2013 the same age our younger citizens are now \u2013 those who have the luxury of shrugging off the Marcos years as a wonderful time. Unscathed by a more cruel past, the younger generation is only too eager to criticize the current state of our government and our people as being undisciplined and requiring an iron fist such as the one Marcos used to supposedly create peace in the past.,They forget that if we were still under Martial Law (or should it return), such sentiments of \u201csubversion\u201d could cost them their lives, and that the same freedom and voice they use to reminisce about a time they know nothing about would have been muted and extinguished if we did not have the democracy we enjoy today.,Hindsight is always 20-20, as they say. It's convenient to look at the past with rose-colored glasses instead of memories of needles in your nail beds, electric wires attached to your genitals, and a barrel of a gun thrust inside your mouth, the way thousands of Martial Law victims suffered and still suffer to this day. ,Just because it didn't happen to you or your family doesn't mean it didn't happen to more than, ,70,000 victims, during that time. Just because you were spared then doesn't mean you will be spared the next time this iron fist you wish for comes around. \u2013 ,Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/106827-martial-law-stories-hear", "title": "#NeverAgain: Martial Law stories young people need to hear", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/about-rappler/about-us/164739-war-on-drugs-deaths-under-investigation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/170818-what-happens-local-government-units-martial-law,http://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/don-kevin-hapal/132879-martial-law-aquino-marcos,http://www.rappler.com/nation/170791-lawmakers-failure-intelligence-marawi-attack-martial-law,http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/105362-marcos-brand-amnesia,http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/103186-learned-helplessness-metro-manila"},
{"content": "\nThis could help contextualize the country\u2019s drug problem and put in perspective the government\u2019s response    ,WAR ON DRUGS. The Duterte administration has vowed long-term benefits from its war on drugs. Photos by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The aggressive war against illegal drugs is one issue where instinct and emotion \u2013 rather than facts and reason \u2013 have unfortunately taken hold on many fronts. ,Whether in the streets, the Senate halls, or our Facebook feeds, the discussions surrounding this drug war have resulted in an unprecedented level of discord and misunderstanding among Filipinos.,Before the drug war, the death toll, and the animosity in social networks escalate any further, perhaps now would be a good time to step back, breathe deeply, and look at the facts and figures surrounding the nature and extent of the country\u2019s drug problem.,For this purpose, we have compiled key drug-related statistics from relevant government agencies. These could help contextualize the country\u2019s drug problem and put into perspective the government\u2019s response. Everyone is invited to look at and verify these data. References and links are provided below.,1) The latest ,official, estimate of drug users in the country is 1.3 million as of 2012.,Perhaps the first relevant statistic in any drug war is an estimate of the extent of drug use. After all, drug-related crimes ultimately stem from drug use.,In his first ,State of the Nation Address,, President Rodrigo Duterte said that, based on data from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), there were about \u201c3 million drug addicts\u201d in the country \u201ctwo or 3 years ago,\u201d and possibly 3.7 million now.,However, a closer look shows that relevant drug law agencies came up with much lower official statistics in recent years (see Figure 1).,In 2008, a survey conducted by the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) estimated a much lower figure of ,1.7 million, drug users nationwide (1.9% of the 2008 population). In 2012, the DDB in cooperation with the Philippine Normal University came up with a separate study that put the figure to be even lower at ,1.3 million, (1.3% of the 2012 population).,Figure 1. In 1999, the DDB estimated 1.8 million regular users and 1.6 million occasional users of illegal drugs, totaling 3.4 million users. In 2001, the 5.8 million figure is the average of the 2.2-9.3 million users estimated by SWS. Subsequent figures were obtained by the DDB through surveys. Source: DDB Annual Report (various years).  ,Both figures actually represent a huge decline of drug users from the ,6.7 million, reported by the DDB way back in 2004. It appears, then, that the extent of drug use in the country seems to have actually gone down from 2004 to 2012 (6.7 million to 1.3 million) \u2013 or a total decline of 81% in 8 years.,The DDB ,attributed, this steep decline to supply and demand reduction efforts, like  \"intensified operations\" of drug law enforcement agencies and \"drug demand reduction programs.\",Of course, measuring drug use is complicated and estimates can be subject to wide margins. It has also been 4 years since the 1.3-million estimate of the DDB, and drug use may have increased or decreased since then.,Thankfully, the DDB is set to release soon its latest estimates of drug use for 2015. This could provide a valuable benchmark against which the Duterte administration can measure the progress of its drug war.,2) The number of drug-related raids and arrests in 2014 were the highest in a decade.,The data also show that gains in drug law enforcement were made in the past few years (see Figure 2).,First, note there was a significant drop in drug arrests and raids around 2004, and the trend started to increase around 2013. In fact, the number of drug raids and arrests conducted by PDEA in 2014 was the highest since 2004 and 2006, respectively. The number of admissions into drug rehabilitation centers also increased to more than 10,000 in 2014.,Figure 2. Sources: PDEA and DDB, as collected in the Philippine Statistical Yearbook 2015. ,What can explain these correlated trends? Could they be an indication of the changing aggressiveness of past administrations in going after drugs? Or could they be indirect measures of the rise and fall of the drug problem on the ground? Understanding the causality (rather than just the correlations) behind these trends highlights the need for further research.,Incidentally, the number of marijuana plantation sites eradicated by the PDEA in 2014 (506 sites) were also at an all-time high in 2014 (see Figure 3). This would suggest that at least some credit should go to the drug law enforcement agencies in helping reduce drug supply over the years and using data to monitor such progress.,Figure 3. Source: DDB Annual Report 2014. ,3) Rehab patients tend to be male, poor, and addicted to shabu.,Lastly, we can learn more about the nature of drug use in the country by looking at the profile of drug users in rehabilitation centers.,Of course, not all drug users have the opportunity to undergo rehab, and the following figures may not be representative of the average drug user in the country. But still, the administrative data collected by the DDB give a number of useful insights. We summarize some of these below.,Figure 4. Source: Simple averages using data on the DDB website for various years. Note: Income data refer to monthly family income for 2015 only. As of the first semester of 2015, the monthly poverty threshold for a family of five is P9,140 according to the PSA. ,First, rehab patients are overwhelmingly male (around 10 males for every female), and the mean age is around 30 years. Nearly a third have reached some level of college while over a quarter have reached some level of high school.,The unemployed are more likely to be in rehab than the employed, while more out-of-school youths are in rehab than students. Three out of 4 rehab patients have a monthly family income of less than P11,000 (just above the poverty threshold), while the average monthly income of rehab patients is around P16,000.,Finally, Figure 5 shows that, as of 2012, patients who entered rehab reported shabu and marijuana as the primary drugs that they abused.,Figure 5. Source: DDB website. ,By looking at the profile of rehab patients through the lens of statistics, the Duterte administration can better target its interventions and make better use of its resources for both prevention and rehabilitation. (READ: ,San Miguel Corporation\u2019s 1-billion donation for rehab centers,),Conclusion,As the momentum of the current drug war increases, let's all keep in mind why we are doing it in the first place: to reduce the prevalence of drug use.,There are two primary ways of doing it: by reducing drug supply or reducing drug demand. But at a more fundamental level, even before we decide which strategy is better, it will do well for everyone to step back and contemplate first the current nature and extent of drug use using all available information.,Policymaking around the world is becoming increasingly evidence-based. The same should apply to the country\u2019s current drug policy. Here\u2019s hoping that the statistics on drug use play a more prominent role in future discussions and evaluations of the intensifying drug war., \u2013, ,Rappler.com,The authors are a group of graduate students from the University of the Philippines.

{"content": "\nIs it wrong for a president to warn the nation that he is poised to declare martial law? My answer is unequivocal: No.      , ,Was the threat for real or not? Hermeneutics has become a very practical discipline in the administration of President Digong, but, unfortunately, Secretary Andanar is definitely no Hermes. ,What we get from the good Secretary of Clarification and Qualification is not what the public hears from the President nor what the ordinary processes of communication and exchange allow us to grasp. When ,President Digong warned, the nation that he was quite prepared to declare martial law if the drug menace turns virulent, Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, Senate President Koko Pimentel, Mr. Andanar and some other administration oracles told us something else!,But is it wrong for a president to warn the nation that he is poised to declare martial law?  My answer is unequivocal: No.  ,The Constitution gives the President the right to declare martial law \u2013 and those who get into fits of paroxysm and froth in the mouth like persons possessed by some malevolent spirit are the purveyors of that reading of martial law, Marcos-era, that paints it all in hues of black and that would impose their version of history on an entire nation. ,I have repeatedly maintained that a historical event admits of different interpretations \u2013 which is not to argue for a relativist concept of historical truth. But it is a definite rejection of pretensions at the absolutist claims of those for whom martial law was unqualified evil!, ,Shackled commander-in-chief,Whenever my students and I reach the part of the Constitution on the emergency powers of the President, I always point out the congenital deformity of provisions crafted in dislike for Marcos and for martial law. Under the present provision, a president\u2019s hands are not only tied. The commander-in-chief is in fact shackled: Congress has the power to review the declaration of Martial Law, and even set it aside, and any interested citizen may question the factual basis for its declaration before the Supreme Court that may also nullify it. ,These restrictions, I have insisted, are a disservice in fact to the Constitution, for it can so easily occur to any president faced with a grave peril to the nation, that the most expedient recourse left to him protect the Republic without being stymied in his efforts by restrictive provisions is by sweeping aside the entire Constitution \u2013 and then of course, it is \u201canything goes\u201d in a revolutionary, extra-constitutional situation!  The point is to keep the Constitution \u2013 and its interpretation by our courts \u2013 sufficiently pliant so as to keep executive (and all government action) within its bounds!,Whether or not the conditions laid down in the Constitution for the declaration of martial law now exist is a different question, and I do not think they do. And I roundly reject the proposal to characterize the operation of foreign drug syndicates in the country as \u201cinvasion.\u201d There is a legally accepted definition of \u201cinvasion\u201d as of \u201crebellion,\u201d and it never serves the purposes of law well to trifle with terms and their definitions.,Martial law need not be evil. The abuse of freedoms and liberties can, especially when such rambunctiousness becomes pernicious to the viability of the Republic and a threat to the rights of others. It is they who steadfastly reject the possibility of martial law and would stay the hand of a president poised to declare it under all circumstances who must learn the ways of the Constitution again. ,There is, after all, an irreplaceable role of force in the rule of law. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ,The author is Dean, Graduate School of Law, San Beda College, and professor at the Cagayan State University., , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/158590-paranoid-over-martial-law", "title": "Paranoid over martial law", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156674-duterte-christmas-eve-photos,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/nation/158376-duterte-declare-martial-law-want-to"},

Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte appears to be testing presidential waters. File photo by Gualberto Laput   ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 For the first time, Davao City ,Mayor Rodrigo \u201cRody\u201d Duterte, of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipinas-Lakas figured in presidential preferences for 2016.,The tough-talking Duterte has been pushing for federalism, saying it will, help solve, the peace and order problem in Mindanao, the Philippines' poorest island group that has been plagued by a 4-decade-old Muslim secessionist movement.,Nationwide, 12% of respondents said in a Pulse Asia March 1-7, 2015 survey on presidential preferences, they would vote for him as president. An equal number said they would vote for Manila Mayor and former President Joseph \u201cErap\u201d Estrada.,The two are tied at 3rd place after front runner Vice President Jejomar \u201cJojo\u201d Binay, who garnered 29%, and Senator Grace Poe, who got 14%.,Binay's 29% is 3 percentage points higher than his 26% in November 2014. Since that time, he has been linked to corruption scandals in Makati, including the alleged overpricing of the ,Makati City Hall parking building,.,The survey had a sample size of 1,200 and an error margin of \u00b13%. The error margin indicates a marginal increase for Binay and a marginal decline as well for Poe. But because they moved in different directions, Binay is \"now significantly ahead,\" according to Pulse Asia.,Binay's spokesman Rico Quicho said the survey results reaffirm the \"people's desire for a competent and experienced leader to lead the country forward. Despite the never-ending attacks by political opponents on the accomplishments of the Vice President, the people have come to understand and accept that all these are just loose allegations without any basis in fact and in law.\", ,Support,As expected, Duterte\u2019s support base is in Mindanao, where he was preferred by 34%. Binay was strongest in the Visayas, where he got 35%, while Poe was strongest in the National Capital Region (NCR), where she got 18%. Estrada was strongest also in Mindanao, where he got 18%.,The survey comes after the bloody Mamasapano clash on January 25. The encounter resulted in the death of 67 people, including 44 Special Action Force troopers, 5 civilians, and 18 Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels. Subject of various investigations, the massacre was seen to be the worst political disaster to face the Aquino presidency.,Senate investigations led by Poe, who is chair of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, showed that the President \u201c,must bear the responsibility,\u201d for the botched operation. Investigations also revealed that Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II was kept out of the loop. Binay seized the offensive, saying that the Mamasapano incident raises questions about ,Roxas\u2019 leadership,.,In the latest Pulse Asia survey, Roxas placed 6,th, with his 4% rating \u2013 lower compared to his previous rating of 6% in the ,November 14-20, 2014, survey,. In that same November survey, Poe rated higher at 18%. Binay got 26% compared to his latest 29% rating.,The entry of Duterte eased out Senator ,Francis \u201cChiz\u201d Escudero,, who wed celebrity Heart Evangelista in a grand Balesin Island Club ceremony only last February. He tied Roxas at 6,th, spot with his 4% rating. In the previous November survey, Escudero was in the top 5 with 7%. ,Senator ,Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr,, who chairs the Senate ,committee on local government, and public works, entered the top 5 presidential preferences list with his 6% rating, higher than his previous 4%. He previously ranked 7,th,.,Scoring higher than Marcos in the March survey was Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago, whose 9% rating was lower than her previous 12%. Santiago ranked 4,th, after Estrada and Duterte, followed by Marcos at 5,th,.,Senator Alan Peter Cayetano took the 7,th, spot with 3%, followed by Senator Antonio \u201cSonny\u201d Trillanes IV with 2%, former rehabilitation secretary Panfilo \u201cPing\u201d Lacson with 1%, and former senator Richard \u201cDick\u201d Gordon also with 1%.,Vice-presidential preference, ,For vice president, the top choice was Poe with 29%, followed by Escudero with 16%, Cayetano with 13%, and Duterte and Marcos, both tied with 11%.,Trillanes got 6%, followed by detained Senator Jinggoy Estrada with 4%, Senate President Franklin Drilon with 3%, detained Senator Ramon \"Bong\" Revilla Jr with 2%, and Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Leni Robredo with 0.4%. ,The Pulse Asia ,March 1-7 survey on senatorial preferences, showed Senator Vicente \"Tito\" Sotto and former Rehabilitation Secretary Panfilo \"Ping\" Lacson still leading the list of voter choices, as in the November 2014 poll.  \u2013 ,Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/87143-duterte-ranks-3-presidential-preference-poll", "title": "Duterte is No. 3 in presidential preference poll", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/nation/84620-rodrigo-duterte-pdp-laban,http://www.rappler.com/nation/83834-mindanao-boiling-violence-may-erupt-duterte"},

That's the only way,\" Duterte said. ,Duterte on Tuesday evening, May 23, ,ended up declaring martial law, in Mindanao as clashes erupted between the Philippine military and local terrorist groups in Marawi City.,The clashes began on Tuesday afternoon after the Philippine military ,launched a surgical strike, against \"high-value targets\" belonging to the Abu Sayyaf Group and the Maute Group.

You have to make it easy for them to find you, too. ,Use search engine optimization (SEO). According to a study from Search Engine Watch, the top organic search result on Google ,gets 33% of the traffic,. Succeeding results will get a lower percentage of the pie.,How can you improve your SEO tactics? Keep your site fresh by publishing relevant and regular content.

In 2015, local retailer Zalora ,launched, their first temporary physical space in the Philippines. Shoppers got to try on products, then made their purchases using computers that took the place of checkout counters.,Don\u2019t think opening a pop-up store defeats the purpose of your online one.

Your homepage should give a good first impression.,By showcasing your best products and promos upfront, you\u2019ll encourage visitors to buy, and at the same time, reduce clutter on the page.,Organize, your products in categories. Relevant categories will make the shopping experience much better because they help streamline your customer\u2019s search.,Make sure that all necessary info \u2013 such as name, price, dimensions, features, and materials \u2013 are available on the product page.,A complicated checkout page will push shoppers to abandon their carts.

You can do this across all purchases, for a certain total bill reached, or as a seasonal promo.,Can you offer express shipping as well? It takes about 1-7 business days for packages to be delivered in the Metro Manila area and 5-12 business days for addresses outside of it.

Justice remains elusive for victims of the Maguindanao massacre. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 After two presidents, the Philippines' worst case of election-related violence has yet to achieve closure. ,In 2009, then-Buluan vice mayor Esmael Mangudadatu challenged Andal Ampatuan Jr, a member of the powerful Ampatuan clan in Mindanao, for the position of governor.,His supporters, family, and members of the media were on their way to the provincial capitol for the filing of Mangudadatu's certificate of candidacy when the convoy was attacked. 58 people \u2013 including 32 journalists \u2013 were killed in Sitio Masalay, Barangay Salman, Ampatuan, Maguindanao.,November 23, 2016 marks the 7th year since the tragedy, which the Committee to Protect Journalists has called the single deadliest attack against the media.,But to date, no one has been convicted over the massacre. There are 197 accused in the case, and 106 remain on trial before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 221. But one of the main suspects, Ampatuan clan patriarch Andal Ampatuan Sr, had already ,died in July 2015,.  ,Former president Benigno Aquino III drew flak for ,failing to act quickly, to resolve the case, with critics pointing out that he failed to do so within his 6-year term. (READ: ,6 updates on Maguindanao massacre's 6th year,) ,But with a new administration now in power, the families of the victims have pinned their hopes on President Rodrigo Duterte for a resolved case.,Presidential spokesman,Several days after Duterte's win in the May 2016 polls, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines expressed \"serious misgivings\" when it was announced that lawyer Salvador Panelo was to ,become Duterte's spokesman,. ,In 2014, Panelo was hired as defense lawyer of Ampatuan Jr. He had been quoted in a ,Philippine Star ,article, as saying that the Ampatuans were innocent, and that they were \"framed to seize political power.\" ,He withdrew as legal counsel in 2015 as requested by his client due to \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d (READ: ,Duterte's spokesman Salvador Panelo and his high-profile cases,) ,But Panelo ,downplayed these concerns,, saying in a May 2016 interview: \"We will make sure that justice will be given to everyone under the law.\"  ,He also said that the President was not the kind of man who could be easily influenced or one who was sought for favors.,Task force on media killings,In mid-July, Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said a presidential task force was set to be created to work on cases of killings involving members of the media.,Speaking over state-run radio dzRB, Andanar said that solving the Maguindanao massacre \"has always been the cry of the people of the media and concerned quarters of the country.\",\"It's about time, and I believe that the current justice secretary also would agree with me, we should [look at] past cases and give justice to families who have been victimized by overdue process,\" he added.

Instead of [them] fulfilling long-lasting and wide-reaching programs, [they] are only implementing projects that are after photo-ops [and] are no longer helpful,\" he said.,Aquino said the focus of leaders should instead be on serving the people.

The total amount of requested funds so far has reached P600 million.,\"Because you have submitted your program of works, the DILG commits to releasing the funds 10 days since your submission,\" he said, which was greeted with applause.,But he also reminded the LGUs to start preparing for the upcoming typhoon season.

The Senate blue ribbon subcommittee finally releases a partial report after 10 months of hearings. Photo by Alex Nuevaespa\u00f1a/Senate PRIB ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 After 10 months and 21 hearings, the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee finally came out with a partial report recommending plunder charges against Vice President Jejomar Binay and his son.  ,Panel chairman Senator Aquilino Pimentel III drafted the report asking the Ombudsman to file plunder charges against Binay, his son Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin \u201cJunjun\u201d Binay Jr, and co-conspirators over the allegedly overpriced ,Makati City Hall parking building II.,The report found \u201ca system of corruption\u201d in the infrastructure project worth ,P2.276 billion ($51.7 million).,Pimentel is among 4 senators who have signed the report as of Thursday, May 28. The others are rumored presidential bet and Binay challenger Senator Grace Poe, and senators Alan Peter Cayetano, and Antonio Trillanes IV. ,\u201cI just submitted my partial subcommittee report because it's ripe to submit one,\u201d Pimentel told reporters. \u201cIt was time to make the report on the Makati parking building because we have heard it sufficiently. Others will follow.\u201d ,Pimentel said 4 senators have signed the report but did not name the two others. He also said only Senate blue ribbon committee chairman Teofisto Guingona III can discuss the contents of the report. ,Yet a copy of the report seen by Rappler showed that father and son Binay should face plunder charges for signing documents as the agency heads for preliminary services for the parking building. The building was first constructed in 2007, when the elder Binay was mayor, and was finished in 2013 after his son took over in 2010.,The same building is the subject of a ,plunder complaint, lawyer Renato Bondal filed against the Binays in July 2014. The Ombudsman ,suspended the younger Binay, as it investigates the case, but the Binays questioned the suspension before the Supreme Court. ,The subcommittee also recommended the filing of plunder cases against members of Makati City Hall's Bids and Awards Committee, resident auditors of the Commission on Audit, and the contractor, Hilmarc's Construction Corporation. ,Pimentel said a majority or 9 signatures of the 17-member committee is needed for the draft report to be endorsed as the official report of the panel. The report is now being circulated for signatures. It is almost 50 pages long. ,The members of the Senate blue ribbon committee are: ,Of the 17 members, only Pimentel, Cayetano and Trillanes actively participate in the hearings. ,Corruption allegations surrounding the Makati parking building sparked a scandal that exposed multiple anomalies implicating Binay. The Vice President rejects the investigations of various government agencies as tools to derail his 2016 presidential candidacy. ,'Corruption conspiracy' , ,Cayetano said that the hearings clearly established that there was a conspiracy to plunder public funds. ,\u201cWala namang makakatanggap kung walang nagbibigay. Sasabihin ng ,private citizen,, halimbawa, 'Di naman ako kasama diyan, hiningan ako, kontratisa ako eh.' Eh nagbigay ka eh. Pwede bang 'di ka kumita, 'di mo tinaas ang halaga ng kontrata?\u201d ,(No one will receive kickbacks if no one gave money. A private citizen, for example, can say, 'I am not part of that, they just asked me as a contractor.' But you gave money. How can you not earn when you raised the price of the contract?) ,Cayetano said that the Senate investigation showed that the bidding was rigged, Hilmarc's was favored, kickbacks were received, and that the project was \u201cchop-chopped\u201d into 5 phases. (READ: ,Red flags in 'overpriced' Makati infra projects,),\u201cThere were many admissions. For example, the architect said that just how many days or weeks before the bidding, they already discussed this, and there was no soil test. All this will tell you whether there was an anomaly or not,\u201d Cayetano said. ,The report will pressure other senators to reveal their stand on the corruption allegations against the Vice President after skipping one of the most politically sensitive Senate inquiries all this time. ,Pimentel could not say if his report will gain enough support but Cayetano was optimistic. ,Cayetano said: \u201cGiven the encouragement we were given for the months we were hearing, many on the floor said, 'You're doing a good job. Keep it up,' given the facts here in the carpark building, and given the people whispering to the chairman that they will support, I expect to make the number.\u201d ,\u201cLet them read it, maybe they agree with the conclusion, I'm confident the report is thorough.\u201d ,Binay camp: How earthshaking! ,Even before it was released, the Binay camp already ridiculed the report, and branded it anti-climactic. ,Binay spokesperson JV Bautista questioned the purpose of the report considering that the Binays already face a plunder complaint over the same building. ,\u201cWow, that's earthshaking. What a revelation! The issuance of a partial report is only an indication that they don't intend to stop this witch hunt, which is a pathetic exercise in utter futility,\u201d Bautista said in a press briefing at the Senate before the start of the 21,st, hearing on Thursday. ,He added: \u201cWhat is the sense of their recommendation if their recommendation is already being implemented? ,Naiwanan na ho sila ng bangka, (The boat has already left them behind).\" ,Cayetano responded that there is still no court case. He added that even if a case is already pending in court, the Senate has the power to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation. ,The Binay camp also asked how much the Senate is spending just to \u201cdestroy the name of Vice President Binay.\u201d  ,Pimentel shot back: \u201c,Ang tanong ko, magkano na ba ang natitipid nila sa kaka-presscon ,inside the Senate?, Ang amin, trabaho eh, (My question is: how much have they saved by holding press conferences in the Senate?

The girl would stay with the congressman for P5,000/day. This was not the first time the girl was sold for sex. At age 9, she was prostituted to a tourist. \u201cNo\u201d is useless, the girl learned. Refusal meant a punch in the head, it meant hunger, it meant guilt \u2013 the money paid for her needs, after all, the pimp insisted.,The rapes began in June and ended in August, when the girl managed to escape and report to the police.,I did not force her, the pimp argued. Political blackmail, the congressman claimed. Both were found guilty: the ,pimp, for child prostitution, the ,congressman, for statutory rape and acts of lasciviousness. Both were eventually freed.,The old story remains fresh in the minds of advocates. Others, however, may have already forgotten the case and the fact that several other children are sold for sex here and abroad.,Kids, sex, sale,SEX. DSWD handled 180 cases of sexually exploited children in 2014, however, many other cases go unreported.    ,Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) is a \u201csignificant problem\u201d in the Philippines, the US Department of Labor ,reported, in 2012.,CSEC happens when ,minors, engage in sexual activities \u2013 prostitution, pornography, sex tourism, trafficking or forced marriage for sexual purposes \u2013 for cash or other material payments, UNICEF explained. Third parties like pimps usually profit from such transactions.,The number of sexually exploited children has fluctuated over the years, according to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).,(Source: NSCB, DSWD),In 2014, 33% of these children were under 14.,Majority are ,girls,, statistics show, but boys are victims too. \u201cConfiding about abuse seems harder for boys,\u201d said Dolores Alforte, executive director of ,ECPAT Philippines,, an international non-governmental organization protecting children\u2019s rights., ,\u201cOnly reported cases are indicated in official statistics but for every one report, there are hundreds more that are unreported,\u201d the Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC) stressed., ,CSEC threatens children\u2019s \u201cphysical and psychosocial integrity,\u201d ECPAT believes. It also puts children at higher risk of physical violence, unwanted pregnancies, and sexually transmitted diseases, the ,International Labor Organization, (ILO) observed. From 1984 to 2012, over 8,000 abused Filipino children were reported to have AIDS/HIV, CWC reported.,Those vulnerable to CSEC include the ,abandoned,, migrants, drop-outs, ,homeless,, and laborers. Children from dysfunctional families or have sex workers as guardians are also at risk, ILO added., ,But poverty remains the biggest factor. Children feel obligated or are forced to earn.,In the Philippines, children are the 3rd poorest basic sector, next to fishers and farmers, the National Statistical Coordination Board revealed. Their poverty incidence has not changed in the past 6 years., ,(Source: NSCB),All these can disrupt children\u2019s education, limiting their opportunities as adults. Although some children successfully break out of the sex trade, others are caught in a cycle. ,Child sex tourism, ,The Philippines is seen as a \u201ctraditional child sex tourism destination\u201d by offenders, ECPAT observed. Accommodations, transportation, and other related services are all involved in sex tourism. Hence, it is not only the customer who commits crime, but everyone who helps facilitate. ,\u201cIt\u2019s no longer true that children are only trafficked from provinces to Manila, it\u2019s also vice-versa,\u201d Alforte stressed. Famous travel destinations can be hotspots, ECPAT found, such as Puerto Princesa, Boracay, and Panglao. ,Tourists \u2013 foreign and local alike \u2013 usually pick up children from clubs, karaoke bars, discos, or massage parlors, and take them to resorts or hotels. Some tour guides, drivers, waiters, motel staff and guards act as pimps. Peak seasons stretch from October to May.,Children entertain at least one to two customers daily, ECPAT observed in Boracay. Some work twice a week, others every day. Most work late into the night since competition is tough., ,Some work solo, others have pimps. Many were lured by promises of overseas jobs, but ended up as sex workers. They live in makeshift dorms, usually located behind resorts, similar to brothels. Their earnings \u2013 sometimes big, sometimes small \u2013 support themselves and the families they left behind., ,INTERNET. Children may also fall victim to predators online. Advocates advise parents and communities to monitor how children spend their free time   ,Some offenders \u201cgroom\u201d, or shower with presents, children before the abuse, as a way of earning their or their family\u2019s trust.

The problem is that not everyone cooperates. Many hotels turn a blind eye in the name of profit, failing to help prevent or report abuse. \u201cSome bribe the front desk to keep quiet,\u201d Alforte said. \u201cThe Department of Tourism and LGUs should include child protection as a requirement for business permits.\u201d,In fact, the congressman's months-long rapes happened inside a fancy condominium.,All these still happen despite the country's ,laws, prohibiting establishments from promoting or facilitating trafficking and sex tourism.,Citizens are also advised to be more proactive in preventing child abuse.

{"content": "\n'We have learned that the only way to deal with the inefficiency of our roads is to simply avoid them. Our \"solution\" to city flooding is to simply not go outside.'\n,Why is this so? We collectively shrug and say, \",Ganyan talaga, (That's just how it is).\" We are done finding solutions and have given up even identifying the problem. Instead we \"fix\" our situation using things we can control. In order to get to a certain destination, we just leave in the wee hours of the morning. We allow an absurd two hours for a 10-km ride. We avoid certain areas and choose to conduct business or socialize closer to where we are. Worse, instead of rushing home to our families, we stay at work late, or hang out until traffic subsides. We have learned that the only way to deal with the inefficiency of our roads is to simply avoid them. Our \"solution\" to city flooding is to simply not go outside.,Those who don't have the luxury of options have no choice but to deal with the everyday struggle of their commute. It has gotten so bad that ,merely trying to get from work to home is considered a form of class violence,. Sorry ,na lang, for those who have no other way to make a living than to traverse the major thoroughfares or use public transportation., Pasensiya na lang, (just have patience) if you're one of these unfortunate souls who do have to make it to work every day.,Turning a blind eye,Our public officials turn a blind eye because they're not directly affected. Even if they are, and even if they honestly want to make an effort to help others, there are too many layers of bureaucracy to even try to chip away at the hardened red tape that runs our lives. Where do we even begin solving the problem of flooding? ,Banning plastic bags, is a popular and political Band-Aid solution, even if we all know that ,large-scale urban planning is needed to address the floods ,that have become a way of life.,Besides, who is really affected? Just those who don't have any power or means to exempt themselves from this regular onslaught. Metro Manila's problem of public transportation and flooding is so great that addressing its causes requires a plan spanning decades. No administration or candidate would benefit from including it in his or her platform, and for most of them that's enough reason to not act on such hopeless concerns., ,Learned helplessness,The metropolis has gotten used to this daily ordeal and its inhabitants have merely accepted it as a part of life. It calls to mind the psychological theory of, learned helplessness,, where an individual forced to repeatedly endure unpleasant situations becomes unwilling to avoid them (even if they have a choice) because he or she believes that such situations are beyond their control.,We are these individuals forced to endure the suffering of dangerous railways, severe traffic, flooding, and other inconveniences of city living. Metro Manila residents often feel battered and exhausted by their daily grind just from the hassle of getting to and from work. But because of the hopelessness of the situation, we simply continue on. Workers instead leave earlier and work later. We just sleep, text, or rant online during traffic jams. We post photos of flooded streets, give each other traffic advice, and wish each other safe travels on our grueling commutes home.,We simply adapt, move our business and work days around, or take the day off when we can. We turn a blind eye ourselves. Faced with this daily torture, it becomes a matter of sanity not to dwell on this despondency and be consumed by it all of our waking hours. We put this hopelessness behind us and try to enjoy the remaining hours of the evening to get a few hours of sleep, even if it means we get to do it all over again the next day.,\",Ganyan talaga, eh.,\",A few years ago, I wrote about the ,relativity of discomfort, when the memory of living in Manila was still fresh. I couldn't understand why Americans were so impatient about every little thing. I bragged about being able to endure my three-hour daily commute between Ayala and Quezon City. I said that there was just no way out of it except to be patient. Like many, I had made peace with the unsolvable problem that was already evident (though not as severe) 13 years ago.,Having been deprived of this daily challenge for over a decade and encountering it only during visits home, I realize how we have become captive to the inefficiency of our local governments who appear ruthless in subjecting us to this daily torture. Metro Manile\u00f1os appear to collectively suffer from a kind of ,Stockholm Syndrome,, in that we have gotten so used to the daily suffering that we've begun to worship our captors for the occasional small mercies of having only half as much traffic or just minor flooding, or if they happen to sing and dance for us on the campaign trail.,We've forgotten what we're entitled to. We choose to forget that a convenient way of getting to and from our sources of livelihood is our right. We accept the annual flooding of our homes as our fault for living in low-lying areas. We instead clap when a politician delivers \"relief\" goods after a storm. Isn't the true \"relief\" not having to be displaced by a storm in the first place?,It's so difficult to reconcile ourselves with what we deserve when the idea of getting it is so out of reach.,The inaudible drone of suffering,Maybe if leaders realize that the, cost of traffic jams amounts to P 2.4 billion per day,, they would have more of a stake in it rather than just pegging it on the happiness of their constituents they obviously aren't bothered about. The suffering of our working class has become such a constant drone that it's become inaudible when lumped with the rest of the country's problems.,We tend to listen instead to those who have loud voices and bigger stages, or at least something new to say. We tend to shrug and get on with our lives.,How can we not, when there are bills to pay, work days to get to and get home from, and children to feed? We are so used to the inconvenience of Metro Manila living that we've become thankful for just making it home alive. ,\u2013, ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/103186-learned-helplessness-metro-manila", "title": "The learned helplessness of Metro Manila", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/ph-travel/133388-visayas-travel-destinations-beaches-falls-caves,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/55402-mrt-violence-of-mass-transport-system,http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/31549-plastic-ban-affects-20-of-plastics-industry%20"},
{"content": "\nThe 100-minute-long speech is delivered in English, and punctuated by ad-libs in Filipino and Bisaya     , ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 ,Trusted by practically all Filipinos,, President Rodrigo Duterte delivered on Monday, July 25, his first State of the Nation Address (SONA), making major policy pronouncements on the ,peace negotiations,, the anti-drug war, income tax reform, and transportation, ,among others. ,Here is the full text of the 100-minute-long speech, as provided by the Malaca\u00f1ang. Duterte delivered it in English, punctuated by ad-libs in Filipino and a bit of Bisaya. ,***,Kindly sit down. Thank you. ,Allow me a little bit of informality at the outset. You would realize that the three guys in the elevated portion of Congress are from Mindanao. So, wala talaga kaming masabi. [applause],Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, members of the Senate, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the members of the House of Representatives, Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, President Fidel V. Ramos, President Joseph Estrada, President Arroyo, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, and justices of Supreme Court, His Excellency Papal Nuncio and members of the diplomatic corps.,We cannot... Well, of course, I have also to greet the Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, the members of the Cabinet, fellow workers in government, my countrymen.,We cannot move forward if we allow the past to pull us back.  Finger-pointing is not the way. That is why I will not waste precious time dwelling on the sins of the past or blaming those who are perceived to be responsible for the mess that we are in and suffering from.,Except maybe extract a lesson or two from its errors we will not tarry because it is the present that we are concerned with and the future that we should be prepared for.,Lest I be misunderstood, let me say clearly, that those who betrayed the people\u2019s trust shall not go unpunished and they will have their day in Court. [applause] And if the evidence warrants, they will have their day of reckoning too. ,When I decided to seek the presidency of this Republic, I knew what the ills of our country were; I knew their causes; and I was briefed on those who caused the causes.,I heard the people on the streets complain that justice had become illusory; that equity and fairness and speedy disposition of cases had deteriorated into hollow concepts fit only for masteral dissertations. It was, and still is, very sad indeed.,As a former prosecutor, I know there always --- ways of knowing how fast or how slow cases go. What I did was to look into the number of postponements and the time difference between each postponement and the next setting.  It was simple as that. I will appreciate deeply if we all in government attend to this urgent need.,I was determined then as I am now determined and better positioned, to wage war against those who make a mockery of our laws including those who make life for us all miserable.,I wish to assure everyone though that vindictiveness is not in my system. [applause] Just like you and I, all, equal treatment and equal protection are what I ask for our people. [applause],But we must have the courage to fight for what we believe in, undeterred by the fear of failing or losing. Indeed, courage knows no limits, cowardice does. [applause],At this point, there are concerns few I wish to convey to all to the end that as I perorate on facts, figures, plans, programs, and solutions, these concerns will not dissipate or get lost along our way.,Thus to our religious bishops, leaders, priests, pastors, preachers, imams let me assure you that while I am a stickler for the principle of separation between church and state, I believe quite strongly that there should never be a separation between God and State. [applause],During my inauguration last 30 [June] 2016, I said that the fight against criminality and illegal drugs and corruption will be relentless and sustained. I reiterate that commitment today. And that is why I call on the Philippine National Police, the barangay chairmen, the Mayors, and Governors and all those occupying seats of power and authority, not to lower their guard. There will be no let-up in this campaign.  Double your efforts. Triple them, if need be.  We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier, and the last pusher have surrendered or put behind bars [applause] or below the ground, if they so wish. [applause],To our police officers and other officials, do your job and you will have the unwavering support of the Office of the President. [applause] I will be with you all the way.  Abuse your authority, and there will be a hell to pay, [applause] for you will have become worse than criminality itself.,I order the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) to hasten the conduct of investigation and adjudication of administrative cases  against police officers involved in criminal activities and illegal activities and prescribe policies on lifestyle checks for PNP members.,In this quest, I will put at stake my honor, my life, and the presidency itself. [applause],The DILG is also directed to strictly monitor how LGUs perform their supervision functions of the police and those found not performing will be sanctioned including the loss of police deputation from the NAPOLCOM. Let me repeat my warning to all: Do not do drugs [applause] because you will be the solution to the drug crisis that has engulfed \u2013 malawak \u2013 the nation.,We will create an Inter-Agency Committee on Illegal Drugs that will integrate efforts and strengthen the partnership of all stakeholders.,The reservists will be mobilized for information campaign against drug use and the dissemination of information regarding drug rehabilitation programs being offered by the government. Let us also strengthen our ROTC Program to instill love of country and good citizenship. [applause],We will also prioritize the rehabilitation of drug users.  We will increase the number of residential treatment and rehabilitation facilities in all regions of the country.  [applause] The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will facilitate the preparation for the use of military camps and facilities for drug rehabilitation. [applause],There can never be real, tangible and felt development without making our people feel secure and it is our duty to uplift the people\u2019s welfare.,With this, my administration shall be sensitive to the State\u2019s obligations to promote, and protect, fulfill the human rights of our citizens, especially the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable and social justice will be pursued, even as the rule of law shall at all times prevail.,My administration shall implement a human approach to development and governance, as we improve our people\u2019s welfare in the areas of health, education, adequate food and housing, environmental preservation, and respect for culture.,Human rights must work to uplift human dignity. [applause] But human rights cannot be used as a shield or an excuse to destroy the country --- your country and my country. [applause],Meantime, since our country continues to be confronted with internal security threats aggravated by the existence and activities of the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf, the full force of the AFP will be applied to crush these criminals who operate under the guise of religious fervor. The AFP shall enhance its capability to search and engage these rogue and lawless elements.,We have to strengthen our coordination with Indonesia and Malaysia to suppress the kidnappings in the waters of our neighboring countries. We will strengthen our counter-terrorism programs by amending various laws on human terrorism, terrorism financing and cybercrime.,This is our answer to the challenges of the global development\u2019s non-traditional threats, transnational crimes and fanatical terrorism. Addressing global warming shall all will be our top priority, but upon a fair and equitable equation. [applause] It must not stymie our industrialization.,We also endeavor to develop and corporate partnerships with nations sharing common interests and concerns with the Philippines; maintain and sustain bilateral and multilateral consultations and dialogues.,We will continue to expand cooperation on human assistance, disaster response, maritime security and counter terrorism. We shall deepen security dialogues with other nations to build greater understanding and cooperation.,With regard to the West Philippine Sea otherwise known as [South] China Sea, we strongly affirm and respect the outcome of the case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration as an important contribution to the ongoing efforts to pursue the peaceful resolution and management of our disputes. [applause],On the aspect of our peace processes relating to our engagement with the international community, the Philippines shall remain committed to work under and with international partners achieving lasting peace and progress in the country.,We will vigorously address the grievances that have been time and again expressed, not only by the Bangsamoro, indigenous peoples and other groups for security, development, fair access to decision-making and acceptance of identities. ,Enduring peace can only be attained only if we meet these fundamental needs of every man, woman and child. [applause],To our Muslim brothers, the Moro country, and the members of the CPP/NPA/NDF, let me say this:,All of us want peace, not the peace of the dead, but the peace of the living. [applause] We express our willingness and readiness to go to the negotiating table, and yet we load our guns, fix our sights, pull the trigger. It is both ironic and tragic \u2013 and it is endless.  While we extol the bravery and heroism of our soldiers \u2014 kayo the rebels \u2013 do the same for the members and fighters.  What I see instead are the widows and the orphans. And I feel their pain and grief.  And no amount of cash assistance or the number of medals can compensate the loss of a human life. [applause] Sorrow cuts across every stratum of society. It cuts deeply and the pain lasts forever.,That is why, I reach out to you,  to all of you today. To our Muslim brothers, let us end the centuries of mistrust and warfare.  To the CPP/NPA/NDF, let us end these decades of ambuscades and skirmishes. We are going nowhere. And it is getting bloodier by the day.,To immediately stop violence on the ground, restore peace in the communities and provide enabling environment conducive to the resumption of the peace talks, I am now announcing a unilateral ceasefire with the CPP/NPA/NDF effective immediately.  [applause] And call on our Filipinos in the National Democratic Front and its forces to respond accordingly.,Let me make this appeal to you: \u201cIf we cannot, as yet, love one another,  then in God\u2019s name,  let us not hate each other too much,\u201d so it was said. [applause] I say the same to you today. ,We will strive to have a permanent and lasting peace before my term ends. That is my goal, that is my dream. [applause],On the macroeconomic management, my administration will continue and maintain current macroeconomic policies, and even do better. We will achieve this through prudent fiscal and monetary policies that can help translate high growth  into more and better job creation and poverty reduction.  By the end of my term, I hope \u2013 I hope and pray \u2013 to hand over an economy that is much stronger,  characterized by solid growth, low and stable inflation,  dollar reserves, and robust fiscal position.,On taxation, my administration will pursue tax reforms  towards a simpler, and more equitable, and more efficient tax system  that can foster investment and job creation.  We will lower personal and corporate income tax rates [applause] and relax the bank secrecy laws. [applause] Eh na-Presidente ako eh. Ayaw ko sana makialam dito sa mga \u2018to. Alam mo na. Well, anyway. May I continue.,At the household level,  there must be sufficient income for all Filipinos to meet the basic food and non-food needs for their families.  We shall continue attract investments that will generate thousands of jobs each year \u2013 jobs that are suitable for the poor and less skilled members of the workforce.,Reforms to ensure competitiveness and promote ease of doing business will be mandatory. [applause] Reacting to these needs, the restrictions on the economy will be needed  to make more investments to come and to develop labor-intensive industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and tourism shall be pursued.,We must also invest in human capital and ensure equal access to economic opportunities.,The implementation of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law must be put into full force and effect [applause] so that couples, especially the poor, will have freedom of informed choice  on the number and spacing of children they can adequately care and provide for, [applause] eventually making them more productive members of the labor force.,When employment is not an option,  for instance in extremely rural neighborhoods,  entrepreneurship will be advocated.  ,We shall also enhance local business environment  by addressing bottlenecks in business registration and processing,  streamlining investment application process and integration the services of various government offices. ,Government Financing Institutions (GFIs) shall come up with out-of-the box financing packages to capacitate our small and medium entrepreneurs.,In the field of tourism, we shall construct more access roads and tourism gateways to service centers and tourist sites.,Road development projects shall complement  with our thrust to provide modern agriculture, infrastructural by expanding and improving the construction and rehabilitation of roads and the irrigation and establishing modern harvest and post-harvest facilities to minimize losses.,We shall also conduct a nationwide soil analysis  to determine areas most suitable for rice farming to optimize production  with the use of effective soil rehabilitation and fertilization.,We shall strictly enforce fisheries laws,  particularly on illegal fishing  and promote aquaculture along river banks and in backyards.,On the other hand, we will accelerate infrastructure spending by improving national roads and bridges and implementing the Mindanao Logistics Infrastructure Network [applause] and other road network master plans.  We shall pursue inter-island linkage projects.,We shall be implementing structural mitigation measures  to address of the perennial flooding in Metro Manila and neighboring areas. [applause] We shall put up new pumping stations in strategic places.,The revival of the operation of the Pasig River Ferry Service System  is a viable option for the severe traffic congestion in Metro Manila. ,This serves as an alternative mode of transportation  for passengers particularly those coming  from the east side of Metro to reach specific destinations within the cities of Manila, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Taguig, Marikina and Quezon City.,Our anti-colorum campaign and out-of-line apprehension including the removal of terminals will be intensified and, my God, it will be done. [applause] Immediately, immediately.,To address lack of road infrastructure in Metro Manila,  usage of existing roads will be maximized.  Thus, there is a need to cooperate and coordinate with LGUs  to map out secondary routes and to consult various stakeholders, including the public transport operators. ,Many in government opine realistically, and I would have to agree, that the worsening traffic situation could be logically addressed, if Congress would also accord emergency powers to the agencies concerned.  [applause],Ayaw mo? Okay lang rin. Para makita namin kung gusto ninyong madalian. Alam naman talaga ninyo sagad na lahat, sagad na. Nasa inyo \u2018yan. If you give it, fine. If you don\u2019t, we take the longer route, slowly. And tanggapin ko \u2018yung pag-mumura ninyo. \u2018Wag lang sa malapit. [laughter] Eh ganun talaga eh. You\u2019ve done it. It's an urgent and immediate situation, solution. Gusto ninyo madali lang, okay. Kapag ayaw naman ninyo, because baka sabihin niyo graft and corruption eh \u2018di okay. But I assure you \u2014 wala ito sa script \u2014 I assure you, this will be a clean government. [applause],If that is the only worry that you have and I can understand your misgiving. Wala na ito sa... ang haba. [laughter] Wala na ito sa script. You know, ako maka-garantiya, 101 percent it will be clean. The problem is I can only act through agencies and departments. That\u2019s why I urge you na maski konting mali lang,  wala akong ano sa inyo, wala na akong politika, wala na. I\u2019m through after this.  I just pass on to you the information that, you know\u2026 I act through secretaries and... I cannot guarantee their honesty and competence at all times. Cabinet members, yes.  Pero yung sa baba \u2014 yung procurement, yung magbi-bidding diyan. But as far as I can really ---  malinis talaga \u2018to. At napag-usapan namin sa likod about the federal system.,You know my advice to you is maintain a federal system, a parliament, but be sure to have a president. Huwag\u2026 Hindi na ako niyan. [applause] I\u2019m disqualified and by that time I would longer be here. But, I can commit today to the Republic of the Philippines and its people: If you hurry up the federal system of government and you can submit it to the Filipino people by the fourth, fifth year, proseso \u2018yan e. You call for a referendum and after that call for a presidential election, I will go. Sibat na ako. But you just have a president. You copy the France system. Huwag mo hayaan yung puro na parliament. Delikado iyon. It takes time even for the\u2026 Iyong kagaya ng England noon. There was this bomb, double deck. It took them time really. There\u2019s no one apparatus for a commander-in-chief down.  You can have a president you can elect. Maybe Tito Sotto would be the lucky guy at that time. O, \u2018di, limitahan mo lang. Ceremonial powers. Power to dissolve, power to accept the resolution or whatever, mandating you this, do that, or ceremonial powers except yung in times of need, if there\u2019s a demand for action. You must have a president. Wala na ako niyan. I said if you can give me that document, I will urge you to conduct a ---  to order  --- to order, call for an election the following day, following week. And even if there is still two years, three years I will go. Okay na ako. Do not worry about me. I don't aim to that much ambition. Eh nanalo ka eh. Hindi ko nga alam bakit nandito ako ngayon. Noon nandoon lang ako o. [applause] Totoo man. Sino man nagsuporta sa inyo sa akin dito? Wala man? [laughter] Not a single congressman. Except for two provinces, governor. \u2018Yun lang.

Until now, sa awa ng Diyos.,For the driver\u2019s licenses, its effectiveness will be extended from the current 3-year period to 5 years. [applause],To reduce queuing time at ticketing stations, tickets sa mga train will be made readily available and easily accessible to the riding public kung bilhin mo \u2018yan sa malls, stalls and stores. Eh ipinagbibili mo yung mga sa --- e 'di diyan mo na ibigay at credited. Huwag doon banda sa Recto kasi sigurado pekein \u2018yan. [laughter],May I address again to the Filipino: Ako po\u2019y nagdo-doble ang pagod para sa inyo, para sa kapakanan ng bayan. Seryoso po ako. Kaya yung mga ganun, ticket-ticket at magkaroon ng gulo, huwag ho ninyong gawain yan. Ito na yung warning ko, yon na ang last, wala nang iba, hindi ko na gagawin: Huwag ninyong sirain yung mga bagay-bagay na ginagawa namin para sa kapakanan ng tao. Mabuti ang magka-intindihan tayo [applause].,Mamaya yung kayo --- kaibigan ko --- tangad, tangad, tangad [laughter] Kaya huwag na ninyong gawin. Simple lang \u2018yan eh. Para walang away sa gobyerno, yung mga bagay na illegal at masama at hindi tama, huwag mong gawin, at hindi kami mag-aaway dito [applause]. ,Pati yung pari ha --- pati si Pope tinamaan.

He who is the cause of the cause is the cause of them all. [applause]. Ikaw yung nag umpisa, you swallow ---,Ulitin ko ha: He who is the cause of the cause is the cause of them all. Kami nagta-trabaho lang. We have a mission to God. We have millions of people to see that they are healthy. It\u2019s a question of drug, it\u2019s a question of public interest, public order. Kita mo, lesser crime. Wala na kasing magnanakaw, wala nang naghoholdap. Kasi para ---Bakit tapos sabi nila eh, 'maliliit lang \u2018 yan'. Gamitin mo utak mo.,If you are able to contaminate, kagaya ng negosyo ng mga Chinese, wholesale yan sila. Maski konti-konti kung the whole of Tondo contaminated, pera \u2018yan. I am not saying it's the Chinese. Practice of nitong wholesale, retail. They go for wholesale. Maski na kumita lang ng isang piso diyan sa isang... Okay na yan. Kasi paramihan eh. Iyan ang ibig kong sabihin. ,Now, let...  I hope the military and the police will not react on this. It is part of the deep intelligence that we have gathered. I am forced to come in public, kasi pati yung mga pari nag-aano\u2026 Alam mo kayong mga media, naghahanap kayo ng, \"Where\u2019s the big fish?\" \"Saan yung bilyonaryo na mayaman, yung may kotse, yung may mga Mercedez na yan?\u201d Ma\u2019am, nandoon yan sila sa labas, wala dito.

Gusto niyo, sabihin niyo, puntahan natin, I\u2019ll give you the names. I\u2019ll show you the intelligence paper pero give me the guarantee na may magawain ka. Because I\u2019ll give you the name, I\u2019ll give you the country. Kung wala ka ring magagawa, mag-shut up ka. [laughter]. Kaya hindi lang kami nag... But do not get too personal about our work here. I am saying that dito...

You increase the train speed from 40 [kph] to 60 [kph]. Ang problema nito, yung mga railway na ito [Hindi na ito kasali diyan. Huwag kayong maniwala dito] Two-thirds of these are mine, the other third is yung --- correct yung grammar ko, ayaw lang nila. Sixty kilometers per hour. Problema nito, and you must agree with me, that the rails are quite aged. Most of the rails maybe, doon pa yan sa panahon ni Marcos, Imelda. Nandyan pa. Ngayon, sabi ni Tugade, pagbigay sa akin sabi ko '40 to 60 kilometers per hour.' Sabi ko, \u2018Art, sigurado ka maka-hold ang rail niyan? Baka maputol \u2018yan mag diretso ang train sa Cavite.' [laughter],Diretso ng Cavite, mulipad doon kay Tolentino. [laughter] 'O bakit may train dito sa Tagaytay?' It\u2019s quite fast, quite fast. Sixty kilometers per hour and you are pulling something that\u2019s heavy. When it really moves --- mawala ng ano--- it moves with a speed at a heavy thing at a great speed, ang hirap mong... Sumasadsad kasi mabigat eh and reduce headway time from 5 minutes to 3 minutes. Mahina lang tayo...Ang plano ni Tugade, mahina lang tayo ng one minute sa Hong Kong. Two minutes, sa kanila three minutes eh. Art, ambisyoso ka ah. Kaya mo kaya ito?  ,Specifically for the LRT, the operating hours shall be extended from 9:30 to 10:30 p.m., so marami pang mga bata ang uuwi niyan. [applause] And to absorb more passengers, delays in the procurement of additional trains shall be addressed soonest. Now, iyan ang sinasabi ko, if you want the long way, fine. Wala akong problema. Sabihin ninyo na doon ang --- we go the normal way if we are able to make purchases.  ,Eh ang maganda nito, I have signed the Executive Order sa aming FOI. Naunahan ko kayo.  Iyong inyo...  Nandoon na ang sa akin [applause]. Oo, tapos na ako. Ilabas ko na --- it will be out today. Alam mo sabi ko, unahan na natin itong Congress, puro mayayabang ang mga nandiyan. We grab the --- each other...They say, \"stealing one\u2019s thunder,\" ika nga. Unahan na natin. ,So, we shall also pursue rail projects in Metro Manila and the major key-points in the country including the Mindanao Rail Project [applause]. Hindi ako nagyayabang pero totoo talaga \u2018to. Well, depende sa federal. But six years, lalabas talaga ito. I assure you because it\u2019s going to materialize:  Rail projects,  the Davao Transit System, the Cebu Transit System, the North and South Luzon Railways and the Panay Railways project. Kita mo? Panay. Eh taga saan si ano? Eh 'di Panay. Panay ang bigay natin para\u2026 [laughter and applause] ,Sabihin naman ni Senator Drilon, 'Binack-bite ka dito. Lalagyan daw nung ano, yung island mo ng train. May tawa pa.' Binaback-bite ka dito. Mag-sumbong man 'yan. Tingnan mo 'yan.,Different approaches are also being considered to decongest NAIA including the possible transfer of general aviation. Ito ang...I will... Hindi... Ang style ko kasi ganito...Hindi naman ako... I am not sticking to formalities. Itong trans \u2014 general aviation, alam mo kung sino ang tinatamaan niyan? Kayong mayayaman. Kayong may mga helicopter pati eroplano, ilipat ko kayo. [applause] Alam mo yung general aviation niyo --- mga Learjets, mga 'yung mga sa mga ano kumpanya, ilagay ko kayo sa Batanes para wala masyadong air traffic [applause]. No, I\u2019m offering Sangley Point. [applause] Kasi kahihiyan ko ang isang runway. I can make a new runway there, sabi ng mga aviation experts but tumbok niyan is the Merville Subdivision. Baka isa pa akong runway dito sa Metro Manila.  But if not them, it\u2019s going to be Clark but on a condition that we will have a fast train. Sabi ko kay Art, it will be something like 30. One hour of travel, sabi ko kay Tugade, is not acceptable. Make a rail there bago, marami nang...  [inaudible] is the bullet train. Ilagay mo yan sa Filipino na driver, sutoy talaga kayo doon, maglampas kayo. [laughter] ,The Clark Airport can be utilized to shift some operations of our domestic and international airlines. Moreover, a one-stop shop will be established within the civil aviation complex for the benefit of the Overseas Filipinos. [applause] Ito mangyari na \u2019to: To utilize the Clark Airport, it is necessary to establish... Yung mga, well, you have a rail to connect. [Tapos na yan. Itaas mo na kay na i-Tagalog ko na.] ,In the area of environment, the military is directed to intensify its support [Makinig kayo, sigig tawa diyan] its support role against illegal logging, illegal mining, nandyan pa naman si Gina Lopez, and other destructive practices that aggravate the devastation of our natural resources. [applause] ,I have to protect the country. Many are complaining against the appointment of Gina Lopez. But si Gina pati ako, we share the same paradigm: The interest of the country must come first. But hindi ko naman sinasabi, there\u2019s a law allowing mining. Gina Lopez and I are just telling you: Follow government standards. Do not destroy the environment. Follow it to a tee. [applause] Wala tayong problema. Just pay the correct taxes, follow the standards. Gina is just doing her job. You know, she\u2019s a really a crusader, that is how I describe her persona: Crusader. Sabi ko tama yan. Bakit? Nandiyan ba si Ma\u2019am? Si Gina Lopez? Secretary Lopez, nandiyan? ,[DENR Secretary Lopez stands up and waves],Ganito yan, pumunta siya sa Davao. Gabi na mga 1 o\u2019clock because on the early days of my --- when I won, pero  hindi pa ako nag-oath, marami nang nagpuntahan. Felicitations, congratulations. Eh si ma\u2019am pumunta twice. Every time, she shows me the degradation of [inaudible] Tapos dalawang oras naman mukhang hindi na matapos. Sabi ko, 'Ma\u2019am' [laughter]. Ma'am, do not be offended ha, totoo man. Huwag ka magalit kay --- it\u2019s the truth. So maga-alas tres na, tapos extemporaneous siya, para ring congressman. Sabi ko, \"Ma\u2019am, maga-alas quarto na.\" \"Ma\u2019am, ano kaya kung ikaw na lang ang DENR?\" [applause and laughter],Bigla din siya nagsagot, \u201cTotoo ka?\u201d [laughter] \"Oo.\" Hindi yung \"oo,\"  [laughter]. Sabi niya, \"I will ask the --- I will consult my family and ask my...\" The following day, tawag siya kay --- my aide, kay Bong.  Sabi niya, \u201cBong, okay na, tinanggap na. Sabi ng pamilya ko, okay na.\u201d Sabi ko, \u201cHay, bantay kayo lahat.\u201d [laughter] But you know, I would not be appointing somebody who is alien to my thinking. I would take in somebody who shares my horizons in life, especially yung degradation ng ---,Tama yan. She is a crusader and she will continue. Dito naman eh...The DENR is likewise directed to review all permits granted to the mining, logging and other environmental sensitive activities to ensure compliance with government standards and if warranted, ito na yung pinakamaganda: amend, suspend or revoke permits. Go ahead. [applause],I\u2019d like to thank God that I had this opportunity really --- I never--- wala namang ano, I never thought umabot ako dito. I\u2019ve always... That...Sa isip ko mahirap itong ano. Itong Laguna Lake, naubos ang mga... Wala na ang fishermen. Iyon na lang --- the difference with one big fish pen to the other --- iyon nalang ang sa mga tao. Makita mo sa plane every time I go to Davao, I pass by that lake there. Every time nakita ko, talagang wala ng ano. And the fishermen are complaining about their loss. Talagang wala na sila kasi ang maliit na lugar iyon lang ang kanila. So dito pinaraan ko lang in diplomatic way that the Laguna Lake shall be transformed into a vibrant economic zone showcasing ecotourism by addressing the negative impact of the watershed destruction, land conversion and pollution. Ito ang nilagay ko. This is what I am telling you. The poor fishermen will have priority in its entitlements. [applause],Order to Gina is: Ayusin mo, Ma\u2019am. Huwag mo namang ipitin but they have to reduce the areas of occupation. They cannot have their cake and eat it too. Sila na yung may pera, sila na yung --- this must stop. So kung itanong, 'Sino ang may-ari niyan?' Simple lang: general, mga mayor, governor, baka congressman --- this is not personal. This is something that I feel that I must do because it is the right thing to do. [applause],To have adequate disposal facilities for the Metro Manila Garbage, the final closure and rehabilitation of the Carmona Sanitary Landfill shall be pursued while the adoption of appropriate waste-to-energy facilities will be explored. Marami yan. The technology is coming very fast.,In the area of governance, there is a need to strengthen our efforts along this line. [Itaas mo na. Itaas yang paragraph na yan] Ito... Select the best answer... [Ang taas na. Huh? Mabubuang ka],To better manage public information, a law should be passed \u2013 I\u2019m addressing Congress-- to create the People\u2019s Broadcasting Corporation, replacing PTV-4, [applause] the government-run TV station, which now aims to replicate international government broadcasting networks.  Teams from these international news agencies --- I\u2019d  like to mention those interested BBC --- are set to visit the country soon to train people from government-run channels to observe. Ito ang gusto ko --- tutal pera naman ng tao --- to observe editorial independence through innovative programs [applause] and intelligent treatment and analysis of news reports, as well as developments of national and international significance.,The government\u2019s Bureau of Broadcast Services, better known as the Radyo ng Bayan,  shall undergo upgrading to make it financially viable and dependable for accurate and independent, and enlightening news and commentary. Radyo ng Bayan will be integrated with the PBC.,As we are presently setting up a Presidential Communications Satellite Office in Davao City, PBC will also put up broadcast hubs in the Visayas and Mindanao. [applause] Davao City will also be the first site of the first Muslim channel, to be called Salaam Television, [applause] and the first Lumad channel. [applause],The PCO shall coordinate with the Office of the Executive Secretary and the Presidential Legal Counsel in implementing the recently approved EO on the Freedom of Information. There is an Executive Order, it's out. As an example on the part of the Executive Branch to make transparency and integrity  as yardsticks in government performance, savings and expenses while engaging the public to be vigilant in participating in government programs and projects., ,The PCO, in coordination with the Office of the Executive Secretary, is drafting the Administrative Order on the Task Force on media killings. ,This government does not condone violence and repression of media. [applause] The bona fide media... Bona fide media...Sometimes they pronounce it \"bonafid\". But whatever that thing is, the bona fide media has always been our partner for change. [applause] Medyo klaro yan. Anong gawin mo sa hindi bona fide media? Iyan ang problema. ,To address backlogs and low prosecutorial effectiveness and efficiency,  the investigation and case management processes shall be streamlined including those for illegal drugs and heinous crimes.,To eradicate the prevalent cultures of fear and silence that have hounded our justice system, I asked Congress \u2014 you \u2014 to enact the Whistleblower Protection Law while the present Witness Protection Program shall be strengthened. [applause] [Hirap maging Presidente. Maski dito lang.] [laughter],The number of lawyers and support staff in the PAO \u2014 that is the Public Assistance Office \u2014 regional and districts shall be increased to provide indigents with more access to counsels. [applause],At this stage, I also have directed the DILG to undertake nationwide information and campaign on federalism in partnerships with various alliances and with LGU, civil society, grassroots and faith-based organizations. [applause],Punta muna ako dito ha, itong federalism. Ewan ko kung tama. Alam mo, itong bayan natin, if I may just repeat. I know that you know \u2014 on 1521, Magellan landed in Leyte. [laughter] Kumare ko man ito. [Salamat, mare ha.] [laughter] Mindanao was already Islam by 100 years. So, ano ito, it\u2019s an imperialism thing. There\u2019s a historical injustice committed against the Moro people. We have to correct it. But it is well possible now. Kaya kayong mga kapatid kong mga Moro, alam naman ninyo. Ako, I\u2019m mixed. Migrant ang tatay ko doon. So, mixed-blood ako. Moro pati Christian.  But, you know, intindihin na lang natin ito, that we can return to you all. Iyong nakuha ng mga Amerikano, Espa\u00f1ol, pati yung mga Pilipino, mga kapitalista, those who exploited Mindanao with that thing sloganeering go to Mindanao because it is a land of promise. With the vast entry of so many people, basically coming from the Visayas, magkaroon tayo ng\u2026 We cannot solve it the way you want it to be. We have to understand each other then you have to live with each other, but we will try.,Ang sinasabi kong babalik ako, dahil ako sa federalism. Both Misuari, Sema and all, at least the politiko leaders ng Mindanao will agree to it. We do not...Remember that ako \u2018yung\u2026 Hindi ko dinidikdik yung masyadong Abu Sayyaf because it is really connected with the first talks between Misuari, the President, subsequently President Marcos and now, until now, until now. ,The only way they said that we can have this. Iyong BBL, ibigay na natin, minus the things that you do not want. [applause] Iyong mga Constitutional issues. Tanggalin muna natin. Ibigay ko yung area. Nandiyan na yan eh. So I ask you pass it minus the Constitutional issues that are contentious. [applause] Ibigay na natin at when the federal system comes, isali mo na sa package, together with Misuari. That is the solution for Mindanao. Nothing else. Believe me. Nothing else will do. Please sleep on it, ponder on it, because that\u2019s the only way to proceed.,On the clamor of our citizens for timely issuance of Philippine passports,  the government shall work towards amendment of the 1996 Passport Law  to lengthen the validity of the passports from the current 5 years to 10 years. [applause] Tutal kayo naman ang maggagawa ng batas. You are the ones who will pass the law, even if you make it good for 30 years, okay ako. Bahala kayo. [laughter] Basta, stretch a little bit because five years is just really simply on a regular basis. ,Matagal pa naman itong passport. Mag-apply ako, ten days. Alam mo, I\u2019d like to call the attention of Secretary Yasay. If you go to Davao, look back doon sa\u2026  Look at the back, likod ng nitong mall, yung malaking mall doon. O sige, pangalanan na natin, SM. Doon, yung mga tao nandiyan sa pavement natutulog.,For the many times nadaan ako na walang ulan, doon lang sila because first come, first served. And the only outlet there --- the outlet of your department is yung sa SM. So yung mga, maawa ako. Dito sa side sa Cotabato, lahat ng Cotabato, doon sa Davao. Karamihan yan, walang mga bahay. If you\u2019re an applicant in Davao City, fine. But you know, kung walang, mahirap kasi. Karamihan diyan, mga Moro. Naghihiga lang diyan sa pavement. Nasasaktan talaga ako. Masakit eh. Buong gabi mo hintayin  hanggang mag-bukas yang SM kasi first come, first served. ,Kaya sabi ko\u2026 But that is...I am addressing to all of the Cabinet members: Make use of the computer. I do not want to see people lining up under the heat of the sun.  I do not want people lining up under the rain. [applause] And I want itong labor... Wala na ito sa script. [Iyong prompter natutulog na siguro \u2018to, papindot-pindot diyan.] [laughter],Alam mo, nandiyan naman yan. Sabi ko what I want is a journal. When the applicant presents the documents, give them a shopping list. Do not add or get anything away from it. Iyon lang yon, final. And when he complies with that, that is good. Huwag mo na siyang pabalikin. [applause] Kasi kung mag-tawag yan ng 8888, my God, puntahan ko talaga kayo. Iyan ang bisyo ko noong mayor ako. It will not make a difference mayor o presidente. Puntahan talaga kita, hiyain kita sa maraming tao. And I would publicly ask you: \u201cWhat the hell happened to the procedure?\u201d Pupuntahan ko talaga kayo. Local, barangay, pulis, military, lahat. Bigyan mo ng shopping list, huwag mo ng pabalikin. Because pag mag-tawag ng 8888 yan, tapos makita ko na the grievance is valid, bahala ka. Anong walang panahon? Pupuntahan kita sa opisina mo. [inaudible] Bakit? Bigyan mo ng stub. You have to employ actuarial ability, that\u2019s easy. Para pag-tanggap ng tao \u2014 I\u2019m addressing myself, under me \u2014 journal. Papirmahin mo siya. Lagyan mo doon, tingnan mo sa computer. Mag-connect ka doon sa actuarial. Hindi mo kailangan ng bobo diyan e. Matatapos siguro yan mga next month tapusin ko. Projections lang naman. 'O, balik ka dito August 15, 3 o\u2019clock.' Pagdating, ibigyan yan.,Now, if he goes to Malaca\u00f1ang, I\u2019ll open it up. For those who have valid reasons to complain about graft and corruption, the gates of Malaca\u00f1ang will be open. Doon ka. [applause] Mag-sumbong ka. At I will be briefed by my military or aide or yung si ano, itong nagbigay ng tubig. 'Sir, dito marami ka.',I have the reason why I do not go out. I do not accept invitations. Hindi ako tumatanggap because every time I travelled around Manila, it causes a huge congestion. Kasi pag itong pag-uwi ko, [inaudible] by projection. Paglabas ni presidente, ano yan, picture taking ganon. And they start to block the--- yung roads access to the...Ganon iyan. Everytime a president come out,   ganon iyan. So, paparahin nila iyan, sasabihin nila, dadaan iyan by this time. And in the meantime, sarado yan. Paglabas ko, akala mo Biyernes Santo. Walang sasakyan diyan.,Ikaw pala exponentially --- ang traffic, the tail end of the traffic is somewhere [inaudible] And it would take about two to three hours to normalize. Kaya hindi ako tumatanggap ng... And I hate to travel. Kasi talagang lilinisin eh. Ito namang\u2026 Kasi ang taas kasi ng entourage ng Presidente. Dulo sa dulo may ambulansya. Hindi lang entourage, parang [inaudible] Sabi ko: Dalawa, tatlo, tama na, sa gitna lang ako. Pero ang totoo, mag-taxi lang ako dito sa likod. Sunod lang ako. [laughter and applause] Eh takot man sila na\u2026 Ano naman ang makuha ko kung patayin mo ako?  What for... May ambulansya doon. Dagdagan mo na ng punerarya. [laughter],I have also ordered the DFA to streamline documentary requirements and passport applications and open additional Consular Offices  in strategic places to decongest Metro Manila sites [applause] and avoid queues that have caused hardships and suffering to passport applicants.,I have also directed the newly-created DICT, Information and Communication Technology,  to develop a National Broadband Plan  to accelerate the deployment of fiber optics cables and wireless technologies to improve internet speed. [applause],Ito para ito sa\u2026 Alam ko, mahal kong mga kababayan, maligayahan kayo nito. Ipag-paano mo lang yung Tagalog ko kasi...Eh kayo hindi kayo marunong mag-Bisaya eh 'di...[laughter],Wi-Fi access shall be provided at no charge in selected public places [applause] including  parks, plazas, public libraries, schools, government hospitals, train stations, airports and seaports. O \u2018di ba? [applause] Happy lahat.,All government agencies are instructed to enable their clients  to submit applications for coordination to other agencies combined. [Itaas mo, wala na yan. Ayaw ko nang mag-salita.] ,The national portal, yes, because it\u2019s our parang website. Ito: We shall intensify \u2014 mainit talaga ako dito \u2013 I place it in parity with drugs. We shall intensify our war against human traffickers and illegal recruiters that prey on our migrants. [applause],To help ensure that the hard-earned money of the Filipinos overseas are put into productive use,  a mandatory financial education for all migrants and their communities will be pursued with incentives to encourage entrepreneurship among them.,I may now also ask on Congress  to consider drawing up bills consolidating and merging agencies and offices having to do the Overseas Filipino to have a department that shall focus on and quickly respond to their problems and concerns. Kailangan ko ng isa. [applause] And I have asked\u2026 I don\u2019t know if Secretary Bello is here, Bebot. Wala? Absinero talaga yan. [laughter] Maski sa Cabinet absinero yan. Gusto ko, he will rent or we\u2019ll lease some buildings here for overseas only. At lagyan ko ng \u2013 and they will direct all BIR, lahat na. BIR, lahat ng something to do with the clearances of the police, in one building, may booth lang. I said: My God! Make use of the computer.,So doon lang siya mag-ikot sa isang building. Ang Pilipino, hindi na siya mag-punta doon sa Statistics. Hindi na siya punta doon sa ano, diyan, diyan sa opisina. Gamitin ninyo ang computer and you can get the results right after. Why do we have... Has to travel to Malate, then he will just stuck in the traffic. He can only accomplish one document at one time. ,NBI clearance is doon na ninyo ibigay. Lahat na doon na. At kung dapat, may-awa si Bello, pakainin niyo yung mga tao doon. Lalo na sa probinsya. Pagtingin ninyo taga-probinsya, finish it right away. Make use of the computer. O kapag hindi niyo ginamit yan, tapon na lang ninyo. Throw away your computers and I will understand that. It would take you years to do it.  Do the computer. [Taas mo na yan. Wala na yan.] [laughter],Ito: To help avoid squatter-like conditions in relocation sites, we urge utilities like Meralco and electric cooperatives  to exercise their social corporate responsibility by making direct connections to relocation sites and depressed areas.,Alam mo kung bakit? Kaya nga nilagyan nila diyan e. That\u2019s why I had to talk to you ganito. 'Bakit?' It\u2019s because walang kuryente pagka mahirap ka. You do not own the land. That is my experience 23 years as mayor. Hindi magbigay ng direct connection. Kasi hindi ikaw ang may-ari ng lupa but that squatter, they have been there for 20 years. ,So mag-connect-connect sila. Pag ka-connect-connect nila, ang gamitin nila yung wire na, yung pinaka-mura. So it overheats because connect-connect na lang sila kung sino yung minsan magnakaw. You know, we will have to make the adjustments. It is not for these people to make the corrections because they are not in a position to do it.,We have to adjust to the needs of our people. Total diyan naman yang sa squatter na yan, as long as I sit here as President, there will be there no demolitions without relocations. Hindi talaga ako papayag. [applause] Hindi naman aso yan na --- just like in Davao. I\u2019d like to make a dialogue with the businessmen. \u201cSir, how much are you investing in this land you have bought with the squatter?\u201d \"So, I bought it at about 60 million.\" Dagdagan mo ng 20 million. Ako na ang bahala. Sabihin ko doon sa mga tao, \"Bili tayo ng relocation site or I will provide.\" Government will expropriate. I will make use of the expropriation powers. Ako ganon sa Davao eh. I have 20 hectares there. I will expropriate some land there. Iyong malapit lang. Then sabihin ko: \"This 20 million will help your journey to a new land.\" And I will urge everybody na yung mga bagong mga factories, doon sila mag-tayo. ,Magtiis-tiis lang muna kayo. In the meantime,  you have to mitigate the hardships of these people. That\u2019s the only way to do it. Sa demolition, walang matirahan ang tao. Tutal you sat on your rights for many years eh bakit mo ngayon, pipilitin mo ako magka-problema ng ganon? Eh may iba kasi, hinahayaan nila. Ten, 20 years, they do nothing. And when the time, comes, na pagbili lang nila, tayo na disturbuhin. O \u2018di gumastos ka para mas madali. Just add a little bit more and there will be at least peace. Pag hindi, wala yan. Fight na naman \u2018yan, between government and the tawag nila, \"squatters\". Squatters naman talaga yan. Masasaktan lang mamatay for no reason at all. Eh kung mayaman ka, bigyan mo ng konting ano, provide a relocation. And I\u2019ll be glad to talk to the people and say: \u201cGo. It is not yours.\u201d,I have directed the concerned regulatory agencies to prioritize the issuance of required permits for power development. Okay \u2018yan sa akin. Ang problema sandali ito. [Para ka diyan.] Iyong mga environmentalist, meron tayong, meron tayong, ano kasi \u2013 marami ang coal. Pati yang... Ito nga, itong energy emissions, wala man akong problema diyan. But do not tell me na, if you... Ambassador ka tapos sabihin mo sa akin na, 'medyo hanggang diyan lang kayo, kasi  kami hangang dito lang kami. ' Sabi ko, 'Ano? Kayo umabot diyan. You are now in the apex of your industrial might. But along the way, you were the first \u2013 America, China, Europe.' Kayong  bomba-bomba, until now we contribute only something point zero. So, if you put so much restrictions doon sa treaty na yan, the treaty which we are trying to \u2013 it's still here in the Senate. Let us be very clear on this: We  need  to industrialize. We need the power and, therefore, the emissions would also be considered. You just can't say it: 'I established five economic zones here'. And you start to say that, 'you are spewing so much carbon footprints'. Mahirap yan. I mean, it's hard. I cannot just agree on anything that will delay. I\u2019m only good for six years.,And I intend to do something during my term. Now, I\u2019m sure that the heavy machineries would come in and even the power, cheapest is coal. So ito naman locally, you get in trouble with Gina. So, we'll just talk sa Cabinet na lang. Si Gina naman is a very fine lady. Huwag ka lang magsimangot sa harapan niya. Bigyan ka niya permit maski lima. Magsimangot ka,  zero. [laughter],Oo, just be gracious to her, that's all. It's a matter of talking and explaining to them. But if it is... You're using the state of the art technology and I\u2019ve seen it several times in the other power plants in this country. If it is really a good one, then we will consider, I said, because we need the energy to power our industrialization.[applause],To strengthen the delivery of social services, the government will intensify its protection programs, so it can use its resources, expertise to make a dent in the country\u2019s poverty levels.,What we want is genuinely to reduce the vulnerabilities of our people, build resiliency and empower individuals, and families and communities.,The beneficiaries of 4Ps shall be made to become independent and self-reliant after they have graduated from the program [applause]. But the aim is to present it with other forms of assistance, so that they can stand on their own two feet.,But now, I have decided to direct the DSWD to provide the rice subsidies to the poorest of the families, at least, para makakain lang every month. [applause],Iyong sako na ano...,We are planning to increase spending on basic education and incorporate mandatory education about the evils of drugs.,We will also intensify and expand Alternative Learning System programs. The government will also provide universal health insurance for all Filipinos [applause]. Benefits \u2013 Sali na lang natin sa PhilHealth.,The professional competence and operational capabilities of government hospitals and health facilities will be strengthened.,Consistent with our international obligations, in keeping with national mandates, this administration vows to protect women\u2019s rights and human rights abuses [applause] against our women, because this unacceptable to... Kung mag-bugbog ka ng babae.,Thus, I order all agencies and oversight bodies and local government units down to the barangay level to fully implement the Magna Carta for Women. [applause] By doing so, we'll ensure that man and woman will be partners in the pursuit of country\u2019s economic, social, and cultural and political developments.,To our Lumad brothers, and they are here outside. Outside? They are here outside I\u2019m sure . I told the... Just to let them come if they want. Kanila man ito. ,To our brothers, I have this to say: The government has issued you the Ancestral Certificates Domain Title covering vast tracts of land especially in the Island of Mindanao. You have the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights Act, and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples to protect you and to assist you.,Government has given you the tool, the legal tool to improve yourself financially, economically and socially. Make use of your ancestral domain. Do not let it remain idle.,While the government is always ready to help you, you must first help yourself. We cannot legislate financial and economic progress for you. It is you and you alone who can do that. You can chart your fate, but do it  within constitutional and legal means.,After being devastated by natural and man-made calamities these past few years, we are still to recover emotionally from the loss of our loved ones, and materially from the loss of our homes and our income sources.,There are many among us whose emotional wounds are still fresh and painful to the touch. We cannot erase the images of death and destruction from our minds.  We cannot wash away the stench of rotting flesh from our noses. And there are many of us who are still waiting for the help that was promised. The enormity of the problem of drug addiction has been made manifest by the number of surrenderees which grows by the hundred each day that passes. Since July 1, we have already made 3,600 related drug arrests. 120,[000] drug dependents have already surrendered and 70,000 of them are pushers. You think this is just a... [applause] It could take the entire resources of this government to fight this war.,I have nothing but the interest of my country. But let\u2019s wait because the PDEA says that \u2013 it's about the past statement made by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. ,Two years ago, PDEA came out with a statement that there are 3 million drug addicts in this country.

Any citizen can bring a case to the Supreme Court (SC) questioning the factual basis of martial law.,In the Saturday speech, Duterte repeated his, criticism, of these safeguards, asking what would happen if Congress and the SC have differing positions on the martial law declaration. Duterte would then have to take a side.,\"Here is Congress and here is the Supreme Court drawn into a stalemate just to have the safety nets of an abusive despot or dictator. Where will I go then? So if the Supreme Court decides otherwise and here is Congress, what will I do now? There is no more control.

{"content": "\nOver 4 months since Typhoon Yolanda, President Benigno Aquino III keeps taking a swipe at local authorities in Tacloban, details their failures    ,BLAME GAME. President Benigno Aquino III points to the local government unit of Tacloban's lack of preparation and coordination as the reason for the city's damage and slow relief. Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau, ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 For the first time, President Benigno Aquino III talks at length about his disappointment over Tacloban's lack of preparation and mishandling of ,Super Typhoon Yolanda (international name Haiyan),, sharing incidents and details when the local government unit (LGU) failed to come through., ,On Thursday, March 13, at a forum with high school students over 4 months since the world's biggest typhoon, Aquino said he felt the public was \"fed wrong information\" and said he wanted to share facts to \"let you decide who was prepared and wasn't prepared, and who is doing something and who is not doing something.\", ,Aquino started by comparing the huge death toll in Tacloban compared to the other areas affected by the storm., ,\"Everybody was reporting very minimal casualties. And up to the conclusion, very, very few. But in this particular portion of the country, when you look at it on the map\u2026something very different happened here. For instance, in Guian, the mayor was telling me that they attended to the warnings. They brought their people up to a hill and they braved the rains rather than storm surges that affected Guian. And again the casualties relatively were 99 people out of 45,000,\" he said., ,He also detailed how Tacloban did not follow through with the instructions he gave them, when he visited the area two days after the storm hit., ,To address looting immediately after the typhoon, Aquino said he, Philippine National Police Chief Alan Purisima, and Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin sat down with Tacloban's vice mayor and come up with an ordinance imposing a curfew. Aquino said he came back a week later but there was no ordinance., ,\"And I asked: 'What happened?' And then their explanation is in the city council only two members were present. He said they couldn't convene the city council. They couldn't have a quorum, therefore, they couldn't come up with the ordinance,\" Aquino said., ,He said in the same meeting, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) said it was ready with materials for bunkhouses and were ready to start building. He said the local government told him they had 34 hectares that could be used., ,When he returned a week later, he said he was told \"not a single house has been built and none of the bunkhouses.\", ,\"So I had to ask again: 'What happened to the bunkhouses?' It was the city administrator who said: 'We have other purposes for that land.' I said: 'What about the people who need a shelter right now?'\" Aquino said., ,LGU's failures, ,On November 8, Yolanda hit Eastern Visayas, leaving about 6,200 people dead and nearly 2,000 others missing. It also destroyed or severely damaged 1.1 million houses, leaving more than 4 million people homeless. , ,Immediately after the typhoon, the ,government was criticized, for what observers said was slow relief efforts, saying it was unclear who was in charge., ,But Aquino explained it was not the national government's fault although it got most of the blame., ,He cited the 290 policemen deployed to Tacloban City to re-establish peace and order. He said it was Tacloban that was meant to lead operations there, but even if the city was under red alert status, only 20 showed up when he visited. He said all those policemen are currently being investigated., ,Aquino said the same happened with city hall employees., ,\"The people in city hall, how many were they? It took what? Two weeks, 3 weeks or so before people started moving?\" he said., ,The President said even in clearing the streets, the local government drafted a document outlining their responsibilities and the national government's., ,\"I told them, 'Please commit to what you can do, and things that have to be done that you cannot do, we will take care of.' The document they drafted said they would take care of relief distribution. Provision and packing relief was us, they would just distribute,\" he said., ,He added that clearing of the roads, cadaver recovery, \"practically the whole list' was the national government's responsibility and that the only thing the LGU had to do was distribution of relief., ,\"Sad to say that also wasn't done properly. And at the end of the day, we were the ones blamed. The relief didn't reach victims, but they asked for it,\" Aquino said., ,He also disclosed that the national government agreed to the draft prepared by the LGU but \"at the end of the day\u2026they refused to sign the draft that they made.\", ,\"And that is a fact and I won't disparage anybody but that is the truth,\" he said., ,Concern over tents, ,Aquino revealed he is still \"bothered and concerned\" over Tacloban until now. He said victims living in tents are \"in an even more vulnerable situation come the next typhoon season.\", ,\"We have to accelerate the program where they are put in better conditions, meaning, more resistant and farther from the bay,\" he said., ,Aquino said his administration has been able to establish 53 bunkhouses in Tacloban already, housing 960 families, with 100 houses ready to be built as soon as the land is provided. He also said the national government would foot the water and electricity bills., ,\"We are told that there is hesitancy by the distribution utility to afford this electricity to the Tacloban City government,\" he said., ,He said he is especially concerned with the typhoon season fast approaching, since it takes time to build bunkhouses. \"We are hoping that we will get better cooperation from them.\", ,Hitting Romualdez, ,While Aquino said he has not responded to the charges or thrown accusations toward the LGU, the President could not help but take a swipe at Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez., ,He cited Romualdez's own lack of preparation as a sign of Tacloban's unpreparedness, and questioned his priorities, although he did not mention Romualdez's name., ,\"I was in Tanauan recently in Leyte, the mayor is not part of my party but he and the national government have been working very, very well. There is a school that took about a month to repair and rehabilitate and start being utilized by the students. Anybody was ready to partner with us. That's human nature. We can do more if everyone is willing to cooperate,\" he said., ,\"Now if you're more interested in press conferences, interviews, appearing before hearings, et cetera, we (the national government) still have a conscience that we have a responsibility to our people. And that responsibility has to go first, over us debating because that won't feed anyone or house anyone or dress anyone,\" he added.  (,READ: Aquino on Romualdez: Too many interviews, no real action,), ,\"Now, I don't think I have time to debate with him, to make this a political issue. There are people \u2013 and they keep emphasizing this to the Cabinet and other government agencies \u2013 who are continuing to suffer and our focus has to be alleviating that suffering not tomorrow, preferably yesterday. And that is where our focus is.\", ,When Aquino first visited Tacloban, ,he and Romualdez traded barbs, after Aquino expressed his disappointment over the LGU's lack of preparation. , ,A month later, in December, a video recording of Romauldez's meeting with Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II, was uploaded online a day after Romualdez told a congressional committee that the national government refused to help the city. In the clip, Roxas tells Romualdez: \"You are a Romualdez, the President is an Aquino.\", ,Roxas called the video misleading and malicious,, and accused the Romualdez camp of releasing the edited version of the video to cover up the mayor's own shortcomings., ,'I apologize', ,While Aquino did not hesitate to blame the local government, he also admitted the national government's faults and its over reliance on the LGU \"to provide the backbone.\", ,\"They will tell us who is in need, where, what is needed and ,di ba parang, even just knowing who the people we will have to work with. That was not existent Sunday, Saturday [after the storm],\" he said., ,He also apologized for what others viewed as slow relief efforts., ,\"I apologize if we couldn't act even faster. But the givens that we have had in various instances \u2013 Pablo, for instance \u2013 were not present when it hit the region. Which tells us also that with anything else, we are also students, we want to learn from this experience and do even better next time,\" he said., ,But he also insisted the national government did all it could to alleviate the situation, which was simply too overwhelming., ,\"Our people were there beforehand. We made mistakes in terms of being able to call on the indigenous government entities on the onset, but we cleared the runway that it was operational as early as 9 am of Saturday, Yolanda hit Friday. Again, [there's just] the sheer mass of people that had to be attended to,\" he said. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, , , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/typhoon-yolanda/52945-aquino-yolanda-delays-fault-tacloban-lgu", "title": "Aquino: Yolanda delays the fault of Tacloban city gov't", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/133877-two-pronged-ofw-husband-wife,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/typhoon-yolanda,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/typhoon-yolanda/43544-global-media-coverage-haiyan-philippines"},

Child pornography is a global problem; a lucrative trade fueled by lust, ignorance, and the Internet.,The Philippines is among the top 10 sources of child pornography across the world, Alex Ramos, computer forensics analyst from the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Angel Net Foundation, stressed during the 3,rd, annual Family Conference organized by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) on Wednesday, September 24.,The theme for this year\u2019s conference is celebrating the Filipino family\u2019s resilience in the face of current social ills such as \u201ccyberporn.\u201d In 2010, the Philippines ranked 4,th, globally.,\u201cChild porn is easier to do now because smart phones, computers, and the Internet are cheaper and more accessible,\u201d Ramos added.,Metro Manila, Cebu, Cagayan De Oro, and Pampanga are the primary sources of the country\u2019s online child pornography, recent data revealed.,Poverty, porn,The PNP found that street children are the most common victims of online child pornography.,\u201cMajority of cases we encounter are in depressed areas, but poverty is never an excuse to abuse children,\u201d Ramos said.,Some of these children run away from home because they feel unloved by their own families, observed Evelyn Valencia, a social worker from Bantay Bata. The child then seeks attention from others; unfortunately, some of them end up being taken advantage of.,Children who go online unsupervised may also fall prey to sexual predators.,\u201cThe suspect befriends children on Facebook or chat rooms. Some are tricked into sending photos, lured by promises of money, gadgets, or a modeling career,\u201d Ramos said.,After sending one photo, children are blackmailed by perpetrators into sending more explicit pictures.,\u201cThe children fear their photos being leaked, so they give in to the perpetrator\u2019s demands,\u201d he explained.,Pushed by parents,The worst case, however, is when the children are pushed by their own parents to engage in pornography.

He added the Philippines has enough laws against child pornography and abuse, but many Filipinos remain unaware.,The ,Anti-Child Pornography Act, of 2009 or Republic Act 9775 protects children from any form of exploitation and abuse, penalizing violators accordingly.,Other relevant laws include the following:,More support should also be given to survivors through partnerships between the government and non-governmental organizations, according to Ramos.,\u201cThere\u2019s an explicit photo of a 4-year-old that circulated online.

(WATCH: ,MRT North Avenue station: Get Lucky by Daft Punk,),One can tell how a country\u2019s rulers treat its people just by looking at the mass transport systems they build for them.,Our elites\u2019 lack of compassion, let alone respect, shows in those ridiculously narrow passages under the Guadalupe, Ortigas, or Kamuning stations that force hundreds of people to walk sideways just inches away from rampaging buses; in all the escalators and elevators that rarely ever work, endangering the pregnant, and shutting out the handicapped and the elderly; in the severely-cramped coaches that expose women to sexual harassment every day.,Their disdain reveals itself in all the ways by which they have made commuting to work a daily struggle for basic dignity.,Perhaps nothing more clearly exemplifies their cold indifference and crass opportunism than the kind of connection they built between the Cubao MRT and LRT stations\u2014or that they have so far still failed to build between the Roosevelt LRT station and the North EDSA MRT station: Instead of connecting these stations so as to minimize walking, they have instead forced tens of thousands of connecting passengers with no other choice but to march like a captive herd through Gateway or SM North and Trinoma.,A daily Calvary for workers, but a wonderful bonanza for the mall-owners.,All this forces us to ask: Is this really just \u201cinsensitivity\u201d? Doesn\u2019t forcing people\u2014already exhausted from being jolted out of bed early, working all day, and jostling for space inside the MRT\u2014to walk another unnecessary kilometer cause unnecessary pain? Isn\u2019t being exposed to the scorching sun for over an hour in Manila\u2019s heat and humidity a form of cruel and unusual punishment? Doesn\u2019t all the stress and anguish from having to go through this life-draining ordeal daily constitute a form of avoidable suffering?,In short: doesn\u2019t all this constitute mass violence\u2014violence so routinized we don\u2019t even think of it as violence?,Subsidizing our chaufferred classes,Some might say these are all just \u201cengineering\u201d or \u201cmanagement\u201d issues that couldn\u2019t be blamed on our ruling classes as a whole. But if our ruling elites can\u2019t even be bothered with such issues\u2014if they can\u2019t find the time to review the blueprints and check whether our lolas won\u2019t be trampled on in platform, whether our kids won\u2019t be run over by buses\u2014then what does that say about what they think of us?,Having largely monopolized power over our resources and how to spend them, our chauffeured classes can\u2019t escape collective responsibility because decisions involving public transport\u2014from how much to spend for trains vis-\u00e0-vis skyways to where to put stations or how wide walkways should be\u2014require not only the approval of government officials and their private contractors, but also the tacit backing all other elites who could potentially object to them. ,And to date, there seems no indication whatsoever that our otherwise fractious elites\u2014normally split on so many other issues\u2014are bitterly divided over the over-funding of projects that disproportionately favor them. Nor do they\u2014or the parties, NGOs, and intellectuals they patronize\u2014seem particularly troubled by the massive under-funding of public transport. ,And why should they? Public transport is actually an indispensable but overlooked part of the production process (since without getting workers to their factories/offices there would be no goods/services and therefore no profits), and the more that its financial, psychological and other costs are borne by our commuting classes, the more that our elites are effectively being subsidized by them. ,Remember that every peso that capitalists don\u2019t spend on getting their workers to their factories because they could rely on the MRT is an additional peso they could take home as profits.,Besides, since they don\u2019t pay workers for every additional hour they spend going to work anyway\u2014even if, from the point of view of the worker, each additional hour spent on commuting is in fact an unpaid part of their total working day\u2014capitalists couldn\u2019t care less about whether workers spend one, two, or five hours traveling to/from the factory for so long as said workers show up and render the total number of hours of work they are paid for in wages. ,Consider that every hour that workers can\u2019t spend for themselves or their children because they are stuck in line for the MRT is an additional hour that is effectively spent \u201cworking\u201d since getting to work is arguably just as much a part of working as being at work.,Few of our chauffeurred classes understand all this, however, because\u2014cosseted in their heavily-armed mini-Republics of Forbes, Wack-Wack, Serendra, etc.\u2014many if not most of them mostly see the MRT not as an integral part of their world but as a foreign country: an exotic place where they can pose for \u201cselfies\u201d like tourists, with members of an exotic tribe smiling in the background.,INEFFICIENT, MISMANAGED. The Riles Network wants MRT 3 general manager Al Vitangcol to resign for failing to ease and prevent long lines at MRT 3 stations. File photo by Leanne Jazul/Rappler,Building collective power out of diffuse anger,But if our elites seem not to care, it is not because they are genetically incapable of empathy. It is only because they are forced\u2014by market or electoral competition in a patronage-driven capitalist society\u2014to care about other things: the maximization of their profits, rents, or tongpats. ,And they have managed to get away with caring more for these other things only because\u2014so far at least\u2014no countervailing group has forced them to change their priorities.,After all, the livability of cities has rarely ever been granted as a gift by a country\u2019s \u201cenlightened\u201d elites. If the metro system and urban infrastructure of Paris, London, San Francisco, and other cities are more humane today, for example, it is only because their commuting classes organized and fought for them against the bitter opposition of their own chaufferred classes.,Angry at their terrible living conditions and the unresponsiveness of their elites, they engaged in concerted civil disobedience, campaigns, strikes, protests, and other forms of direct action as part of broader collective struggles to improve their well-being. Though initially diffuse, their scattered anger and inchoate aspirations were fused typically by labor groups and socialist parties into a broader social movement that ultimately won them not only more humane subways, but even the right to vote and the right to take two days off at the end of the working week. ,And they won, at least in part, because their own chaufferred classes were spooked by the memory of what the hungry French did to their callous aristocracy in 1789.,The lessons of Marie Antoinette,One can tell how scared a country\u2019s rulers are of its people just by looking at the quality of the trains they build for them. For it is here, in such mundane things as the architecture of our public infrastructure, that the balance of forces among different social groups of a society are recorded and cemented.,Today, the sorry state of our public transport system reflects the fact that, given the present balance of forces, our chauffeurred classes can still act with such callousness and get away with it.,Such a system won\u2019t be fixed unless our chaufferred classes are compelled to care, and they will not be compelled to care unless all this pent-up rage now welling up inside every grim-faced commuter forced to suffer quietly and in isolation in the MRT every day is gathered together and formed into a new social force: a broad social movement capable of advancing a concrete alternative project for a different kind of public transport system, a different kind of city, a different kind of development. ,For now, much of the anger that could fuel such a movement remains diffuse and easily dissipated precisely because it is dispersed. ,But, as indicated by how people responded to the government\u2019s Marie-Antoinette-like provocation, even that may already be changing. Heeding the government\u2019s injunctions, many netizens promptly \u201cdiscovered other options\u201d for moving around the city apart from through the MRT. Their \u201cdiscoveries\u201d? Batmobiles, Star Trek transporters, magic carpets\u2014or flying \u201con the wings of love\u2026\u201d ,Perhaps that\u2019s also how the French started out in the 1780s: by laughing at their collective misery and mocking their exploitative aristocrats. But, as we know from what happened to Marie Antoinette and the aristocracy, the French didn\u2019t stop at joking around. - ,Rappler.com,Herbert Docena is a PhD candidate in Sociology who sometimes carjacks his father\u2019s sedan but would really rather take the train., ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/55402-mrt-violence-of-mass-transport-system", "title": "MRT and the violence of our mass transport system", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/139638-encantadia-2016-cast-photos-grand-press-con,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/nation/55255-palace-apologizes-for-poor-mrt-service,http://www.rappler.com/video/webhits/51041-webhits-mrt-north-ave-station-get-lucky-by-daft-punk"},

{"content": "\nInternational media\u2019s extensive coverage of Haiyan shows the magnitude of the destruction and prompts the influx of aid    ,EXTENSIVE COVERAGE. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper reports on Haiyan live from an airport in Manila and tosses to Anna Coren on the latest relief efforts in Cebu. Screengrab from CNN ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s as if CNN turned into a local channel.\u201d  ,Social media-savvy Filipinos could not help but comment on the international news channel\u2019s wall-to-wall coverage of the ,devastation Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) wrought on central Philippines,.,The world\u2019s biggest typhoon, easily became one of the biggest stories of the year, with top global journalists and media organizations showing audiences from all over the globe heart-wrenching images of a disaster whose magnitude was unprecedented in Philippine history.,On the fifth day after the disaster, CNN's Anderson Cooper called out the Philippine government for the slow relief effort, saying it was unclear who is in charge. He described the condition in Tacloban City as a \"miserable, miserable situation.\" Tacloban is among the areas that bore the brunt of the typhoon. ,\u201cIt is a very desperate situation, among the most desperate I\u2019ve seen in covering disasters over the last couple of years,\" Cooper said while reporting live from Tacloban on Wednesday, November 13.  ,\u201cYou would expect perhaps to see a feeding center that had been set up 5 days after the storm. We haven\u2019t seen that, certainly not in this area. Some food is being brought to people here at the airport, some water being distributed but these are very, very difficult conditions for the people here on the ground and it\u2019s not clear how much longer it can continue like this. Something\u2019s got to give.\",In 2005, ,Cooper also took US officials to task, over the response to Hurricane Katrina. This time, he said Filipino victims are desperate. ,Cooper added, \"Certainly, US military personnel are here on the ground. There\u2019s a group of marines here, they\u2019ve set up operation. They\u2019ve checked out the airport. That is underway and that cannot come soon enough. But as for who exactly is in charge of the Philippine side of this operation, that is not really clear. I\u2019m just surprised. I expected on this day 5, I thought I\u2019ve maybe gotten here very late, that things would be well in hand. It does not seem like that.\" ,A journalist who has covered major disasters and conflicts, Cooper compared the Philippines' response to Haiyan to that of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.,\u201cWhen I was in Japan, right after the tsunami there two years ago, within a day or two, you had Japanese defense forces going out, carving up cities into grids and going out on foot looking for people, walking through the wreckage. We have not seen that here in any kind of large-scale operation.\u201d ,Cooper is just one of CNN\u2019s anchors and reporters on the ground. Andrew Stevens got to Tacloban before Haiyan made landfall, with Paula Hancocks following suit. In Cebu are Anna Coren and Ivan Watson. Kristie Lu Stout anchors from Manila.,From breaking news to people stories, weather forecasts, scientific analysis to Twitter trends, international news agencies\u2019 extensive coverage of Haiyan showed the extent of the destruction and prompted the influx of foreign aid.,UN humanitarian chief Valeria Amos said in a press briefing, \"We have already seen an international and generous response given the horrific pictures that people have seen, particularly on their television screens.\" ,Screenshot of The New York Times US Edition's November 12, 2013 homepage ,Tsunami, Katrina, climate change,Besides CNN, BBC and Al Jazeera, even American networks like ,NBC, ABC, and CBS deployed correspondents, to report on the aftermath of Haiyan.,Those who could not send reporters contacted local news groups. For example, Rappler got requests for reports, video and fixers from 10 news organizations from areas as diverse as the US, UK, Israel, France, Germany, Singapore, Canada, and the Netherlands.,\u201c,Death, fear and humanity at typhoon\u2019s ground zero,\u201d went the November 12 headline of ,The Guardian. ,The typhoon was also the banner story of the US and international editions of ,The New York Times ,and CNN,, ,washingtonpost.com, BBC, and even a newspaper in Finland.,November 12, 2013 frontpage of UK's The Guardian ,Screenshot of The Washington Post November 12, 2013 homepage,Screenshot of the November 12, 2013 home page of Helsingin Sanomat, a newspaper in Finland ,This is not the first time the Philippines made global headlines. Events like the 1986 People Power Revolution, EDSA 2 in 2001, and more recently, the 2009 Maguindanao massacre made the Philippines the top story in world news.,This time though, the focus is on a climate event that occurred as the, United Nations meets in Warsaw, Poland, to discuss actions needed to fight climate change. Philippine negotiator Yeb Sa\u00f1o ,made an impassioned appeal, for developing countries like the Philippines bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. ,Foreign correspondents often compare Haiyan to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed over 200,000 people in 13 countries.,Hancocks said,, \u201cThe sheer devastation and debris is something I have seen from tsunamis \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen damage of this magnitude from a typhoon before\u2026.This country sees more than 20 typhoons each year but not at the level or scale brought on by this storm.\u201d, ,International journalists also use Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy as a point of reference.,A, ,Los Angeles Times ,story, reported, \u201cEven Hurricane Katrina, the modern measure of nature\u2019s disastrous force on the United States, pales when compared to the punch and expected devastation from Typhoon Haiyan.\u201d,BBC\u2019s science editor used a ,virtual reality studio, to explain the forces that made the typhoon severe, while CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos constantly tweeted about Haiyan\u2019s path, and before-and-after photos of hard-hit areas.,The global reports also depicted the level of response by a government faced with calamities of this proportion.,With the backdrop of a wounded man being boarded on a military chopper in Northern Cebu, Coren reported, \u201cThey need food and water. Despite assurances from the government, aid has yet to arrive. The problem is logistics.\u201d,Personal experience, emotional reporting,Glocal coverage is not limited to big picture reporting and analysis. Like local reporters, foreign journalists reported their experience at the height of the typhoon as they became rescuers or victims.,Stevens did a package, about his hotel in Tacloban getting inundated and a family trapped in one of the rooms. \u201cIt was time to stop documenting the storm and get into rescue mode,\u201d he said. Video by ,storm chaser James Reynolds, showed the anchor and his crew helping a family get on a foam mattress and wading them to safety.,Al Jazeera\u2019s Jamela Alindogan did a phone report narrating her ,two-hour ordeal, of almost having to jump to floodwaters from her hotel in Leyte. \u201cEverything else that we had had been swept away. We had nothing left except the clothes on our back. The camera was completely broken.\u201d,International correspondents though have shifted the focus back to victims who lost lives, family, and homes. They noted that the typhoon hit one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. ,Hancocks interviewed a tearful couple, whose 3 daughters were swept away from their arms. Two died and one was missing. \u201cI hope she\u2019s alive,\u201d said the father.,Agence France-Presse\u2019s Jason Gutierrez told ,one of the most compelling stories, of life in Tacloban after Haiyan. He talked to Edward Gualberto, who raided a home with the owner\u2019s bodies still inside.,\"I am a decent person. But if you have not eaten in 3 days, you do shameful things to survive,\" Gualberto said.,Filipino netizens expressed gratitude for the focus on their country, hoping all this attention will lead to desperately needed aid and information, and avoid a repeat of the horrific images they had seen on screen. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,What are your thoughts on media coverage of Haiyan?

Fidel Agcaoili is the newly appointed chief negotiator of the communist National Democratic Front of the Philippines. Rappler photo ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The 5-month-old ceasefire between the Philippine military and the New People's Army (NPA) is in danger of collapse as communist rebels protest delays in the release of over 400 political prisoners and alleged military advances in areas they claim to occupy.,Fidel Agcaoili, chief negotiator of the communist National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF), said the 3rd round of talks to be held in Rome  from January 18 to 25 will be \"critical.\",The government has previously committed to address the two sore points affecting the talks.,\",Malaki. Malaki ang, danger ,na mabe-,break, 'yan kasi nga hindi mo mapipigilan ,(There is a big danger that will break [the ceasefire] because it can't be helped anymore),\" Agcaoili said in a no-holds-barred interview on Rappler Talk. (WATCH: ,Rappler Talk: Fragile talks with the Philippine left,),If the issues are not addressed, Agcaoili is  looking at a scenario where there still will be negotiations as fighting resumes on the ground. \"Talk while fighting. That could really happen,\" Agcaoili said, citing similar arrangements during past administrations.,In a separate interview on Thursday, January 12, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the chance of the ceasefire holding is \"50-50.\" ,While the military supports the peace process and hopes to sign a joint ceasefire deal, Lorenzana said the military is ready to go back to war if the negotiation fails due to what he referred to as difficult demands coming from the communist rebels. He did not elaborate.,\"It's 50-50. ,Kasi marami silang hinihingi na ayaw ibigay ni presidente ,(They have difficult demands that the president is not willing to give),\" Lorenzana told Rappler. ,'Talk while fighting',A broken ceasefire should not stop the talks, he said. ,\"We can continue talking whether there is a ceasefire or there is no ceasefire. We challenge him. ,Kung walang, (If there is no) ceasefire, ,hindi ba puwedeng mag-usap ,(can't we talk),?

The government committed to recommend the amnesty of political prisoners  while the NDF agreed to sign a bilateral ceasefire agreement that will guarantee a prolonged ceasefire. ,The process of granting amnesty to political prisoners is taking time, however, because it requires Congress approval. No new timeline was set for the signing of a bilateral ceasefire deal \u2013 one that will put in place common rules for the military and the NPA to follow to avoid misencounters on the ground \u2013 that they originally wanted to be in place by October 2016. ,In August, the government released 22 detained NDF consultants to join the talks, including tagged high-ranking leaders of the New People's Army. Among them was ,Benito Tiamzon,, who was appointed as the newest member of the NDF negotiating panel. In December, 4 convicted NPA rebels were granted ,pardon,.,The government is working out the release of over 100 more political prisoners, but President Rodrigo Duterte said he will only allow it if the NDF signs a bilateral ceasefire agreement that is meant to guarantee the continuation of the ceasefire. (READ: ,Duterte sets condition for freeing 130 political prisoners,),Ceasefire violations,The communist rebels are accusing the military of taking advantage of the ceasefire by conducting military operations in areas the rebels claim to occupy. The military denied this and some officers, who refused to be quoted because they are not authorized to speak on the matter, are accusing the NPA of the same violations. ,Agcaoili said the NPA combatants are avoiding the military to protect the ceasefire but the situation is becoming \"untenable\" because  troops, he said, are occupying schools, day care centers, public plazas, and even bus stops.,For 2017, the military announced a new campaign plan \u2013 Development Support and Security Plan (DSSP) Kapayapaan or DSSP Kapayapaan \u2013 that adjusts its military operations to support the peace initiatives under the Duterte administration.

It is not a joke for everybody,\" he said.,Coordination with the MILF,While he deplores desecration of the bodies, Duterte believed that the operation and entry of the government security forces should not have been made without coordination with the MILF.,The conduct was an anomaly in itself, he said.,He cited the government's signed formal agreement with the MILF, explaining that the agreement outlines areas where security forces of both parties are barred from entering.,\"What is clear is that we intruded into a territory that is not allowed for us, government security forces. It is not a treaty but a formal agreement which is part of the peace process,\" said Duterte, who is also a lawyer.,Even if the policemen were carrying out an order from the court, he said the one who ordered the operation should have considered the \"existing realities\" on the ground.,Opposite opinion,While Duterte is pushing to halt the passage of the Bangsamoro law, Cebu Governor Hilario Davide III said in a separate interview that the Mamasapano incident should not stall the peace process in Mindanao.,A staunch ally of Aquino, the governor said the direction should still be toward a lasting peace and order in Mindanao.,\"The peace process should proceed, although most reactions are against it,\" said Governor Davide. \"I am against all-out war.

(Is that an issue?) I\u2019m not aware of that.\u201d,Vice President Jejomar Binay scoffed at Senator Aquilino \u201cKoko\u201d Pimentel III\u2019s request for him to formalize his resignation from his party of 3 decades through a letter.,Binay commented on Pimentel\u2019s request after announcing that he is ,leaving the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban), through the media without informing Pimentel. Binay was the party\u2019s chairman while Pimentel is PDP-Laban president. Binay said he is forming his own party instead.,The Vice President said he was not aware Pimentel was asking him for a formal resignation.,\u201c,Ang tanong ko naman: ,issue, ba iyon,? Is that a condition precedent? ,Okay lang., He\u2019s entitled to his opinion,\u201d Binay said in an interview at his Pag-IBIG Fund office in Makati on Monday, March 3. (My question is: is that an issue?),Binay also dismissed Pimentel\u2019s statement that after he bolted PDP-Laban, the party will now leave the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), which Binay founded with former President Joseph Estrada of the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (PMP) for the 2013 polls.,\u201cThat will be their decision because we are not members of PDP. Because that is one of the things that triggered this. We, PDP-Laban, were part of setting up UNA so as a party, we were bound [to the alliance]. But then they did not follow it. So if the leadership of PDP decides to leave, that\u2019s their decision. Our [new] party will likely join the coalition,\u201d Binay said.,Binay\u2019s words harked back to his rift with Pimentel in 2013. Back then, Pimentel was a founding leader of UNA but decided to ,leave the alliance, after Binay and Estrada ,accepted his fierce political rival,, resigned Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri. Pimentel ran under the administration ticket Team PNoy.,The senator took exception to Zubiri\u2019s inclusion in the slate despite his strong objection while Binay argued that Pimentel did not honor the agreement to respect the nominees of PMP.,Pimentel filed an electoral sabotage case against Zubiri over the 2007 polls and accused him of depriving him of 4 out of 6 years of his Senate term. Zubiri belatedly resigned in 2011 amid mounting evidence of fraud.,Over the weekend, Binay also said that cracks in the party started even in the 2010 polls. Binay\u2019s spokesman, Joey Salgado, told Rappler that the vice president was referring to the decision of Pimentel\u2019s sister, Gwendolyn, to run for senator under the Nacionalista Party (NP) in 2010 instead of the Estrada-Binay ticket.,\u2018Binay: My party one of principles\u2019,Binay said he decided to form a new party to clarify the confusion surrounding his political affiliation.,\u201cBecause many people were asking me to join our party but it would be so unfair for me to say \u2018Yes, join us\u2019 and then leave the party they are joining,\u201d he said.,Asked what will make his yet-to-be-named party unique, Binay said, \u201cHopefully, the big difference people see is this is not a party of personalities. This will be a party of principles.\u201d,The Vice President said that aside from the incumbent UNA officials, a likely addition to his new party is the President\u2019s uncle, former Tarlac Rep Jose \u201cPeping\u201d Cojuangco Jr, who was also part of UNA and PDP-Laban.,\u201c[He] might [join] because there are also disgruntled Laban members. Historically, PDP and Laban were separate parties. PDP at that time was led by Senator Nene Pimentel while we were with Senator [Bobby] Ta\u00f1ada, and Ninoy Aquino in Laban. The two parties decided to merge. The way things are going now, those belonging to Laban are no longer happy,\u201d Binay said.,Besides partnering with PMP under UNA, Binay said it is possible his new party will also coalesce with more parties.,\u201cWe would not know. Maybe other parties want to join our coalition. After all, the coalition was accredited by Comelec in the 2013 elections. If the others want to join, then the coalition will decide,\u201d he said.,Binay said the new party is still in its early stages, lacking a mission-vision and other \u201cfinishing touches.\u201d He plans to launch the party on June 12, Independence Day.,HAPPIER TIMES. Joey de Venecia, Senator Koko Pimentel, Vice President Jejomar Binay and former Senator Nene Pimentel were together during the 30th anniversary celebration of PDP-Laban two years ago. File photo ,Nene Pimentel: No need for Binay to inform me,Pimentel said Binay\u2019s decision to leave PDP-Laban will not affect the party because the vice president was \u201cnot active\u201d lately.,The exchange of words is the latest sign of the deterioration of ties between the two political families. The Binays and Pimentels have been ,together in PDP-Laban for about 30 years,. (READ: ,Binay-Pimentel: The ties that bind,),Binay and former Senator Aquilino \u201cNene\u201d Pimentel Jr were the top leaders of PDP-Laban during the Marcos years until Pimentel retired in 2010 and passed on the party leadership to his son. In previous interviews, the younger Pimentel referred to Binay as his mentor.,Yet Zubiri\u2019s inclusion in UNA in 2013 changed the relationship.,Former Senator Pimentel took graciously Binay\u2019s decision leave the party they forged through the years. ,Asked if Binay talked to him about leaving, Nene Pimentel told Rappler, \u201cNo, he has not and he doesn\u2019t have to.

{"content": "\nOne year since the bloody siege of Zamboanga City, Rappler sits down with soldiers of the Light Reaction Battalion who have stories to tell and lessons to share \n,NUEVA ECIJA, Philippines \u2013 For several days government troops waited as negotiators exhausted means to end the Zamboanga siege peacefully. By the time the soldiers were ordered to mount a counter-attack, however, they were already faced with a complex combat zone where rebels had taken hostages and entrenched themselves in key defensive positions.,Soldiers by the codename \"Venom,\" \"Dark Knight,\" \"Karambit,\" and \"Wild Orchid\" remember everything that transpired in Zamboanga City from September 9 to 28, 2013 \u2013 the action, the suspense, the drama and even the comedy that came with it.,On September 9, 2013, close to 500 members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) ,attacked the city, to protest what they considered was government's failure to fulfill the provisions of the peace agreement that the MNLF signed with the Ramos administration in 1996.,Government troops fought back in what would turn out to be the Philippine military's biggest operation in recent history. What followed was a fierce battle that stretched for 3 weeks, killed 19 government forces and 208 rebels, and dislocated 24,000 families. (READ: ,Zamboanga siege: Ground zero a year after,),A year after the siege, Rappler sat down with the elite troops from the Philippine military's anti-terrorist Light Reaction Battalion (LRB) at their headquarters in Nueva Ecija, where they recalled the siege that tested their wit and mettle.,Created in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, the LRB was trained for situations such as the Zamboanga siege. It's a Tier 1 unit, whose, members were plucked from the elite Scout Rangers and the Special Forces. They were trained to either become an assaulter or a sniper \u2013 skills necessary in urban combat, hostage rescue, and neutralization of high value targets,Target: KGK,The first challenge for the LRB was the KGK  Building a,long Lustre street, a 4-story structure with very thick walls that MNLF commander ,Habier Malik, and his followers had turned into a well-fortified base. It would become the most important target for government troops.,MNLF Commander Habier Malik. ,Trained for surgical operations, the LRB troops planned to attack the KGK building. But there was a hitch: they didn't have the floor plan and they lacked enough information on rebel strength and position.,\",Wala kaming, floor plan. ,Pero sabi ng tropa,: Sir, ,kailangan kunin na natin ito ,(We didn't have a floor pan. But the troops said: Sir, we should take this already),\" recalled LRB commander Colonel Teodoro Llamas. ,They found a short route from the back of a hospital compound. The plan was to approach the wall of KGK, bore a hole in the wall, force their way in, surprise the rebels and free the hostages.,It was easier said than done. The plan exposed them to an open terrain and a swampy area. They had to crawl under the cover of darkness, relying on government snipers and machine gunners who would open fire at rebel positions from the roof ,of the nearby Zamboanga City Medical Center.,The troops eventually reached the wall and bore a hole in it while dodging bullets from the enemy side. ,It was about 2 am. ,\",Kung hindi lang sa kasamahan namin nakikipagputukan, katay na kami doon. High risk ang ginawa namin. Medyo ,suicidal, yun e ,(If it weren't for the others who were engaging the rebels, we would have been massacred. It was a high-risk operation. It was suicidal.),\" recalled \"Dark Knight,\" one of those who led the approach.,But it turned out it's not the wall they needed. \",Hindi namin mapasok kasi yung pader pala na papasukan namin ,swamp,. T,apos ,walang access sa mismong, [KGK]. ,Hindi namin alam 'yung, floor plan. ,Walang, access (We coudn't enter because the wall was in a swampy area. It didn't have access to KGK, too. We didn't know the floor plan. It didn't have access),\" recalled \"Venom,\" one of the company commanders reporting to Llamas.,They had to retreat to the hospital. ,COMBAT ZONE: Close quarter battle in the coastal barangays of Zamboanga City. Rappler photo,Mortars, fires, and gun holes,They made a second attempt to seize KGK after lunch on the same day. But the rebels were already alerted, waiting for the soldiers to return.,The troops had to change tactics.,They then went around the building, moving from one street corner to another in tanks, running from house to house, hitting walls with mortars.,But the rebels proved to be well-trained in this type of battle.,\"We suspect that some of them have some sort of a training also. We see styles from Afghanistan or Pakistan. There were 3 layers before you can engage them, \" said Llamas.,Sometimes the rebels fired through holes in several layers of walls. ,It was hard to tell where the bullets were coming from and harder to see where the hostages were kept. ,And then there was the burning of houses and facilities that forced the troops to stop and prevented them from immediately closing in. Sometimes the troops had to sleep in half-burned houses.,The MNLF rebels had two advantages in the prolonged firefight: they had f,ood supplies inside the abandoned houses and they had hostages that they used as shields.,A soldier dies,On their 3rd attempt to take KGK, the elite troops suffered their first loss. They watched Corporal ,Michael Baltazar fall after a surprise attack from a rebel who suddenly appeared from a sewer. , ,Some of the men couldn't help their tears while they were engaging the enemies. \u201c,Kinuha ko ang baril ni, Baltazar. ,Dalawa na gamit ko. Sinabihan ako ng, CO (commanding officer) ,ko na \u201cKalma ka lang,, brother.\u201d ,Sa isip ko, gusto ko na talaga pasukin, KGK, ,(I took Baltazar's firearm and was firing 2 rifles. My commanding officer had to tell me to calm down. In my mind, I wanted to enter KGK),\u201d \"Wild Orchid\" recalled. ,9 LRB troops were killed ,\"Venom\" was wounded, too. A shrapnel hit his left hand and he bled profusely. Llamas had to order a master sergeant to drag \"Venom\" him by the collar to a tank that brought him to the hospital. ,It would take 5 difficult advances until the troops were able to take the building. But by then, the rebels had fled with their hostages. ,On September 18, the troops raised the flag on the roof of KGK and sang the national anthem. But this did not mean the end of the crisis; it only meant the rebels were deprived of a fortified base.,The soldiers continued to pounce on the rebels until they cornered them in a small area.,Hard lessons,Looking back, some of the troops say they should have made their move on Day 1, when one company of Light Reaction troops had the vantage point in a building where they could see the rebels marching with their hostages.,But the soldiers could not do anything. For the first 4 days they were ,paralyzed by negotiations held between government representatives and rebel emissaries for the peaceful surrender of Malik's followers. ,The soldiers told Rappler that during those days they played the battlefield in their minds; they would shoot the enemy, rescue hostages, show immense firepower. But it was tough to fight an imaginary war. When they got impatient, one officer mustered the courage to seek permission to attack. He was rejected.,The go-signal would come only the 5th day, September 13 (Friday the 13th), after President Benigno Aquino III arrived in Zamboanga City. (READ: ,Bungled chances in Zamboanga, and ,Zambo crisis: The fog of war,),By then the rebels had taken defensive positions and camped at the KGK with hostages, putting government troops at a disadvantage.,Worse, the troops were given two \u2013 but somewhat complex \u2013 orders: rescue the hostages and neutralize the enemy. They were two different missions that required different firearms and approaches. ,\u201c,Ano ba talaga sir,?,\u201d junior commanders would ask Llamas. He told them the priority was the safety of the hostages. ,Small team, , ,Llamas lost 9 men in the Zamboanga siege. ,He said he feels guilty that he was unable to visit their graves more often. , ,He also remembers considering to beg off from the operation. \"Technically, we were non-operational. Our unit was not filled up,\" he said. The military has always estimated their number to be 300 but, in fact, they are much smaller. The Zamboanga operation seemed too big for the small unit. , ,But Llamas also knew he couldn\u2019t say no., ,The troops also felt it was a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" operation cut out for them.  ,They've rescued hostages before and have surprised terrorists in their encampments, but there was nothing like the magnitude of Zamboanga City.  There were about 100 hostages held by close to 500 rebels in 5 densely populated barangays. The elite troops' 13 years ,of training would be put to test., ,\"It was the real world. It's no longer training,\" said Wild, ,Orchid, 42, who joined LRB in 2003., ,The crisis would drag for 21 days, too long for a unit that is trained to finish a job in 3 days. In the end, the ,combat zone was  razed to the ground.,The LRB would get help from a company of Navy Special Operations Group (NAVSOG), the equivalent of the US Navy Seals, whose training was closest to the LRB except their expertise is water. The LRB and the Navsog both fall under the Joint Special Operatios Group (JSOG) under the command of , Colonel Danilo Pamonag. (,READ: ,'The first to respond, the last to leave',),The Scout Rangers, too, helped. They occupied the frontlines when the LRB needed to rest. ,Surrounding them were over 2,000 other troops. The Air Force brought in soldiers from the different units nationwide. They conducted air strikes and took snapshots of the battlefield. The Navy guarded the shorelines and the mangroves, while the rest of the Army protected the perimeter of the combat zone. ,Everyone made sure that the rebels couldn't escape and they couldn't be reinforced., ,Deaths and injuries,In the hospital, \"Venom\" made sure he was released immediately when he learned that his platoon leader also died in combat. He wanted to return to his troops but Llamas said no. Llamas was planning to ,assign another officer to take Venom's place as company commander.,Llamas recalled how an angry \"Venom\" stared at him when he received the orders. The battalion commander stared back at the junior officer. Nobody said a word until \"Venom\" teared up. ,Llamas is laughing now but it was no laughing matter back then. ,\",Parang drama e. Kung gagawin mong, cartoons ,yun at may, talk bubble,, ang sinasabi niya sa akin,: ,P@*!!#!! mo, sir. ,Huwag mong gawin sa akin ito ,(It was so dramatic. If there was a talk bubble there, he was tell me: [Expletives] Please don't to this to me).\",\",Wala akong magagawa.  Naging, company commander ,din ako,. I know how he feels. ,Patay, platoon leader ,niya ,(I couldn't do anything. I was also a company commander. I know how he feels. His platoon leader died.),\" Llamas added.,Llamas allowed \"Venom\" to return to his men. ,\u201c,P@*!!#!!,, ,pumunta ka na,. ,Kapag na,-infect ,ang sugat mo ako mismo ang papatay sayo,! ([Expletives], go! If your wound gets infected, I will kill you myself.)\u201d,They could afford to laugh now. But what if another siege of that magnitude happened again? \"We're more ready,\" Llamas said. ,- Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/68885-zamboanga-siege-light-reaction-battalion", "title": "Zamboanga siege: Tales from the combat zone", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez"},

We will be part of his national influence, which is to help the country.),Once he begins work, Roxas ,will face issues, such as the anti-jueteng crusade as well as the bidding anomalies that allegedly involved resigned Interior Undersecretary Rico Puno.,Recently, Aquino also assigned him to help in settling the territorial dispute between the Philippines and China, ,naming him, a special envoy to China.

{"content": " MANILA Philippines UPDATED An international probe has cracked a pedophile ring which streamed live sexual abuse of Filipino children over the Internet leading to dozens of arrests police in the Philippines Britain and Australia said Thursday January 16.Under Operation Endeavour which spanned a dozen nations 29 people have been arrested including 11 in the Philippines while three other ongoing probes have identified 733 suspects Britain s National Crime Agency said.Fifteen child victims aged between six and 15 have been rescued it added. This is part of our intensified efforts to end this scourge... of live streaming of child sexual abuse to order by foreign pedophiles said Senior Superintendent Gilbert Sosa head of the Philippine police s anti cybercrime unit. This has become a major problem in the Philippines where in some cases even the parents are involved he told Agence France Presse declining to give specific details that could compromise ongoing operations.Sosa said that severe poverty had forced many youngsters into prostitution or into working in so called cybersex dens a booming business believed to be focused on the central island of Cebu.Britain s crime agency said Operation Endeavour began in 2012 with the discovery of obscene videos on a British pedophile s computer.The British man Timothy Ford was sentenced in March last year to eight and a half years in prison while an associate Thomas Owens was convicted four months later.Both men were said to have paid for live abuse of children on the Internet and had at one point planned to travel to the Philippines to carry out contact abuse of minors.Authorities in 12 countries were involved in the arrest of 29 suspects the British crime agency said. Of 17 British suspects five have been convicted and nine investigations are ongoing. Extreme poverty the increasing availability of high speed Internet and the existence of a vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organized crime groups exploiting children for financial gain it said in a statement.The agency called abuse in developing countries a significant and emerging threat . This investigation has identified some extremely dangerous child sexual offenders who believed paying for children to be abused to order was something they could get away with said Andy Baker deputy director of the agency s child exploitation and online protection command. Protecting the victims of abuse is our priority and that means attacking every link in the chain from dismantling the organized groups who are motivated by profit through to targeting their customers he added.The Australian Federal Police said it had executed six search warrants under the international operation that had led to the arrest of three Australians. Two of the men were arrested in Western Australia and one Sydney man was arrested by the Royal Thai Police in Bangkok it said. Hundreds of thousands of images and videos depicting online child sexual exploitation including children as young as five years old were found during the warrants. The Australian offenders allegedly financed and ordered child abuse shows from the Philippines.Britain s crime agency said three other investigations into live streaming of child abuse have netted 733 suspects globally including 139 in Britain and 594 overseas. xa0Philippine effortsPolice operations in the Philippines have focused in the impoverished village of Ibabao on Cebu island.In September last year a Filipino couple in their 30s were arrested in Ibabao for forcing their three young children to engage in sex acts and charging clients up to 100 each to watch using webcams.Twelve other children were subsequently rescued also in Ibabao and put in the care of government social workers according to official police records. Other operations elsewhere in the Philippines are ongoing and we are not at liberty to discuss them at length because we might compromise them he said.Meanwhile the Palace said it continues to work towards tackling human trafficking through the Inter Agency Commission Against Trafficking of the government which includes several government agencies and all law enforcement agencies in the country.On Thursday as news of the sex ring broke out in international news sites Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Sonny Coloma insisted that even before the recent reports the government has already committed itself to doing everything that needs to be done through inter agency effort through legislation and through other administrative measures to stop this xa0trafficking. He gave assurances the National Bureau of Investigation NBI and the Department of Justice DOJ are looking into the matter. This is a matter of high priority for our government that is not prompted by recent media reports he said. I would like to emphasize that our government is determined to stop xa0human xa0trafficking xa0in all its forms and manifestations through concerted action by all concerned government agencies in cooperation with other countries. Coloma said the sex abuse ring also highlights the importance of the Cyber Crime Prevention Law which penalizes cybersex and child pornography. The law has since been halted temporarily by the Supreme Court about a month after it was signed into law following controversial provisions on libel. xa0 with reports from Natashya Gutierrez Rappler.comWebcam on a computer screen image from Shutterstock ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/europe/48082-uk-us-australia-police-probe-ph-sex-abuse-ring", "title": "Int'l police probe PH child sex abuse ring", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130937-zamboanga-del-norte-jalosjos-assassination-try,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145863-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding-reception,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano"},

{"content": " In this file photo Brazilian President Michel Temer offers a press conference at Planalto Palace in Brasilia on November 27 2016. Evaristo Sa AFP BRASILIA Brazil Brazil s President Michel Temer defiantly rejected a bribery charge against him as a soap opera on Tuesday June 27 saying there is no proof and vowing to fight on. The charge is a fiction Temer said in his first public reaction since the country s top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot filed the corruption charge with the Supreme Court late Monday June 26. Where is the concrete proof of my receiving this money Temer asked as he made a nationally televised statement at the presidential palace in Brasilia.Temer attacked Janot for creating a soap opera plot that sought to paralyze Latin America s biggest country as it tries to exit a painful recession. I will not allow myself to be accused of crimes that I did not commit. My intention is to work for Brazil. I will not shirk the battles he said.Temer the first sitting president of Brazil to face criminal charges is accused of accepting bribes from a giant meatpacking company. xa0He is also under investigation for obstruction of justice and belonging to a criminal organization.If the lower house of Congress votes by a 2 3 majority to accept the charge the center right president would be suspended for 180 days and face trial in the Supreme Court.However Temer s aides say they are confident he has sufficient support in the scandal plagued Congress where dozens of lawmakers have been caught up in the same sweeping graft probe to get the charge thrown out.A source in the presidency speaking on condition of anonymity told Agence France Presse that the task of securing at least 1 3 of the votes in the lower house would not be the end of the world. Janot responded to Temer s statement insisting there is masses of evidence... leaving no doubt about the substance or the authorship of the crime of passive corruption. Unpopular but resistantMany regular Brazilians say they are losing faith in all their politicians.Temer s latest approval ratings are just 7 lower even than his leftist predecessor Dilma Rousseff whom he replaced last year when she was impeached and removed from office by his congressional allies for the relatively technical fault of breaking budgetary rules. Of course you could switch the political class with other people but the most corrupt ones in this whole affair would probably escape unharmed said Nicolas Crapez 34 on his way to work at the state government in Rio de Janeiro.But with the public so far failing to exert pressure in the streets as happened during mass demonstrations against Rousseff Congress may prefer to keep its head down.Many lawmakers are themselves facing corruption investigations. Also there is no agreement on a corruption free consensus candidate who could fill Temer s shoes until scheduled elections in October 2018 if he were removed.Still Janot appears intent on denying Temer an opportunity to clear his name quickly since the bribery charge is likely to be followed separately by others each one going to the lower house of Congress for a vote.Public anger at Temer could eventually intensify. xa0One of his strongest comments Tuesday stating I don t know how God put me here immediately came in for withering mockery on social media with memes juxtaposing the words alongside comic photos such as a cow stuck on a telegraph pole.Cash and secret tapeThe bribery charge is linked to the arrest of a close former presidential aide caught carrying a suitcase stuffed with 500 000 reais about 150 000 in cash that prosecutors say was part of payments from JBS meatpacking executives to Temer.Temer acted in violation of his duties to the state and to society Janot said citing abundant proof of bribe taking.Temer says that his former aide was acting independently and that there is nothing to link him to the suitcase. The aide is in detention facing corruption charges but has so far refused to cooperate with prosecutors.Meanwhile the obstruction of justice investigation accuses Temer of approving a plan with Joesley Batista owner of JBS parent company J F to pay hush money to a politician jailed for corruption.Batista secretly recorded Temer allegedly discussing the hush money and gave the recording to prosecutors in a plea bargain to secure leniency in his own corruption case.

Yet until his appointment as Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) secretary in 2010, he never ventured beyond the city's political confines.,It came to a point when people began to wonder why -- for all the glory and honor conferred on him -- Robredo wouldn't spread his political wings beyond Naga City. ,Love affair with Naga, ,Jesse Robredo and Naga City shared a love affair that spanned almost 2 decades. He got elected mayor of Naga City for the first time in 1988. He was 29 at the time. ,After he reached the 3-succeeding term limit set by the Constitution, he chose to take a hiatus from government in 1998 instead of vying for a higher post.,Money was a consideration. In a 2007 interview with the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, ,Robredo said he did not even have the resources to run for a bigger jurisdiction,, whether for Congress or for provincial governor.,Naga City was his comfort zone. In an interview with this author for a ,Newsbreak, article published in April 2006, Robredo said, \u201cI am more comfortable at the local level, where you immediately see the results of your labors, where you have clear limitations.\u201d,Robredo had a charisma that endeared him to the common man. It was not unusual, locals say, to see the mayor in slippers, shorts, and white shirt helping sweep the streets or cleaning up the drainage days after a typhoon. ,But he became better known for the reforms he instituted in office. In the early years of his administration, Robredo had to contend with a practically stagnant economy that caused revenues to sink so low that Naga City was downgraded from being a first-class to a third-class city. ,The traffic problem then was fast becoming a huge headache. Thousands of squatters filled Naga\u2019s vacant lots, hoping to land jobs in the city. The city was mired in gambling and other organized crime.,Award-winning reforms,As mayor, among the first things the young Robredo tackled was helping resettle the squatters and slum dwellers who comprised some 25% of the city population. ,He also cracked down on gambling and other illegal activities, and improved collection of taxes to close the budget deficit. To ease traffic, the bus and jeepney terminals were relocated to the outskirts of the city. ,From a third-class city teeming with syndicates and squatters, Naga City was eventually restored to a first-class city teeming with businesses and civic-minded citizens.,His urban poor program, ,Kaantabay sa Kauswagan, (Partner in Progress), was hailed as one of the Best Practices for Human Settlements by Habitat for Humanity. The city piled on so many awards in the Asian Institute of Management\u2019s Galing Pook Awards that, it was eventually elevated to the Hall of Fame. In 1999, Naga was cited by ,Asiaweek, as one of the \u201cMost Improved Cities in Asia.\u201d,In 2004, the city\u2019s I-Governance program was chosen as one of the Global 107 Best Practices at the Dubai International Awards. The city was also a recipient of the United Nations Public Service Awards for applying information and communications technology in governance. , ,I-\u00adGovernance is essentially about making the budget and all the services, contracts, transactions, revenue collection, as well as names of accountable officials and employees of the city available to the public. ,The program was implemented either through the city\u2019s website, www.naga.gov.ph, or through a directory of sorts that the city government published and gave away for free to all the households and establishments in Naga.,COMMON TOUCH.

Roco's brother Ramon happened to be Robredo's rival when he first ran for mayor in 1988.,The Lakas-Laban coalition in 1995 provided the opportunity for the Robredo and Roco camps to merge forces. When Roco ran for president in 1998, Robredo was already one of his staunch supporters.,Meantime, the tiff with Villafuerte continued to serve as a virtual Damocles\u2019 sword that hung over Robredo's political career. His uncle made a number of determined efforts to get Robredo disqualified from public office -- even going as far as denying blood relations.,Robredo's grandfather was Chinese, the older Villafuerte said, who fooled his family into thinking that they were related.,NAGA CITY VISIT. Mayor Jesse Robredo shows then Senator Benigno Aquino III around the city during a visit in September 2009. (Photo from Robredo's Facebook account) ,Going national,A close friend and ally of incumbent Transportation Secretary Manuel Roxas III, Robredo joined the campaign team of then Sen Benigno Aquino III after Roxas agreed to slide down as vice president in the 2010 presidential elections. ,Because of his stature, he was regarded as the ideal \u201cconductor\u201d of the Aquino machinery. He was supposed to run not just the conventional, but also the \u201cnon-conventional\u201d campaign, dealing with political parties and traditional politicians, as well as with civil society. ,Aquino would later say, after the elections, that they had disagreements over \"management style.\" The president, campaign insiders said, was unhappy with how Robredo packed his campaign schedule to the brim. ,Suddenly, the multi-awarded mayor -- who was deemed a shoo-in for the post of Interior and Local Government secretary -- was no longer standing on solid ground. It didn\u2019t help that former Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay, who beat Roxas as vice-president, was also interested in the post. ,Robredo was among the last to be named to Aquino\u2019s Cabinet, appointed only on July 9, 2010 and even then, only in an acting capacity. ,His authority as Local Government chief was also eroded when Aquino appointed a close friend, fellow gun enthusiast Rico Puno, as Undersecretary for Peace and Order. Puno, who was appointed on July 2 -- a full week ahead of Robredo\u2019s appointment -- was designated in charge of the Philippine National Police (PNP), a crucial arm of the department.,The curious dynamics between Aquino, Puno, and Robredo came to the fore during the fateful Quirino Grandstand hostage-taking tragedy of Aug 23, 2010.,In the Senate investigations following the incident,  Robredo admitted he \u201cwas out of the loop\u201d during the 12-hour crisis.,Puno, for his part, admitted he had \u201cverbal instructions from the President to oversee the PNP,\u201d as well as such crucial agencies as the Bureau of Fire Protection, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, the Public Safety College, and the Philippine Center for Transnational Crime.,Days after the Quirino Grandstand hostage-taking incident, Aquino took responsibility for the debacle, admitting that when he offered the local government post to Robredo, he told him \u201cto address concerns such as coming up with a comprehensive plan on delivering social services and relocating informal settlers in coordination with the local governments.\u201d He admitted telling Robredo that he would retain direct supervision over the PNP.,Despite the President\u2019s admission, critics latched on the Quirino Grandstand incident to further undermine Robredo\u2019s tenure at the DILG. ,Sen Francis Escudero, a member of the Commission on Appointments, said the arrangement should have been made public at the time Robredo was appointed, and not only after the crisis. He said the bloody outcome of the hostage crisis put Robredo\u2019s competence in question.,But Robredo didn\u2019t even have to face the Commission on Appointments (CA) until a year later, when Aquino finally relented and elevated him to full-fledged member of his Cabinet.,On June 13, 2011, ,Aquino finally signed Robredo\u2019s ad interim appointment,, paving the way for the submission of his name to the CA. ,Until his ill-fated flight on Saturday, August 18, however, Robredo had yet to be confirmed. Before his flight to Cebu on Friday, August 17, he met with a national politician to discuss disaster risk reduction and his CA confirmation. It was among the few last acts he did as a politician.,He was supposed to come home to Naga, his comfort zone, to spend the long weekend with his family. He never made it.  - ,Rappler.com, ,*,Some information used in this article was sourced from the case study written by Michael Scharff, entitled \"Building Trust and promoting accountability: Jesse Robredo and Naga City, Philippines, 1988-1998,\" which was published in the ,Innovations for Successful Societies website,, Princeton University. ,The case study is republished here with permission from Princeton University., , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/10886-jesse-robredo-s-journey-back-home", "title": "Jesse Robredo's journey back home", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/nation/148994-lacson-agot-isidro-duterte-magutom-ka-mag-isa,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161465-pagasa-defends-scientists-amid-project-noah-takeover,http://www.rappler.com/nation/10893-jesse-robredo-s-ramon-magsaysay-award-citation"},

China's proposed belt and road initiative will connect China to economic circles in Europe. Graphic by Raffy de Guzman, based on China Daily map ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 With President Rodrigo Duterte's pivot to China comes promises of support and improved diplomatic relations between the Philippines and the Asian regional giant.,Duterte's 4-day state visit had ,trade and investments, on the main agenda. It also yielded ,13 cooperation pacts, and deals in areas ranging from maritime security to agriculture.,During the bilateral talks, China also welcomed the Philippines' participation in its much-touted \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative \u2013 a revival of the ancient silk road trading route that would link Asian markets with economic circles in Europe.,This \"trade and infrastructure network\" is seen as the center of China's \"economic diplomacy.\",What is China's Belt and Road initiative?,China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative aims to link the economic circles in East Asia and Europe, connecting China \u2013 on land and over water \u2013 to  partners in Asia, Europe and Africa.,Chinese President Xi Jinping first ,introduced the concept, in 2013 during a visit to Kazakhstan. ,Xi said that with nearly 3 billion people inhabiting areas covered by the proposed economic belt, it \"represents the biggest market in the world with unparalleled potential.\",The Chinese government said the initiative aims to promote \"common development and prosperity and a road towards peace and friendship by enhancing mutual understanding and trust, and strengthening all-round exchanges.\",It added that the \"ambitious\" initiative requires countries to work together to improve infrastructure in the region, establish a network of free trade areas, create a secure and efficient network of land, sea and air passages, and promote mutual understanding and friendship among countries.,What will it comprise?,According to the ,vision and action plan, released in 2015, the initiative comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.,The Silk Road Economic Belt will link China, Central Asia, Russia and Europe (the Baltic). China will be connected to the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea through Central Asia and West Asia. It will also be connected to Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Indian Ocean. ,The initiative will focus on building a new Eurasian Land Bridge and developing China-Mongolia-Russia, China-Central Asia-West Asia and China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridors.,Meanwhile, the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road will connect China's coast to Europe through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean in one route, and from China's coast through the South China Sea to the South Pacific in the other route.,It will focus on \"jointly building smooth, secure and efficient transport routes connecting major sea ports along the Belt and Road.\",Response to proposal,China has secured the support of several countries along the route of the proposed economic belt. In February 2014, China reached a consensus with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the ,construction of Russian railways, across Europe and Asia. ,China has also announced that it would pour $46-billion worth of energy and infrastructure projects in the ,China-Pakistan Economic Corridor,, which would link Gwadar in Pakistan to Kashgar in China. ,In Kazakhstan, a ,new transit railway, aims to link the East and West, facilitating the flow of goods along the ancient silk road trade route.,For its maritime silk route, China secured the ,support of the Maldives, \u2013 which straddles major international shipping lanes \u2013 with both countries promising to \"enhance cooperation in other areas, such as marine, economy, and security.\" ,China is also courting support among ASEAN countries, which are key partners for the success of its maritime silk road initiative. ,But a stumbling block here is China's tensions with neighboring countries over claims in the contested South China Sea. Experts in Indonesia, for example, have warned that China may have a \"hidden agenda,\" and that the Asian superpower might use the route to expand its military powers. ,Meanwhile, Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio had previously said that China needs ASEAN to realize its maritime silk road.,\u201cChina needs ASEAN so they can start with their Maritime Silk Road, which passes through the South China Sea. China needs the rest of the world in their One Belt, One Road plan. They need our support for their Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Why will these countries support China if China is grabbing their maritime zones?\u201d Carpio ,pointed out in 2015,. ,China is claiming virtually the entire South China Sea, and has been at odds with the Philippines over this issue. Earlier this year, the Philippines won a favorable ruling from an international tribunal over the sea dispute, but China has been adamant about its refusal to recognize the ruling.,The Philippine government under the new Duterte administration, however, has softened its stance toward using the favorable ruling to press its claim. Before his state visit to China, Duterte had said he wanted a \"soft landing\" when dealing with China over the controversial issue.,On Thursday, October 20, Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold ,bilateral talks, on the maritime dispute. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/149535-china-belt-road-initiative", "title": "FAST FACTS: China's Belt and Road initiative", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/business/5808-ph-growth-linked-to-east-asia,-particularly-china,-says-world-bank,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/146873-independent-foreign-policy-philippines-duterte,http://www.rappler.com/technology/169861-wannacry-ransomware-cyber-attack-lessons,http://www.rappler.com/world/specials/southeast-asia/asean-journey/158443-philippines-launches-asean-2017,http://www.rappler.com/nation/149161-trade-economy-duterte-china-visit,http://www.rappler.com/nation/149774-ph-china-sign-coast-guard-cooperation-pact"},

Photo by Benhur Arcayan/Gil Nartea/Malacanang Photo Bureau,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 After announcing he is taking a leave from his post as Liberal Party (LP) president, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas on Saturday, September 29, disclosed he could be replaced by either Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya or Budget Secretary Butch Abad.,Roxas announced his leave after he ,took his oath, as secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) before President Benigno Aquino III.,He said under party rules, the executive vice president (EVP) should assume the post of party president in case of any vacancy. The EVP, however, was the late Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo, who died in a plane crash last August.,Roxas said the party's secretary general, Abaya, will then move to the position of EVP, making him eligible to occupy the post of LP president.,\u201cIt could be Secretary Jun Abaya who will assume the duties and responsibilities or it may be our vice president also, Secretary Butch Abad. And the party will make that announcement accordingly,\u201d Roxas explained, referring to a crucial event on Monday, October 1, when the LP will reportedly announce its senatorial line-up for 2013.,In a news conference after his oath-taking, Roxas said he took a leave as LP president to avoid conflicts of interest.,Roxas said Aquino, LP's chair, was initially surprised with his move to temporarily part with the LP.,\u201c,Pero nag-usap kaming muli at nagpapasalamat ako at tinanggap niya na mas mabuti, mas madali, mas magaan para sa paggagawa ko ng trabaho na hiwalayin,,\u201d Roxas said. (But we discussed this again, and I am thankful that he saw that it will be better, easier, and lighter in performing my duty if ties are temporarily cut.),The new DILG chief will have to deal with local leaders, forming relationships that could be made complicated by the 2013 elections. The LP, which he served as president, is fielding a senatorial slate that ,could well be a litmus test, for the Aquino presidency. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/13308-who-will-replace-roxas-in-lp", "title": "Who will replace Roxas in LP?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130937-zamboanga-del-norte-jalosjos-assassination-try,http://www.rappler.com/nation/13299-roxas-takes-over-dilg,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections-2013/12234-2013-polls-and-beyond-aquino%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98litmus%E2%80%99-tes"},

Malaca ang Photo BureauMANILA Philippines It s another government initiative to improve the worsening traffic in the Metro.On Wednesday January 22 President Benigno Aquino III launched Skyway Stage 3 which will run from Buendia Makati City to Balintawak Quezon City. The 14.8 kilometer elevated expressway will connect the South Luzon Expressway SLEX to the North Luzon Expressway NLEX and is estimated to cost P26.5 billion. Maliwanag po mababawasan ang traffic sa EDSA at sa iba pang pangunahing kalsada sa kalakhang Maynila dahil madaragdagan ang kalsadang puwedeng tahakin patungo sa katimugan at hilagang bahagi ng Luzon. Tinatayang 55 000 sasakyan araw araw ang ikaluluwag ng mga kalsadang ito Aquino said. It is clear traffic on EDSA and other major roads in Metro Manila will decrease because we are adding another road that those heading to the northern and southern part of Luzon can traverse. It is estimated that these roads will free up space taken up by 55 000 cars every day. When the project is completed the travel time from the North to the South is expected to take only 15 20 minutes. Currently it takes two hours.Aside from saving time money and gas the President highlighted the new expressway s added benefits 6 000 direct jobs and 10 000 12 000 indirect jobs during the period of construction.The launch marks the start of construction but will be busiest starting April this year. The project is expected to be completed in April 2017 but an accelerated plan may mean completion as early as mid 2016.Anticipate trafficThe construction of Skyway Stage 3 has been a long time coming.As early as the 1970s plans for the Manila North and Manila South Expressways were already being discussed including roads connecting Rosales Pangasinan to Lucena Quezon. My vision is still clear but I don t think we have an expressway in Rosales yet and neither do we have one in Lucena. After several decades it s only now that we re launching the third part of the Metro Manila Skyway which was started in the 90s Aquino said.The President said his government found solutions to legal and constitutional issues that impeded construction spoke to private companies and found solutions to finish the project.He also asked the public for their patience as construction is expected to cause some congestion in the following years. To our countrymen I ask for a little patience and understanding. This is a huge project. We cannot just sleep and expect there to be a giant helicopter that can just plop a Skyway on the road so when we wake up the project is complete. It s important that we are all one in whatever adjustments we have to make to give way to this construction he said.In lauding the project Aquino could not help but take a swipe at his critics specifically actor turned senator Ramon Bong Revilla Jr who slammed Aquino s administration for its supposed poor performance in a privilege speech early this week. READ Revilla hits Aquino for crooked justice Aquino pointed to the Skyway as a real and concrete project delivered by a just and good government for the benefit of the Filipino people and not just a scene from a movie. xa0Rappler.com ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/business/48614-govt-launches-skyway-nlex-slex", "title": "Gov't launches Skyway project linking NLEX and SLEX", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/162642-new-nokia-3310-photos-specs-design"},

Little to no information is coming out of many areas of Eastern Visayas because of cut communication lines.    ,DEVASTATION IN TACLOBAN. A general shot shows houses destroyed by the strong winds caused by typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) at Tacloban, eastern island of Leyte on November 9, 2013. AFP/Noel Celis,MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) \u2013 The outside world is slowly getting an idea of the extent of damage left in the wake of Typhoon Yolanda (international codename Haiyan), with reports of at least a hundred dead and extensive damage to infrastructure.,Capt John Andrews, Deputy Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), told dzMM that he got reports of roughly 100 people presumed dead in Tacloban, \"and that's only the count of bodies on the streets.\",\"This report was relayed to us by our station manager so it is considered very reliable information,\" he told the station. The information was relayed by high-frequency radio to authorities.,In the town of Palo, Leyte, Energy Secretary Jericho Petilla, who was dispatched by President Benigno Aquino III to the province, told ABS-CBN he believes \"hundreds\" died due to Yolanda. ,Petilla, a Palo native, surveyed the damage aboard a helicopter.,\"We saw 24 corpses in Palo, but officials there reported to us that there are people in nearby areas planning to bring their dead to the town center,\" he said. ,\"Palo, Ormoc, Burauen... Carigara, they all looked the same. The buildings were all unroofed and littered with fallen trees.\",Of the region, ,Philippine Red Cross chief Gwendolyn Pang told Agence France-Presse, ,\"We have reports of collapsed buildings, houses flattened to the ground, storm surges and landslides.\" ,\"But we don't know really, we can't say how bad the damage is... hopefully today we can get a better picture as to the effects of the super typhoon,\" Pang added.,Guiuan, a fishing town of about 40,000 people on Samar, was the first to be hit after Haiyan swept in from the Pacific Ocean. Pang said contact had not yet been made with Guiuan.,She also said relief workers were trying to reach Capiz province, about 200 kilometers west of Tacloban, on Panay island where she said most of the region's infrastructure had been destroyed.,Tacloban is Eastern Visayas' regional administrative center, and the capital of Leyte, a province of at least 2 million people. Little to no information is coming out of many areas of Eastern Visayas because of cut communication lines. ,'Completely ruined' airport,STILL ALIVE. A man searches for salvageable materials among debris of his destroyed house near Tacloban Airport, eastern island of Leyte on November 9, 2013. AFP/Noel Celis,Andrews also said, \"According to the station manager the airport is completely ruined.\",Andrews also told dzMM that clearing operations at the Tacloban City airport began at 5 am after airport operations there were completely down. \"The news I received is there was nothing left of the Tacloban airport but the runway,\" he said.,Andrews later recounted the assessment of the airport manager to the Agence France-Presse, saying, \"The terminal, the tower, including communication equipment, were destroyed.\",Rappler's Rupert Ambil, who arrived at the Daniel Z. Romualdez airport, reported a lack of public transportation for relief workers. This forces everyone to walk from the airport to the provincial capitol, he said. It also makes relief efforts and supply deliveries more difficult.,While communication remains limited and reports remain sketchy and inaccurate, National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) spokesman Rey Balido told dzMM radio in an interview on Saturday morning, they have gotten \"initial contact\" from their team in the city Friday night, November 8.,\"They said the damage inflicted by super typhoon Yolanda was severe,\" he said in the interview. \"They said there are barely any houses [left] standing.\",Balido said a few buildings reportedly remain intact but that most houses were crushed by fallen trees. He said they are still trying to determine the exact number of casualties.,\"Our team there said many died but they were unable to tell us how many,\" he said.,Call for volunteers,PRIORITY RELIEF. The government says it is now prioritizing providing relief to Tacloban City, which was badly hit by super typhoon Yolanda. Photo by Rappler,The government expressed alarm on Saturday about the unfolding scale of the disaster.,\"We are very concerned about the situation there,\" Cabinet Secretary Rene Almendras told reporters, when asked about the deaths in and around Tacloban.,\"The President is asking why there were still fatalities.\",A journalist on the ground in Tacloban described chaos in the wake of Typhoon Yolanda, with \"a lot of wounded\" from the typhoon and hospitals unable to treat everyone due to the number of injured. The reporter also noted \"looting everywhere\" as people in Tacloban scramble for supplies, such as water.,The city was previously cut off completely from all contact to the outside world, and government officials were at a loss as to the extent of damage in the city. ,In a separate interview with radio dzBB, Secretary to the Cabinet Rene Almendras backed Balido's statement, saying he also received reports of massive damage in Tacloban City, which led to the government's decision to send a C-130 flight with relief goods to the city.,\"We are very concerned with the situation in Tacloban that is why (Social Welfare) Sec. (Dinky) Soliman is on the C-130 now flying to Tacloban,\" he said.,He also called for volunteers.,\"We are at the stage of rescue and relief. Our priority right now is to bring relief goods,\" he said.,Military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Ramon Zagala told Agence France-Presse that ,15,000 soldiers had been deployed to the disaster zones. \"We are flying sorties to bring relief goods, materials and communication equipment,\" Zagala said.,Government relief goods are on their way to Tacloban City as of posting time. ,'Like a war zone',South of the city, the Visayas State University in Baybay City, Leyte \u2013 being used as an evacuation center \u2013 was described as being \"like a war zone,\" a resident told Rappler Mover Derek Alviola.,One of the most intense typhoons on record, Yolanda whipped the central part of the country for most of Friday, November 8, and terrified millions.,Yolanda smashed into coastal communities on the central island of Samar before dawn on Friday, with maximum sustained winds of about 235 km/h and gusts of up to 275 km/h, according to PAGASA. Foreign meterologists said it hit land with winds of 315 km/h, one of the strongest ever recorded. It is one of the most intense typhoons ever to make landfall.,Yolanda swept across the Visayas, destroying phone and power lines, as well as homes and vital infrastructure. - ,with reports from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com, ,More from our coverage:", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/43285-initial-reports-damage-tacloban-city", "title": "Tacloban devastated; at least 100 dead", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/weather-alert/43183-20131108-yolanda-am-update"},

Photo by Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Senator Alan Peter Cayetano is serious about running for president in 2016 that he has put together a team to work on campaign preparations.,According to several sources familiar with Cayetano's plans, the 43-year-old senator is closely monitoring surveys to make sure he remains in the running and is viewed by Filipinos as a possible and feasible presidential candidate.,The goal is to be within competitive range by June this year, although sources say current surveys already suggest he has a chance.,As early as now, his team \u2013 headquartered in a building in Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, where his wife is mayor \u2013 is preoccupied with making sure he is on the people's radar.,At least two people close to him say Cayetano is looking to release ads as early as in the next few weeks to create buzz and get a feel of people's sentiments. He is also tapping a foreign political adviser who is dishing out tips on best practices, running a campaign, and the like.,But Cayetano is not the only one from the Nacionalista Party (NP) \u2013 of which he is secretary-general \u2013 who has presidential aspirations. His party mate Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr has also expressed interest in running for the country's top post, while there is renewed talk of NP head ,Manuel Villar Jr running again for president. Villar lost the presidential race in 2010 to Aquino.,Not subtle about intentions,Cayetano has not been completely subtle about his intentions.,While he has not confirmed publicly that he plans to run, he has not denied his political aspirations either. In a ,television interview,, Cayetano dropped hints, but said it depends on timing.,\u201cAnyone who\u2019s in politics, from barangay captain to senator, who says that he or she doesn\u2019t want to be president is hypocritical. Everyone wants it. But are you the best person for a certain time is another question. Is it 2016, 2022, 2028? Those are the questions,\u201d he said then.,On his website, Cayetano's selection of featured news also hints at his plans.,A story from ,Abante Tonight, ,on the Association of Barangay Councils (ABC) polls, was posted on Cayetano's site on Jan 23, 2014. It was titled ,\"ABC election, patikim sa 2016 presidential elections?\", (ABC election, a sneak peek into the 2016 presidential elections?),The piece talked about the tight ABC presidential race between Edmund Abesamis ,and Cayetano's candidate Yasser Pangandaman being a \"proxy war.\" Abesamis is backed ,by two possible contenders in the 2016 presidential polls: Interior Secretary and rumored ruling Liberal Party (LP) bet Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas II and declared hopeful Vice President Jejomar Binay.,Abesamis won 65-44 over Pangandaman but the report described the polls as a \"basis that Cayetano has the capability to activate and fund his own machinery against political powerhouses like Roxas and Binay.\",It also described Cayetano as a \"third force\" who is making himself and his ability to form a national machinery felt.,Hitting Binay,Additionally, Cayetano has noticeably taken a ,more aggressive stand against Binay several times in recent weeks,. Earlier this month, the senator criticized Binay for calling pork barrel scam conduit Ruby Tuason's testimony \u2013 which implicates his political ally Sen Jinggoy Estrada \u2013 a \"dud.\",A few days later, he said Binay's comment \"is scaring away possible witnesses.\" He also said if Binay were elected president in 2016, \"there are fears that the [justice department's] cases against all of those implicated in the pork barrel scam will not be pursued as those being charged are his political allies.\" (READ: ,Expedite pork trial before 'Binay admin',),In December 2013, he also hit the vice president\u2019s family over the Dasmari\u00f1as gate incident, saying the actions of Binay\u2019s son, Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin \u201cJunjun\u201d Binay Jr, smacked of abuse of power.,In an ,earlier interview with ANC,, Binay said he believes ,\u201c3 political parties [are] vying for the position of president and vice president.\" He mentioned the NP, the LP, and his own United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), adding he doubts \"Lakas will join, they might just coalesce [with other groups].\u201d,As it stands, Binay's prediction might come true. While Binay is the only one who has announced his candidacy, Roxas is believed to be LP's bet after the interior secretary stepped down in 2010 to make way for Aquino's presidential bid, and subsequently failed in his vice-presidential bid against Binay. If all goes well for Cayetano, he may be NP's bet, although sources say there is a possibility he could run independently.,Senator Ramon \"Bong\" Revilla Jr, chairman of Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD), also said in the past he was ,not closing his doors to running for President,, but that was before he was linked to the multi-billion-peso pork barrel scam, for which he now faces a plunder complaint before the Ombudsman.,Everyone's critic,Cayetano comes from a political family \u2013 he is the son of the late Senator Renato Cayetano, and is the younger brother of Pia, also a senator. His younger brother Ren was councilor of Muntinlupa, while Lino, his youngest brother, is the incumbent representative of the 2nd district of Taguig.,His wife is Taguig Mayor Laarni \u201cLani\u201d Cayetano. (READ: ,The Cayetanos: A conjugal rule in Taguig,),He first ran and won as senator in 2007, finishing 9th with 11.79 million votes. Before that, he was congressman of Taguig for two terms.,Cayetano ran in 2013 under the administration's senatorial ticket, Team PNoy, which won 9 out of 12 seats. The coalition ran against the opposition UNA of Binay. Although the NP and the LP were bitter rivals in 2010, the two parties entered into a coalition with Aquino's party \u2013 dictated by the politics of necessity.,He ,finished 3rd in the 2013 senatorial race,, garnering 17.58 million votes behind Grace Poe and Loren Legarda.,In the 15th Congress, Cayetano ,headed the minority bloc in the Senate, but was, and continues to be, supportive of the Aquino administration, having voted to impeach former Chief Justice Renato Corona and voting in favor of the controversial reproductive health law. He was also supportive of the sin tax law although he was not included in the voting.,But Cayetano remains a staunch critic of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. As congressman of Taguig-Pateros, he was spokesperson of the team that sought Arroyo\u2019s impeachment.,Later, as chair of the Senate blue ribbon committee, he led the probe into controversies involving Arroyo\u2019s close allies, like the botched NBN-ZTE deal and the fertilizer fund scam. He also pushed for investigations into reported election fraud in 2004 and 2007.,Cayetano is an advocate of the Freedom of Information Bill, having proposed his own version in the Senate. His advocacies center on anti-corruption, fighting poll fraud, education, and children\u2019s rights. ,\u2013, ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/51787-cayetano-eyes-2016-presidency", "title": "Cayetano eyes 2016 presidency, forms team", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/nation/50768-lp-np-2016-cayetano,http://www.rappler.com/nation/46387-binay-cayetano-rift-fort-dasmarinas"},

He sometimes swept the streets himself.'    ,Editor's Note: ,Below is the citation for the Ramon Magsaysay Award that was conferred on Jesse Manalastas Robredo more than 10 years ago, on Aug 31, 2000. En route to Naga City on Saturday, Aug 18, 2012, Robredo's plane crashed near Masbate City. After several days of searching, deep-sea divers found his body on Tuesday, August 21., , ,CITATION for Jesse Robredo,Ramon Magsaysay Award Presentation Ceremonies,31 August 2000, Manila, Philippines, , ,It is sad but true. Democratic government is not necessarily good government. Too often, elections yield power to the few, not the many. Injustices linger beneath the rhetoric of equality. Corruption and incompetence go on and on. Voters, alas, do not always choose wisely. And yet, in Asia and the world at large, much is at risk when democracy founders, because democracy is the hope of so many. Jesse Manalastas Robredo entered Philippine politics at a time when hope was high. As mayor of Naga City from 1988 to 1998 he demonstrated that democratic government can also be good government.,In the wake of his country's People Power Revolution in 1986, Jesse Robredo responded to President Corazon Aquino's call to public service. He abandoned his executive position at San Miguel Corporation to head the Bicol River Basin Development Program in Naga, his hometown. In 1988, he stood for election as mayor and won by a slim margin. He was twenty-nine.,Once the queen city of the Bicol region, Naga in 1989 was a dispirited provincial town of 120,000 souls. Traffic clogged its tawdry business district and vice syndicates operated at will. City services were fitful at best. Meanwhile, thousands of squatters filled Naga's vacant lands, despite the dearth of jobs in the city's stagnant economy. Indeed, Naga's revenues were so low that it had been downgraded officially from a first-class to a third-class city.,Robredo began with a strike against patronage. He introduced a merit-based system of hiring and promotion and reorganized city employees on the basis of aptitude and competence. He then moved against local vice lords, ridding Naga of gambling and smut. Next, he relocated the bus and jeepney terminals outside the city center, ending gridlock and spurring new enterprises at the city's edge. In partnership with business, he revitalized Naga's economy. Public revenues rose and by 1990 Naga was a first-class city again. Robredo's constituents took heart and reelected him.,Spurning bodyguards, Robredo moved freely among the people. By enlisting the support and active assistance of Naga's NGOs and citizens, he improved public services dramatically. He established day-care centers in each of Naga's twenty-seven districts and added five new high schools. He built a public hospital for low-income citizens. He set up a dependable twenty-four-hour emergency service. He constructed a network of farm-to-market roads and provided clean and reliable water systems in Naga's rural communities. He launched programs for youth, farmers, laborers, women, the elderly, and the handicapped -- drawing thousands into civic action in the process. No civic deed was too small, he told the people, including the simple act of reporting a broken street lamp. He sometimes swept the streets himself.,Consistently, Robredo prioritized the needs of the poor. Through his ,Kaantabay sa Kauswagan, (Partners in Development) program, over forty-five hundred once-homeless families moved to home-lots of their own. They became part of Naga's revival. So did a revitalized city government. Applying techniques from business, Robredo raised performance, productivity, and morale among city employees. As a culture of excellence overtook the culture of mediocrity at City Hall, Naga's businesses doubled and local revenues rose by 573 percent.,Reelected without opposition in 1995, Robredo urged the Naga City Council to enact a unique Empowerment Ordinance. This created a People's Council to institutionalize the participation of NGOs and people's organizations in all future municipal deliberations. When obliged by law to step down after his third term, the popular Robredo made no effort to entrench his family. His advice to would-be leaders? \"You have to have credibility.\",In electing Jesse Robredo to receive the 2000 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service, the board of trustees recognizes his giving credence to the promise of democracy by demonstrating that effective city management is compatible with yielding power to the people. - ,Rappler.com,Related Stories:", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/10893-jesse-robredo-s-ramon-magsaysay-award-citation", "title": "Jesse Robredo's Ramon Magsaysay award citation", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/business/168878-roberto-lim-dotr-undersecretary-aviation-resigns,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating"},

It will trigger a fundamental reexamination of the basic security and political assumptions of its allies, partners, and friends in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, and may even spill over beyond it \u2013 a global game changer.,There is no doubt America has the capacity to undertake any action anywhere in the world to protect its core interests. But winning a war with China may even be as great a challenge as waging one \u2013 a tantalizing possibility that has to be addressed with great courage and vision.,On the second question, the answer is clear: China\u2019s leadership has made clear to the world that the People\u2019s Republic of China (PROC) has indisputable sovereignty over the SCS/WPS within its so-called 9-dash line, and will defend it by any means possible.,China also declared, that it does not recognize the July 12, 2016 ruling made by the international arbitral tribunal in The Hague which, among others, invalidated its so-called nine-dash line.,China\u2019s actions are consistent with its dream which aims to recover its dignity from the hundred years of humiliation inflicted by the western powers by working to the top of the global pecking order. The SCS/WPS are an integral part of the China dream not only for their resources but a secure nuclear submarine pen for a second-strike capability.,China has recently initiated the beginning of a geostrategic arc connecting China to the Middle East, Africa, and Europe by land and sea through its One Belt One Road (OBOR) project. The ports, airports, energy centers, and the like that will be established along OBOR will be supported by its newly created Asia Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB).,Philippines vs China,This is the context where the Philippines \u2013 weak as it is \u2013 rose to protect and defend its core interests, including its maritime entitlements.,It may be recalled that the US earlier brokered a deal which provided that the Philippines\u2019 and China\u2019s vessels simultaneously withdraw from the Scarborough Shoal. The Philippines complied with the deal\u2019s provisions but China did not.,Subsequently, the Philippines \u2013 which earlier had engaged China in long and exhausting bilateral talks that produced no positive outcome \u2013 filed a case in The Hague regarding China\u2019s illegal claims and activities in the SCS/WPS.,With the support provided by the US, Japan and Australia together with other allies, partners, and friends in the world, the ,Philippines overwhelmingly won its case,.,When the tribunal ruling was released on July 12, 2016, the US leadership cautioned the littoral countries involved in the SCS/WPS dispute \u2013 the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia \u2013 to handle the ruling with restraint.,Need for an independent foreign policy,DUTERTE AND CHINA.

{"content": "\nThe Binay camp responds to Cayetano's criticism of the Dasma incident by raising the Makati-Taguig Fort Bonifacio rivalry     ,DASMA TO FORT. The Binay camp responds to Cayetano's criticism of the Dasma incident by raising the Makati-Taguig Fort Bonifacio rivalry and Cayetano's reported 2016 plans. File photos ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 No moral ascendancy. ,In effect, this was the message of the Binay camp to Senate Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano, who called on, Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin \"Junjun\" Binay Jr to go on leave ,after the ,Dasmari\u00f1as incident, on November 30. ,The incident was reported by the ,Philippine Daily Inquirer, on Thursday, December 19.,\u201cIf I recall correctly, no one asked the local chief executive of Taguig to go on leave when armed employees of the Taguig public safety department went on a rampage on McKinley road and this was recorded on CCTV and shown in media,\u201d ,Joey Salgado, spokesperson of the Binay camp, told Rappler in a phone interview on ,Saturday, December 21. ,Salgado was referring to Cayetano\u2019s wife, Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano.,Salgado described as \u201cmost unfortunate\u201d Senator Cayetano\u2019s statement that the Vice President must ask his son to go on leave and face an investigation for his and his security guards\u2019 behavior. ,Salgado took a side swipe at Cayetano by bringing ,up the Makati-Taguig scuffle over ,Bonifacio Global City (BGC),. ,The mayor\u2019s eldest sister Senator Nancy Binay, also hit Cayetano for ,riding on the issue for his own 2016 ambitions.,Mayor Binay is under fire for insisting that his convoy be allowed to pass through the Banyan gate of the exclusive Dasmari\u00f1as Village close to midnight, contrary to the subdivision\u2019s rules. Cayetano weighed in on the issue in a press briefing Friday.,Cayetano said the issue smacks of special treatment and presents a challenge to the Aquino administration. He criticized Mayor Binay, saying it was an issue of \u201cabuse\u201d and not courtesy as the Binays claimed. ,Cayetano said, \u201cWill he (Vice President) treat him (Mayor Binay) any differently? Or will he give him special favor? Is this a preview of a Binay administration if he becomes the President?\u201d,Reported to be seeking higher office in 2016, the senator also referred to Vice President Binay\u2019s declared presidential bid. ,\u201cIf you want to be President of the country and you want an administration that is free of abuse, you have to make a painful decision.\u201d,Incident at the Fort,Salgado did not respond to Cayetano\u2019s points but instead brought up a September incident when Taguig\u2019s Public Order and Safety Office (POSO) clashed with Makati employees at the height of the two cities\u2019 territorial row over Fort Bonifacio. He said back then, there were no calls for Cayetano\u2019s wife to go on leave.,\u201cOn the contrary, what Mayor Binay did, true to his character, was, he went to the city hall and talked to the mayor and the matter was resolved peacefully and amicably,\u201d Salgado said.,The spokesperson was referring to Mayor Binay\u2019s decision to visit Mayor Cayetano at the Taguig city hall, where the two agreed to settle their cities\u2019 differences peacefully in court.,The Makati-Taguig and Binay-Cayetano rivalry intensified after the ,Court of Appeals favored Makati\u2019s appeal, to declare some parts of Fort Bonifacio and some others barangays (villages) to be within the city\u2019s territory and not Taguig\u2019s. Taguig is appealing the decision.,The September incident arose when POSO employees removed \u201c,Welcome, BGC, Makati,\u201d banners on McKinley Road in Forbes Park. This sparked a scuffle, with POSO personnel supposedly harming a barangay staff recording the incident with a cellphone.,Mayor Lani Cayetano then said she will not tolerate her employees\u2019 wrongdoing, but also criticized Mayor Binay for claiming authority over BGC. The two mayors clashed over whether or not the court\u2019s decision was immediately executory.,Nancy hits Cayetano\u2019s \u2018publicity\u2019 ploy,Senator Binay, who was in one of the vehicles in the convoy, also took a swipe at Senator Cayetano for commenting on the Dasma incident. ,\u201cI kept quiet when employees of Taguig were seen on CCTV entering McKinley road in Makati acting in an aggressive manner,\u201d she said in a statement Saturday.,\u201cI am not one who comments on every issue just to get publicity and to advance any political plans,\u201d she said,. \u201cAt hindi ko ugaling manira ng ibang tao para lang malagay sa media.\u201d ,(I don\u2019t make it a habit to destroy other people to be in media.),As a colleague in the Senate, Binay said Cayetano could have just asked her what happened. ,Run-up to 2016,The recent exchange of words between the Binay-Cayetano political dynasties is just the latest in a rivalry that began with the rift over Fort Bonifacio, and which is seen to be a preview of the run-up to the 2016 presidential polls.,Cayetano is the secretary-general of the Nacionalista Party (NP) of former Senator Manny Villar. The NP allied with the ruling Liberal Party (LP) in the 2013 midterm polls. The Binays are stalwarts of the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA).  ,Senator Cayetano dismissed the Binays\u2019 insistence that Mayor Binay deserved courtesy as chief executive, saying that Dasmari\u00f1as village was  private property. This was a point that village resident economist Winnie Monsod and netizens also raised.,Pressed about this, Salgado pointed to the statement of Valenzuela Representative and former Valenzuela Mayor Sherwin Gatchalian, a key ally of the Binays.,\u2018Mayor\u2019s authority is clear\u2019,\u201cAs to the extent of the authority of any mayor, whether in Makati, Valenzuela, Taguig, what Congressman Gatchalian said was very, very clear. The authority of the local chief executive is very clear,\u201d Salgado said.,In a statement Friday, Gatchalian said, \u201cthe actions of the security guards totally disregarded the authority vested on Mayor Binay as the leader and father of the city.\u201d,\u201cIf a mayor cannot enter or leave a property within the area of his jurisdiction because of supposed rules and regulations that were drawn and implemented by a group of private individuals, then this would surely diminish his effectiveness as the leader of his town or city,\u201d Gatchalian said.,Yet Cayetano questioned this argument. He said it went against President Benigno Aquino III\u2019s campaign against the ,wang-wang, mentality, referring to politicians\u2019 abuse of power and sense of entitlement.,\u201cIt might seem like a small issue for others. But in the eyes of the poor, this is ,wang-wang,, this is abuse,\" Cayetano said.,In a statement released Saturday afternoon, Salgado also said that \"disrespect for an elected official is something we don't want to wish on anyone.\" He added, referring to Cayetano, \"We know the good senator will be the first to take offense if armed private security guards of an exclusive subdivision surround the convoy of the mayor of Taguig in a gesture of disrespect.\",Cayetano earlier said, \u201cThe issue is not because he is a Binay. The issue is because of the abuse, and my personal information is, this is not the first time this has happened.\u201d,Will Mayor Binay face probe?,Cayetano also called on the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to investigate the incident. He said though that DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, also a potential 2016 presidential contender, can inhibit himself from the probe. Roxas is the president-on-leave of Aquino's LP. ,Asked if Mayor Binay was open to face an investigation, Salgado said, \u201cThat is speculative. We don\u2019t answer speculative questions.\u201d,What does the Binay camp make of Cayetano\u2019s statements and his references to 2016?,\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go further than [our] statement,\u201d Salgado said. ,\u2013 Rappler.com , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/46387-binay-cayetano-rift-fort-dasmarinas", "title": "Binay-Cayetano rift: From Fort to Dasma and 2016", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/68370-star-magic-ball-2014-best-dressed-gowns-red-carpet,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/nation/35667-fort-bonifacio-makati-boundary-dispute,http://www.rappler.com/business/211-governance/38036-taguig-makati-in-banner-war-over-fort"},

President Benigno Aquino III watches the Video Launching of the New MMDA Traffic Signalization System. Photo by Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The goal is less traffic.,With the Metro ,becoming more and more congested,, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) inaugurated a state-of-the-art Traffic Signalization System (TSS) on Wednesday, January 8, that is expected to reduce traffic and travel time, and make the roads safer for pedestrians and commuters.,The advanced traffic management network will be based in MMDA's new Command and Control Center in Makati City.,At the launch, President Benigno Aquino III said the new center \"will serve as the brains for the monitoring and movements of the MMDA in its thorough observations of the traffic situation, disasters and public security.\",\"Aside from its quick communications technology, it can also observe over 400 intersections in Metro Manila,\" he said.,The system will initially manage 85 priority intersections and 25 video surveillance locations. Phase 1 of the project also includes the installation of 36 units of 45-inch video screens that will monitor 150 CCTVs in the metropolis. It will also increase the number of stoplights with countdown timers.,The system is expected to eventually manage up to 500 intersections across Metro Manila.,Phase 1 costs more than P295 million, while the other phases are continuously being studied and prepared with a target to finish Phase 3 by 2016 when the President steps down.,Aquino said it would also help the MMDA respond to problems on the road. (,READ: Taming the traffic beast of Metro Manila,),\"For example, if the CCTV camera shows that one road has traffic, and the other is free-flowing, the Command and Control Center can control the time and speed of the green and red lights on the intersection, in order to free up the road making the flow of traffic more efficient,\" he said.,The President added the upgrade comes at an opportune time. The old signalized system has been in place for 14 years now, resulting in defective computers in 424 intersections, and damaged traffic lights and loop detectors.,The number of cars on the road also continues to rise. In 2013, the registered vehicles in Metro Manila reached over two million, resulting in heavy traffic. The Philippines has 7.6 million total registered vehicles \u2013 meaning close to 30% of all vehicles are in the Metro.,Aquino said the traffic also affects the economy because of the time, money and gas wasted, with the National Economic and Development Authority pegging the daily cost of traffic at P2.5 billion.,Follow the law,Because of the headaches caused by traffic, Aquino said the government continues to look for solutions to the Metro's congestion problem.,He said in addition to his administration's implementation of the Metro Manila Integrated Transport System, Uniform Ticketing System, Truck Ban, flood control, rerouting and road reblocking \u2013 this project is the government's newest initiative.,\u201c[The system] can analyze and consolidate information for faster mobility, improved road safety, optimized vehicle flow and pedestrian movement, and reduced travel times,\u201d MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said.,He said the TSS \"aims to upgrade, automate and optimize the management and traffic engineering installations\" around the Metro.,But for now, as the project has yet to be completely rolled out, Aquino appealed to Filipinos to do their share in helping decrease traffic.,\"My request to our countrymen is this: I hope we can be disciplined on the road. Even if sometimes, we are tempted partly because of irritation or boredom on the road, let us not make this a reason to break the law or cheat the system,\" he said.,\"This is for the good of all of us anyway. So whether you drive a car or a motorcycle or you're just a pedestrian crossing the lane \u2013 let's follow the rules. Let us not wait until an official or a camera catches us, or until we are punished, before we learn to follow the law and the system.\",He said as President, he himself has refrained from using his presidential privilege to clear roads when he travels and refuses to use a ,wang-wang, or blaring sirens.,\"But this does not mean that I am passing on this privilege to others. You know, nobody has the license to use a ,wang-wang, mentality, and act like a king on the road,\" he said. ,On November 30, Makati Mayor Junjun Binay \u2013 son of Vice President Jejomar Binay \u2013 allegedly ordered the arrest of 3 security personnel from the posh Dasmari\u00f1as Village in Makati after his 4-car convoy was ,not allowed to exit through one of its gates,. ,The Binays were ,criticized for their ,wang-wang ,mentality,. - ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/47505-mmda-launches-high-tech-system-to-reduce-metro-traffic", "title": "MMDA launches high-tech system to reduce Metro traffic", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/business/168878-roberto-lim-dotr-undersecretary-aviation-resigns,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/41439-traffic-hell-exit-strategy,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/15854-taming-the-traffic-beast-of-metro-manila"},

{"content": "\n'An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,' says Microsoft's Brad Smith    ,BOUND. The WannaCry ransomware attack locked out 200,000 computers, with perpetrators asking for US$300 as a ransom fee. Illustration by Nico Villarete/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 A massive cyberattack hit the world on Friday, May 12, United States time, affecting 200,000 computers in 150 countries \u2013 and counting. ,The attack, making use of a malware called \"WannaCry,\" locked down the computers and encrypted the files within, rendering them unusable for the users. The actors behind the attack, which have yet to be identified, then asked the victims for ransom money to \"free\" the infected computers.,For this reason, the WannaCry saga is called a \"ransomware\" attack \u2013 one of the biggest ever. One chief research officer at a cybersecurity firm, Mikko Hyponnen of Helsinki-based F-Secure, called it the \"biggest ransomware outbreak in history.\",As of writing, though, the infection and its effects have been somewhat contained, thanks to a United Kingdom cybersecurity researcher who goes by the handle @MalwareTechBlog on Twitter. The researcher, along with security firm Proofpoint's Darien Huss, discovered the WannaCry \"kill switch,\" which has slowed down the malware's progress.,The malware, however, continues to spread as new variants appear, stressing the need for the populace to remain vigilant and for the government, tech firms, and cybersecurity experts to sustain their efforts against the malware. (Read: ,Global pushback curbs cyberattacks but disruption goes on,),In the wake of the malware's spread and current containment, what have we learned from these cyberattacks? Here are a number of lessons and observations: , ,1) The US government has been using software vulnerabilities as a tool. ,The code used by WannaCry is said to have come from the United States' National Security Agency. The NSA has been taking note of security vulnerabilities found in software used by people \u2013 in WannaCry's case, Microsoft Windows \u2013 and been developing code to exploit these.,The code can then be used as a way to gather information from users, essentially like spyware. In WannaCry's case, the code had been stolen and had fallen into the hands of criminal actors. In a ,blog post,, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, likened the leak to a missile being stolen from the US military: \"An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.\" ,Smith also said that the governments of the world should treat the attack as a wake-up call: \"They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\"(Read: ,Microsoft says cyberattack should be wake up call for governments,),Rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit the vulnerabilities, Smith said, that governments should instead be required to report the vulnerabilities to software vendors. , ,2), ,Institutions, organizations have to be aware of their over-,reliance on tech-enabled systems.,It's unlikely and counter-intuitive for the world to go back to the old ways. But if there's one thing that the attacks have re-emphasized, it's that the world has evolved to be extremely reliant on computers, connected devices, and applications \u2013 perhaps a little too much so. ,The question is, are we ready to completely rely on digital systems? The newest round of attacks appear to be saying otherwise. ,The question rings even harder for certain sectors. Witness: Britain's National Health Service (NHS). \"Sixteen hospitals in the United Kingdom were forced to divert emergency patients after computer systems there were infected with Wanna,\" reported cybersecurity blog ,Krebsonsecurity,. This means that people could have died because the attacks put a stop to normal hospital procedures. ,Given this and the current weaknesses of cybersecurity measures, should national healthcare systems rethink their reliance on computer systems, and come up with standardized emergency operational procedures that's less computer-reliant? It's a bandaid solution, but one that critical industries and sectors may have to consider \u2013 until cybersecurity measures prove they can prevent cyber strikes from grinding operations to a complete halt. ,WANNACRY INFECTION MAP. MalwareTechBlog, a 22-year-old British cybersecurity researcher who works for threat intelligence company, Kryptos Logic, shows the worldwide reach of the WannaCry virus. Screenshot from MalwareTechBlog/Twitter , ,3) Cybersecurity needs a whole-of-society approach.,One reason that the attacks were so effective was that systems weren't updated properly. Vendors, such as Microsoft, release security patches from time to time. For the vulnerability that the WannaCry malware exploited, Microsoft released one such patch last March 14, 2017. ,However, not everyone downloaded and implemented the patch, contributing to the fast spread of the malware. What has happened highlights just how critical it is to keep systems updated. While a newer virus can just come in and override even the latest updates, implementing the latest available patches will still offer more security as opposed to not doing so. ,Governments, as Microsoft suggested, need to understand that software vulnerabilities can be weaponized \u2013 and one that certain entities are looking to steal and use for criminal goals. ,Microsoft and other tech companies, whose products are used by millions, will have to sustain efforts to enhance cybersecurity measures and cybersecurity awareness. Somehow, companies have to be responsible for their own legacy software too \u2013 especially when it's still in use by a considerable number of people. ,Microsoft, for instance, ended support and the issuance of security patches for their operating system (OS) Windows XP in 2014. Reports said that, ,approximately ,90% of healthcare facilities, under UK's National Health Service still use the 16-year-old Windows XP. The continuing use of the old OS is one of the conditions that contributed to the spread of WannaCry.,The question here is, how should tech companies deal with or help organizations that haven't upgraded yet to newer systems such as Windows 8.1 or 10?,Should they push stronger for the adoption of the newer OSes and make users aware of the downsides of not doing so? Should tech companies be made to continue to support legacy software if it can be proven that people are still using them? Or should governments and its agencies, and private organizations be mandated to update their systems once support for a software officially ends?,We've already seen what happens when no action is taken. , ,4) Backing up one's data can offer viable protection from ransomware,Ransomware finds leverage through the value of the information they kidnap. One simple way for people or organizations to make sure the malware can't kidnap the information completely is to back up information or data on either the cloud or a separate storage. That's one of the easiest way to prevent oneself from being victimized by ransomware.,However, it's not a complete all-in-one solution. Sometimes, in the case of organizations or institutions employing individuals, the actual device is needed for operations. Organizations can indeed migrate their software-enabled operations to the cloud, but employees will still need an actual device to access the cloud. In this case, mere file backups will not suffice \u2013 unless the organizations are willing to invest in backup equipment  to be deployed in emergencies. \u2013, Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/169861-wannacry-ransomware-cyber-attack-lessons", "title": "What we've learned from the WannaCry ransomware attacks", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/32044-warning-fake-maria-ressa-email,-fake-website,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/105704-star-magic-ball-2015-photos-best-dressed,http://www.rappler.com/video/reports/113621-vlog-aquino-china-asean-summit,http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/169925-global-pushback-cyberattacks,http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/169843-microsoft-cyberattack-wake-up-call-governments"},
{"content": " MANILA Philippines Amid a tense standstill between the Philippines and China over the disputed reef called Scarborough Shoal a leading World Bank economist stressed that the Philippines economic fate is closely linked to its mightly neighbor. xa0Of the Philippines trade and other economic partners the impact China is more prominent than the European Union s or the United States said World Bank s lead economist for the Philippines Rogier van den Brink at a press briefing on May 23.Every 1 decline in the Chinese economic growth may shave 0.52 off the Philippines own economic growth the economist shared. xa0This is higher than the 0.4 cumulative impact a 1 slowdown in the European and US economies may have he said. The integration with East Asia is quite strong particularly China. So a shock in East Asia of minus 1 growth will have a negative impact of 0.74 cumulatively on you the Philippines and China s part of that is 0.52 he said.Thus a threat the Philippines may need to worry about is the inevitable decline in China s economic growth this year which the World Bank expects to dip to 8.2 in 2012 from 9.2 in 2011.China accounts for 14.9 of the Philippines total exports with shipments amounting to 642.07 million according to March 2012 data from the National Statistics Office NSO . That makes China the Philippines 3rd largest trading partner and its 1st largest if exports from Hong Kong are included. China takes up 55.6 of the Philippines greatest export electronics.As for the other economic partners the US and Europe van den Brink said the Philippines has been relatively resilient to the slowdown in those regions.He cited the Philippines strong fundamentals including reasonable inflation rates increases in revenue collections runs in the local stock market and only a slight decline in the growth of remittances.The World Bank maintained its growth forecast for the Philippines at 4.2 this 2012 after a sluggish 3.7 in 2011.It predicts at 4.8 growth rate for 2013 lower than its 4.8 forecast last November.Charting the course forwardCharting their future economic course East Asian countries like the Philippines will want to head the headwinds from China. As China shifts away from its export oriented economy opportunities will open up for countries with consumer oriented export goods said Bert Hofman the World Bank s Chief Economist for the East Asia and Pacific Region.Hofman noted the World Bank s prediction that China will slow down to a 5 growth by 2020. More importantly we also see China s growth composition changing both from the supply side as well as on the demand side. Probably going to be more consumption led less investments led and more services and less industrial production he shared. Preparing for that trend now is important he stressed.He said Korea Malaysia and Thailand could benefit by sending more exports abroad and to China.Infrastructure productivityMeanwhile the Philippines will have to make strategic investments to take advantage of the same opportunity and to shelter itself from the drop in growth said van den Brink.He said this was the time to invest in well prepared infrastructure projects that would stimulate medium and long term growth that would withstand external shocks.He also stressed the need for increasing worker s productivity. Labor productivity in Asia lags far behind the United States and is only half of what Latin America is experiencing stressed Bryce Quillin an economist for the East Asia and Pacific Region.Economists pointed out that the Philippines has a unique growth opportunity its people. Other Asian countries are expected to loose their demographic dividend the growth of the working age population as compared to the total population said Quillin. Some of the most successful economies of the past number of years China Thailand Vietnam even Malaysia are all expected to experience a decline in the working age to total population. He said the development is concerning since This is a lost input to the existing model of growth so growth should be that much lower you may have a demographic trap. The Philippines therefore could be an exception. What sets the Philippines apart from the rest of the region is the demographic dividend. You don t have that problem. If you invest wisely now in infrastructure and people you will carry your demographic dividend for decades to come said van den Brink. Having a young and vibrant work force is one of those intangible benefits that is very difficult to replace it seems like if you want to begin to move towards a more innovative system of doing business having a young growing population is one of those attributes that you want to have. The decline of this effect in East Asia is concerning said Quillin.

China neither accepts nor recognizes it. Beijing does not accept any means of third party dispute settlement or any solution imposed on China it added reiterating its long standing position on the dispute.China has repeatedly denied the tribunal s authority to rule on the dispute with the Philippines over the strategically vital region claiming that the court s actions are illegal and biased against it.Beijing refused the opportunity to defend its position before the body.Despite China s assertions the tribunal s judgement was very law based said Julian Ku an expert on international at New York s Hofstra University adding that it did not uncritically accept the Philippines arguments . I was struck by how much the tribunal bent over backwards to give China opportunities to comment and participate in this case he added.The dispute has become the centre of a tense standoff between China and the US with Washington claiming that China s increasingly aggressive behavior in the region threatens free passage through the area s critically important shipping lanes.US ships and aircraft have patrolled the region including passing within the 12 nautical mile limit that would apply to any territorial waters in what is widely seen as an attempt to undermine Chinese claims of control.The court ruling however has invalidated any claims by anyone that the reefs and shoals under dispute give such legal rights.The decision is devastating for China s claims said Yanmei Xie China analyst for the International Crisis Group saying the ruling was as unfavorable to China as it can be .Despite the announcement the Chinese foreign ministry said the country continues to assert it has sovereignty arising from its historical claims. China s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea shall under no circumstances be affected by those awards the statement said adding that China opposes and will never accept any claim or action based on those awards. China was willing to negotiate directly with other countries on the basis of respecting historical facts and in accordance with international law it said including for joint development.In the short term the decision is unlikely to change much Xie said. We re going to see a continuation of the chest thumping we ve seen especially from the China side. Police sealed off the Beijing street where the Philippine embassy stands. More than a dozen white police vans were parked blocking all entrances to the street but no protesters were visible. xa0The full text of China s statement follows Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People s Republic of China on the Award of 12 July 2016 of the Arbitral Tribunal in the South China Sea Arbitration Established at the Request of the Republic of the PhilippinesWith regard to the award rendered on 12 July 2016 by the Arbitral Tribunal in the South China Sea arbitration established at the unilateral request of the Republic of the Philippines hereinafter referred to as the Arbitral Tribunal the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People s Republic of China solemnly declares that the award is null and void and has no binding force. China neither accepts nor recognizes it.1. On 22 January 2013 the then government of the Republic of the Philippines unilaterally initiated arbitration on the relevant disputes in the South China Sea between China and the Philippines. On 19 February 2013 the Chinese government solemnly declared that it neither accepts nor participates in that arbitration and has since repeatedly reiterated that position. On 7 December 2014 the Chinese government released the Position Paper of the Government of the People s Republic of China on the Matter of Jurisdiction in the South China Sea Arbitration Initiated by the Republic of the Philippines pointing out that the Philippines initiation of arbitration breaches the agreement between the two states violates the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS and goes against the general practice of international arbitration and that the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction. On 29 October 2015 the Arbitral Tribunal rendered an award on jurisdiction and admissibility. The Chinese government immediately stated that the award is null and void and has no binding force. China s positions are clear and consistent.2. The unilateral initiation of arbitration by the Philippines is out of bad faith. It aims not to resolve the relevant disputes between China and the Philippines or to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea but to deny China s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. The initiation of this arbitration violates international law. First the subject matter of the arbitration initiated by the Philippines is in essence an issue of territorial sovereignty over some islands and reefs of Nansha Qundao the Nansha Islands and inevitably concerns and cannot be separated from maritime delimitation between China and the Philippines. Fully aware that territorial issues are not subject to UNCLOS and that maritime delimitation disputes have been excluded from the UNCLOS compulsory dispute settlement procedures by China s 2006 declaration the Philippines deliberately packaged the relevant disputes as mere issues concerning the interpretation or application of UNCLOS. Second the Philippines unilateral initiation of arbitration infringes upon China s right as a state party to UNCLOS to choose on its own will the procedures and means for dispute settlement. As early as in 2006 pursuant to Article 298 of UNCLOS China excluded from the compulsory dispute settlement procedures of UNCLOS disputes concerning among others maritime delimitation historic bays or titles military and law enforcement activities. Third the Philippines unilateral initiation of arbitration violates the bilateral agreement reached between China and the Philippines and repeatedly reaffirmed over the years to resolve relevant disputes in the South China Sea through negotiations. Fourth the Philippines unilateral initiation of arbitration violates the commitment made by China and ASEAN Member States including the Philippines in the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea DOC to resolve the relevant disputes through negotiations by states directly concerned. By unilaterally initiating the arbitration the Philippines violates UNCLOS and its provisions on the application of dispute settlement procedures the principle of pacta sunt servanda and other rules and principles of international law.3. The Arbitral Tribunal disregards the fact that the essence of the subject matter of the arbitration initiated by the Philippines is issues of territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation erroneously interprets the common choice of means of dispute settlement already made jointly by China and the Philippines erroneously construes the legal effect of the relevant commitment in the DOC deliberately circumvents the optional exceptions declaration made by China under Article 298 of UNCLOS selectively takes relevant islands and reefs out of the macro geographical framework of Nanhai Zhudao the South China Sea Islands subjectively and speculatively interprets and applies UNCLOS and obviously errs in ascertaining fact and applying the law. The conduct of the Arbitral Tribunal and its awards seriously contravene the general practice of international arbitration completely deviate from the object and purpose of UNCLOS to promote peaceful settlement of disputes substantially impair the integrity and authority of UNCLOS gravely infringe upon China s legitimate rights as a sovereign state and state party to UNCLOS and are unjust and unlawful.4. China s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea shall under no circumstances be affected by those awards. China opposes and will never accept any claim or action based on those awards.5. The Chinese government reiterates that regarding territorial issues and maritime delimitation disputes China does not accept any means of third party dispute settlement or any solution imposed on China. The Chinese government will continue to abide by international law and basic norms governing international relations as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations including the principles of respecting state sovereignty and territorial integrity and peaceful settlement of disputes and continue to work with states directly concerned to resolve the relevant disputes in the South China Sea through negotiations and consultations on the basis of respecting historical facts and in accordance with international law so as to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. xa0Agence France Presse Rappler.com ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/139503-china-rejects-hague-tribunal-judgement", "title": "China rejects tribunal judgment on West PH Sea", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/business/16041-what-are-the-top-products-filipinos-buy,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/139638-encantadia-2016-cast-photos-grand-press-con,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano"},

{"content": "\nApplying more knowledge is more effective, and inclusive, than throwing money against a perennial and acute problem    ,Every commuter knows and feels that traffic congestion in Metro Manila is turning from bad to worse. More so during the Christmas rush. It has become the \u201cnew normal,\u201d an object of quiet desperations and frustrations. And perhaps because of our Catholic upbringing, many yearn for a redeemer, a Traffic Czar, as if that is the solution.,This writer believes otherwise. There are better and more effective ways.,Some caveats,At the outset, let me state a few caveats.,One, I claim no originality for these views. They are not novel. Nearly all the right remedies have been researched, tried and proven to work elsewhere, except in the Philippines where talk takes the place of action.,Two, there are no more painless (nor instant) solutions. We have virtually exhausted all the less painful solutions in the past, and deferred the more difficult ones. It will take decades of long-term commitment to lick the traffic beast. So far, our approach has been a dance of one-step- forward-two steps backward.,Three, building more roads will increase vehicular traffic, not bring \u201cdecongestion.\u201d The completion of a new road may indeed produce reliefs, but that will be transitory. We cannot pave over the entire metropolis, even if we have the money (which we don\u2019t have). Besides, the increase in the vehicle population exceeds our capacity to expand our road network. And if we consider road construction as the solution to solving traffic congestion, \u201cit is like buying a bigger pair of pants to solve the problem of obesity.\u201d,Four, no large cities ever solved their congestion problems by relying on private cars.  Urban mobility needs a good public transport system. More than 15 years ago, a traffic study counted 70% of daily trips being carried by public transport. That is probably at 60% now. That metric is 90% for Hongkong, 67% for Paris, 12% for Kuala Lumpur, 57% for Tokyo. Think how worse it would be, if the share of public transport in Metro Manila deteriorates further.,Five, gimmickry can entertain or make good copy, but not bring an iota of traffic relief. Exorcising demons from EDSA by invoking the gods, labeling streets as Christmas or Mabuhay lanes, or sticking OBR stickers unto buses provide diversions - but not from congestion. We\u2019ve seen it all before.,Making the best use of road assets,Our road network is inadequate, and we should maximize its capacity. That is the primary objective of traffic management, and the daily chore of MMDA. Right now, we are misusing our available road space \u2013 estimated at about 5,000 kilometers. How to get more throughputs from our limited road space?,Rehabilitate, upgrade and expand the computerized signaling system that enables coordination of signal timing and patterns across the road network, from one intersection to the next.,After 20 years and 4 project phases, the system has expanded to cover about 435 intersections by year 2000. Instead of expanding the system, as what a modern metropolis do, Metro Manila moved backward and dismantled nearly 50% of the intersections in favor of the primitive and uncoordinated U-turn schemes.,With a reduced coverage, the effectiveness of the signalization was drastically reduced and with it the overall capacity of the network. Most, if not all, of what remains have outdated timing patterns.,Corollary to the first, many of the U-turn schemes left behind by previous MMDA cavemen have to be dismantled. Before, only the outermost lanes were slow moving due to road side frictions arising from loading and unloading, egress/ingress to properties, and uncontrolled parking.,With U-turns, road side frictions now afflict also the innermost lanes. The outcome: reduced network capacity.  Moreover, replacing one move with three moves (1 left turn with an elongated double left turns+ right turn, which is what a U-Turn scheme is) is inefficient and accident-prone.,Private roads of gated subdivisions are untapped assets. They probably account for 20% of roads in the metropolis \u2013 especially in areas outside C-4. Although many are meant to provide local access, one can delineate a few that can be \u201copened\u201d, and thereby improve connectivity and network capacity.,A generalized opening of private roads would be opposed, but selective application can be acceptable. Imagine if Ayala Avenue (a private road) were closed to the public.  ,Re-invent public transport,The unfortunate fact is that government has neglected our urban public transport system \u2013 except for the occasional building of bus stops and loading bays, and recurring plans to build provincial bus terminals and ban them from urban roads. It has focused on expensive urban rail lines - which are necessary but hardly sufficient, and takes very long implementation times.  Even the enforcement of yellow lanes \u2013 meant to improve bus travel times - is flawed.,The jeepneys have become untouchables too long. Replace all of them gradually with better versions \u2013 low emissions, energy efficient, designed for urban commuting and taller Filipinos, equipped with GPS and  wired into an Intelligent Transport System (ITS).,This form of paratransit is despised by car users, but they carry nearly 50% of daily commutes and provide employment to a quarter million of the urban populace. And culturally, it has become an icon of Filipino pride (and sadly, also emblematic of backwardness).,Modernize the jeepneys and the way they operate on our streets and you throw out a \u2018heritage of smallness\u2019, to borrow from Nick Joaquin, aside from reducing air pollution. The old style of atomized management, tolerable in rural and small towns, becomes dysfunctional in a metropolis.,Re-organize buses and reduce the number of operators - only 2 per corridor. More than 600 bus operators do not conduce to branding and service differentiation, a fertile ground for  \u2018colorum operations\u2019. Manage their deployment under a Central Operations Center of a metro wide ITS. Seoul in South Korea demonstrated how it can be done. ,One current official was given a tour in Seoul, gushed about it, and returned pushing for something Seoul dismantled \u2013 an elevated roadway into the heart of the city. Ordering bus operators to engage drivers on salary basis helps in taming unruly street behaviour, but will cause hardly a ripple in traffic relief. The more enduring solution is to restructure the industry, change its exploitative business model. Pool the revenues and pay-out bus operators (and jeepneys also) on the basis of contracted trips made on predefined routes and headways.  ,Urban railway is at the top of the public transport hierarchy, but they cannot be everywhere. Less than 10% of daily trips are carried by the 4 rail lines. Expanding the system takes a few years, but our weak institutions stretch execution to decades. Line 1 extension to Cavite should have been completed in 2004; Line 2 extension to Masinag in 2009; and Line 3 upgraded 3 years ago.,These expensive assets are badly managed; maintenance is treated like a janitorial service. Bills to reform the rail sector have languished in Congress in the last 15 years. Everyone opted \u201cto kick the can down the road\u201d \u2013 including the necessity of adjusting fares.,While many countries - developed and developing - have already changed their business models, our railway entities are still locked in the archaic ways of the past.  The solution is to privatize all the three rail lines, including the PNR commuter service - akin to what was done on water supply.,If we want world-class rail transit, we have to professionalize their management. That will not happen under public sector management. Imagine your water faucets today, had the 'pain' of privatization not been done 15 years ago.,Instead of being rail-centric, BRT (bus rapid transit) lines in the major roads of Metro Manila will be the cost-effective solution to addressing urban mobility problems (as shown by many experiences in Latin America, Australia, and Asia).,It also offers a platform for the existing bus operators to work together. BRT systems have the potential to deliver passenger capacities comparable to railway systems, at a fraction of the cost of rail. Well-planned and designed BRT systems also put a high premium on customer service. ,After all, passengers are a public transport system\u2019s customers, and they deserve nothing less. It is more appropriate in Commonwealth Avenue, rather than MRT-7.,\u201cA developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It\u2019s where the rich use public transportation.\u201d,Little things that mean a lot,Let subdivisions and exclusive villages organize car pools. They should be generous with limited public use of some of their roads. Companies or buildings with large employee should do the same. Instead of promoting car ownership with their generous car-plans, they should also craft their respective public transport programs. Big business has to pay attention to the Commons, and not leave everything to the government.,Large private schools and campuses must do likewise. Traffic on Ortigas Avenue in San Juan, for example, is very bad because of three universities whose students are dependent on private cars. When 4 persons carpool, it takes away 3 cars out of the road. Built more in-campus dormitories for students and teachers to reduce need to travel.,Walk, if the distance is less than a kilometer. It is good for your health. Wait for your ride on designated bus stops, shun buses/jeepneys that pick up passengers anywhere. Local government units must rebuild sidewalks systematically, and as part of the building permitting system. Rome was not build in a day.,Large property developers should not externalize their respective traffic impacts. Instead, they should deliberately plan and execute schemes to integrate public transport into their complexes. Stop building communities anchored on private cars, build them for walkability.,Do more telecommuting. Let the work move, rather than the worker. Corporations and offices have enough brilliant minds to find creative ways to do it. Imagine if 10% of the more than 1 million extra daytime populations that swells Makati were to work at home; that would be 100 thousand less trips per day or 50,000 fewer cars on the road. Government can do no less, by putting on-line many government transactions that are currently traffic magnets.  ,Educate and re-educate traffic enforcers, bus drivers, and jeepney drivers, in that order of priority. This is a never-ending mission. Traffic is not just about roads, it is also about the human element. Good roads are made useless by bad drivers, but good and civil drivers make even bad roads function properly even without traffic enforcers. Perhaps, this is something the Automotive Association of the Philippines can embrace as a mission, in partnership with key government agencies.,Pricing, the forgotten lever,Pricing is the most efficient and effective solution to address a demand-supply gap. Motor vehicles have grown by more than 4% a year in the last 6 years, but supply of roads had barely moved. In 2003, the ratio of vehicle to road and rail supply was already low compared to Jakarta and other Asian cities; that has gone worse now.,To ration limited road space, MMDA has adopted a car-rationing scheme called number or color coding. Copied from Mexico, it should have been a short-term solution. Studies have shown that it engendered the \u201cCobra effect\u201d, inducing households to buy an extra car and to use them more intensively. ,It is time to abolish it. If government is too timid about road pricing ala Singapore or London, it could go the way of Jakarta: cars must have a minimum of 3 passengers to enter the CBD without penalty. Car poolers can be incentivized with low or free parking.,Restore balance in the pricing of public transport system. By holding back fare increases on LRT, the government has induced trips away from buses and jeepneys, who end up fighting more aggressively on the streets fishing for passengers.,The government has fixed fares on LRTs for the last 9 years, thus, the spectacle of overloaded trains and under-used buses on EDSA. You can take out 1,500 buses on EDSA without crowding on the remaining units. Operators will earn more, even at reduced fares, because the current level includes payments for inefficiencies. Re-balance the prices among different transport modes, and the imbalances will disappear.,Sans pricing, we have traffic lights to mediate conflicting demand for the same road space - based on the more egalitarian rule of first-come-first-served. However, the U-turns replaced this rule into a game of chicken.,Root causes of congestion,Congestion will continue to worsen, unless we tame the main culprits: population and economic concentration within the NCR. It accounts for 35.7% of the country\u2019s economic output, 18% of population and 28% of motor vehicles, on only 0.2% of land area.,The ultimate solution is to \u201cde-imperialize Manila\u201d. As a primate city, it breeds traffic jams on a mammoth scale. The flood of vehicles will continue to grow, and nothing can the hapless MMDA enforcers do to stop.,The question is how? Previous policies (e.g., growth pole strategies, ban on some activities within 50 km radius, decentralization, etc.) have failed \u2013 because they relied on institutions that are broken. Land use regulation is a big joke.,It should have been our first line of defence against congestion. We need a trigger that would unleash centrifugal forces to de-imperialize Manila.  My proposal is to relocate the centers of our 3 branches of government \u2013 one in Luzon, one in Visayas, and the third in Mindanao. Redistribute political power, economic power will follow, and traffic jam will ease.,Smart Cities,All of the above is a journey of a thousand miles towards smarter cities. Intensified use of telematics in public transport and traffic management will be the key to a more sustainable city. Google is on the verge of breakthrough on driverless cars. Our own LRT 2 is built to run without train drivers.,ICT has progressed to the point that the \u201cimpossible takes only a little time\u201d \u2013 if every Filipino will do his share. Sooner or later, Metro Manila has to bite the bullet and adopt electronic road pricing. Towards that end, the current plan of DOTC to replace vehicle plates with a new series should embed RFID into the plates.  ,Of course, many of the above can happen sooner, and in a more organized and systematic manner, if there is an orchestrator. Some would prefer to call that person a Traffic Czar, I prefer to call him a Traffic Champion or Conductor, not unlike an orchestra conductor. It would help if we have the likes of Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa (of Bogota) or Myung-Bak Lee (of Seoul).,But our tragedy is that there is no such bold visionary among our current crop of officials.  All are sprinters, when the need is for a marathoner. If President Aquino truly believes that his primary focus as the nation\u2019s leader is to \u201cchange the status quo so that it affects everybody,\u201d the horrible traffic situation of Metro Manila beckons him to change the game.,What is the cost of inaction? There are various estimates on the cost of traffic congestion.,My own estimate is based on the Vehicle Operating Cost model. Using 40 kph as non-congested norm for cities compared to what we now regularly experienced (15kph on 6 out of 7 days a week), the cost is Php48 billion annually plus another Php380 billion for lost time.,At 40kph, a journey of 40 km takes 60 minutes; at 15kph, same journey takes 160 minutes. A small improvement of 5 kph chips 40 minutes out of that same journey \u2013 equivalent to Php20 billion savings in vehicle operating cost and Php150 billion in time savings per year.,So much wastage is not sustainable in the long run. Metro Manila must break out from its obsession with vehicle mobility and shift into people mobility.,Applying more knowledge is more effective, and inclusive, than throwing money against a perennial and acute problem. - ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/15854-taming-the-traffic-beast-of-metro-manila", "title": "Taming the traffic beast of Metro Manila", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/153758-julia-montes-explains-star-magic-leave-cornerstone-entertainment,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/68370-star-magic-ball-2014-best-dressed-gowns-red-carpet"},
{"content": "\nApproaches by Manila and the MMDA to the traffic problem are wrong and will only lead to mutually assured destruction    ,These past two weeks, due to floods or bomb threats, many residents of Metro Manila were caught in monstrous traffic jams. ,Based on social media and radio reports, it is clear that citizens are reaching a breaking point. The anger is palpable, the blame laid squarely on the government and especially the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA).,It is our sense that we have reached a new low in the transportation crisis in the city and that the people\u2019s frustration is reaching a new peak. Unfortunately, this will not necessarily translate into rational and good decisions by government bodies, including local governments.,Take Manila\u2019s ordinance regulating the entry of city and provincial buses \u2014 allowing only those with terminals in Manila, to enter the city. This ordinance has been controversial, with complaints from both bus operators and commuters accompanying perceived gains in traffic reduction.,Questions have also been raised about the consequences of locating bus terminal hubs in strategic places in the north and south outskirts of Metro Manila. This is now being implemented by the MMDA for buses coming from the south, and it has been terrible seeing the chaos in the terminal during its first weeks of operation. Commuters are not only suffering major inconveniences but their commuting budgets have also increased considerably.,Indeed, if Metro Manila were a human body, it would be suffering from a terrible disease. It is a disease that, as of 2011, is costing us P137.5 billion, according to a ,study made by the UP National Center for Transportation,.,The challenge is how to treat this disease immediately since it can also spell the difference in the country\u2019s inclusive growth. But can we really say the disease has been properly identified?,Assured destruction,In this piece, we argue that traffic is not the main problem. If this is the lens we use to frame what we are facing, we are likely to make matters worse. The better approach is to see the challenge as one of inclusive mobility \u2013 that what we need in Metro Manila is a public transportation system that is affordable and can move people efficiently from their homes to their work places, and to and from centers of commerce and community life.,We credit Manila and the MMDA for exerting efforts to solve the problem, but we contend that their approaches are wrong and will lead only to MAD-ness. By MAD, we mean the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction, a concept popularized in the Cold War when nuclear war was deterred by the assurance of such destruction.,In the case of our transportation crisis, if this continues, other local governments will retaliate against Manila, and commuters will defy the rules, and worse, resort to even more colorum vehicles. Certainly by punishing the commuting public, those who take public transportation will now resort to private vehicles and just exacerbate traffic and chaos in our streets.,At the end of this think piece, we suggest options that could help us overcome the mobility challenge, a way out of MAD.,Statistics and the big picture ,Available statistics cover mostly the number of buses but seldom the number of passengers during peak hours. Earlier, ,Rappler reported , that according to the MMDA, there are 13,067 buses running in Metro Manila each day and around 60% (7,368) are from the provinces. If we used this data and the average reported bus loading capacity of 40.5 passengers (vis-\u00e0-vis 60 for full capacity), this will mean that the current bus system carries 529,213.5 passengers a day.,Other reports, also say that EDSA can accommodate only 1,600 bus units daily. If we used the current bus average loading capacity at 40.5 passengers, this number will conservatively carry only around 64,000 commuters. However the current reported statistics show that out of the estimated 300,000 vehicles using EDSA, only 1.2% (or 3,600) are city buses.,The data means that 24-km EDSA carries 145,800 commuters and 444,600 motorists (on average 1.5 occupancy level per private vehicle) daily.,The MRT is designed to carry around 350,000 passengers but according to estimates, as many as 540,000 passengers use the MRT daily. Metro Manila has a population of around 12 million (night time) and 14 million (day time). Given that 80% of this daytime population takes public transport, then obviously, the current number of buses and train coaches is inadequate. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why it is very difficult to weed out \u201ccolorum\u201d buses. ,However, this is not to say that \u201ccolorum\u201d buses are good. Anything illegal is always wrong. And anything that disrupts the smooth flow of traffic, especially those vehicles carrying the most number of individuals/commuters like buses, is bad.  ,But we believe it is time to look beyond the obvious. It is time to look at the big picture and learn to understand what matters most \u2014 mobility or the lack of it. At the end of the day, every Metro Manilan would love to have the option to choose which would be the easiest route, the most environmentally-friendly, the most socially friendly, or the cheapest one.,Research and the implementation cycle,In the transport sector, one of the most important data to study is the travel survey data which contain the origin-destination (including transfer points), trip purpose, transport modes, and travel time used, among others.,In most developed countries like Japan and the US, this kind of survey is already institutionalized. In the US, it is even being done periodically and the goal is quite clear: to assist transportation planners and policy makers who need ,comprehensive data on travel,.,In Guangzou, China \u2014 winner of the 2011 Sustainable Urban Transport \u2014 there were before- and-after studies (,http://www.chinabestpractices.net/,) for every project. They tracked down changes in physical aspects, movement, and how the public feels about them. This then becomes the basis for further improvement and for communicating information to the public.,In most cities of developed countries, a typical sustainable transport planning and mobility management cycle includes research (data collection); policy (if new ones or some revisions are needed); policy/project implementation; evaluation (research again); and improvement. More importantly, mayors, transport leaders and policy makers \u201cwalk the talk.\u201d In other words, they also use the public transport system and have a feel of the city to guide policy formulation.,Manila is the classic case that uses the cycle of \u201cpolicy-implementation-evaluation-improvement\u201d without seriously looking at the number of commuters affected.,The same seems to be true for EDSA.,MMDA has tried so many schemes on EDSA but most of these are related to regulating bus traffic. In fact, various versions of dispatching schemes have been tried and so far, none have worked very well.,It is important to note that MMDA is also limited by its mandate where buses are concerned. There is also the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) which is tasked to address franchise violations and enforce rules in such a way that bus companies are encouraged to improve their services.,It would be interesting to know how many of these erring companies were sanctioned, but it\u2019s also worth knowing how many commuters were directly affected.,On the other hand, the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC), the agency mandated to come up with solutions to our mobility needs, has been known to be working on a number of mass public transport projects.,In particular, it has been working on the acquisition of additional coaches to address the long overdue capacity expansion of the MRT Line 3. But the MRT Line 3 is considered a light rail transit that was built along EDSA despite the need for a higher capacity system. There could be new coaches, there might be improvement in the system, but the reality is, they will never be enough.,Transport hierarchy,The road-sharing concept supports the belief that the movement of people and things should follow the simple principle, \u201cthose who have less in wheels must have more in roads.\u201d This is incorporated in the Philippine Environmentally Sustainable Transport Framework (DOTC 2011). According to the report, the system should favor non-motorized locomotion and collective transportation systems.  ,As most transport scientists will attest, it is important to take note of this transport hierarchy: pedestrian, cyclist, mass public transport (trains like PNR or Philippine National Railways, MRT, LRTs, bus, and paratransit modes like PUJs, FXs), then private vehicles in that order.,Any roads built should prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, and mass public transport first. It is important to realize that only when we move the majority of people instead of vehicles can we effectively decongest our roads.,There is a need to also learn the lessons from abroad on how this concept is effectively applied using various innovations in improving bus systems or implementing bus rapid transit (BRT) systems. For instance, one can learn from the experience of ,Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority, in the US, wherein officials secured partnerships with the community once the bus services improved.,They had partnerships with college campuses, shopping centers, apartment complexes, and then asked them to pay for the better service. With a number of school campuses and growing Central Business Districts (CBDs) in Metro Manila, such partnerships are certainly worth considering. ,There are instances that a city decides to enhance transit in a densely populated corridor or build an entirely new system for the metro region and more often than not BRTs and LRTs are considered. The two have many similarities, including (when done properly) exclusive lanes and attractive stations.,BRT proponents often highlight the price, while LRT proponents usually point to capacity and style as ,marketing points,. BRT as a comprehensive transport choice is best seen in Curitiba, Brazil, Bogota, Columbia, Guangzhou, and the People\u2019s Republic of China, among others.,What\u2019s best,At the end of the day, it is best to consider what the commuters want, as well as to learn from past mistakes and from international models. The motorists may want speed, but for commuters it is the frequency of available modes of transportation.,Rather than debate on the technology, it is best to consider road geometry. Instead of focusing on direct service, there should be more seamless connections among the different public transport modes available, which, in turn, are connected to every community.,Jarret Walker summarizes it well in his book, \u201cHuman Transit,\u201d which says that most efficient transit systems focus on frequency, duration, speed, reliability, and capacity.,The implementation of the bus ban and integrated bus terminal in Manila has created ripple effects on the rest of the metropolis. But rather than debate on its merits, we should get our act together and start having truly inclusive mobility. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/41439-traffic-hell-exit-strategy", "title": "Our traffic hell, an exit strategy", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156674-duterte-christmas-eve-photos,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/ph-travel/133388-visayas-travel-destinations-beaches-falls-caves,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/business/13137-traffic-and-infrastructure-delays-cost-the-philippines,http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/208-infrastructure/34186-no-provincial-buses,-auvs-in-edsa-soon"},

(If the process for choosing candidates is done well, there\u2019s a big chance NP and LP will still be together in 2016.),Cayetano said the LP and NP successfully collaborated in 2013, when the administration\u2019s senatorial ticket called ,Team PNoy won 9 out of 12 seats., The coalition ran against the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) of Vice President Jejomar Binay.,The senator said the choice of candidates in 2016 will be a key factor on whether or not the partnership will extend to the next polls.,\u201cEveryone is idealistic and pragmatic at the same time. Ideally, NP wants the candidates to come from our party but pragmatically, who are the candidates? What will it take to win?\u201d Cayetano said.,\u201cNow, the direction of NP and LP, we are together but if as early as now, we are boxed out, our candidates will not be considered, then why will we join the LP? But if the President says, \u2018We worked together well. Let\u2019s leave a legacy behind [together]\u2026.\u2019 To be fair to the president, he treated us well.\u201d,Bitter rivals in the 2010 presidential polls, the LP and the NP entered into a partnership in 2013 to complete a senatorial line-up for the mid-term election. Yet the coalition did not hold at the local level, where the two parties ,fielded opposing candidates in several provinces,.,In 2010, Aquino and Villar competed for the presidency, with both sides accusing each other of resorting to black propaganda. A spokesman for Villar, Cayetano criticized Aquino at the height of the campaign, and coined the term \"Topak\" to allude to his alleged psychological incapacity. The LP cast doubt on Villar's claims that he came from a poor family.,After 2013, the LP and the NP continued their partnership at the Senate where both parties constitute the majority. LP campaign manager Senator Franklin ,Drilon was elected Senate President,, while Cayetano became majority leader.,\u2018What has Binay accomplished?\u2019,Asked if he will run for president or vice president, Cayetano said he needs more time to decide.

But are you the best person for a certain time is another question. Is it 2016, 2022, 2028? Those are the questions.\u201d ,The senator also said Binay should not have announced his presidential plans shortly after becoming vice president.,\u201cI don\u2019t think he should have announced on the first day after [winning] that he wants to run in 2016. What has he done as vice president? If he were my rival or as a voter, I will ask: What has he done? He cannot say, \u2018I\u2019ve done this in Makati\u2019 when he hasn\u2019t done it in the whole Philippines.\u201d,Cayetano said the same thing of Interior Secretary Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas II, who is being eyed to be the LP\u2019s standard bearer in 2016. The LP president-on-leave, Roxas ran against Binay for the vice presidency in 2010 but lost. Initially the LP's presidential candidate in 2010, Roxas gave way to Aquino after a clamor for him to run and survey results showed Roxas would not win.,\u201cOr supporting someone like Mar Roxas, I want to answer that question intelligently. Maybe by next year, there is time to assess that question, the middle of next year,\u201d Cayetano said.,Will Binay presidency be easy on \u2018pork\u2019 case?,Cayetano said in sealing the partnership with the LP in 2016, it is crucial for the NP that anti-graft reforms are institutionalized through bills like the Freedom of Information Act, and the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act.,He then raised questions on Binay\u2019s statements about the pork barrel scam case, the worst corruption scandal in recent Philippine history.

It will just be between the Philippine delegation and the Chinese counterpart said Barcelon.Arrangements were made for the forum with the China Chambers of Commerce he added. Having this meeting is a start of something good he told Rappler.Duterte s state visit comes 3 months after an arbitral tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines over China in their dispute in the South China Sea.The bid of then President Benigno Aquino III to pursue the case against China through international arbitration made amid China s xa0massive reclamation activities in the disputed area had xa0further soured relations between the Philippines and China. xa0Renewal of tiesBut Duterte has made friendly overtures to China on the one hand saying he won t flaunt the international arbitration ruling while on the other saying he wants stronger economic ties with the Asian giant.Reinvigorated trade between China and the Philippines is something Filipino businessmen look forward to said Barcelon. xa0The inclusion of a huge business delegation to Duterte s state visit is seen as a step closer to this. It s really the renewal of the closeness between China and the Philippines. Of course there has been a lot of trade going on between China and the Philippines but last year because of some of the issues the agri exports were affected said Barcelon.Bilateral investments between the two countries are heavily tipped to China s favor.Duterte is expected to hold bilateral meetings with top Chinese officials during his visit. They are expected to discuss the West Philippine Sea dispute fishing rights of Filipinos in the disputed areas and cooperation in curbing transnational crime and illegal drugs aside from trade and investments. xa0The Philippines is pursuing a two track system of dialogue with China to allow them to cooperate in some areas while separately handling contentious issues such as the maritime dispute.

The world's biggest ransomware attack strikes hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. ,LONDON, United Kingdom (UPDATED) \u2013 The world's biggest ransomware attack levelled off in Europe on Monday, May 15, thanks to a pushback by cyber security officials after causing havoc in 150 countries, as Microsoft urged governments to heed the \"wake-up call\".,President Vladimir Putin denied Russia, which has been accused of cyber meddling in several countries around the world in recent years, had anything to do with an attack that hit hundreds of thousands of computers.,\"Microsoft's leadership stated this directly, they said the source of the virus was the special services of the United States,\" Putin said on the sidelines of a summit in Beijing.,Putin said the incident was \"worrisome\" but had done \"no significant damage\" in Russia and called for urgent international talks on countering the hackers.,\"A protection system... needs to be worked out,\" he said.,Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, earlier said the code used in the attack was originally developed by the US National Security Agency.,He warned governments against stockpiling such code and said instead they should vulnerabilities to manufacturers \u2013 not sell, store or exploit them, lest they fall into the wrong hands.,\"An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,\" Smith wrote.,\"The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake up call.\",But global fears eased on Monday as the number of incidents reported levelled off.,The cross-border police agency Europol said the situation was now \"stable\", defusing concerns that attacks that struck computers in British hospital wards, European car factories and Russian banks would spread further at the start of the working week.,\"The number of victims appears not to have gone up and so far the situation seems stable in Europe, which is a success,\" senior spokesman for Europol, Jan Op Gen Oorth, told Agence France-Presse.,\"It seems that a lot of internet security guys over the weekend did their homework and ran the security software updates,\" he said.,Like stealing missiles,The indiscriminate attack was unleashed Friday, striking hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide by exploiting known vulnerabilities in older Microsoft computer operating systems.,US package delivery giant FedEx, Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica and Germany's Deutsche Bahn rail network were among those hit in the attacks, which demanded money to allow users to unblock their computers.,In China, \"hundreds of thousands\" of computers were affected, including petrol stations, cash machines and universities, according to Qihoo 360, one of China's largest providers of antivirus software.,French carmaker Renault said its Douai plant, one of its biggest sites in France employing 5,500 people, would be shut on Monday as systems were upgraded.,Europol executive director Rob Wainwright told Britain's ITV television on Sunday that the attack had been \"unprecedented\".,\"We've never seen anything like this,\" he said.,'Ooops' message, $300 ransom,The attack blocks computers and puts up images on victims' screens demanding payment of $300 (275 euros) in the virtual currency Bitcoin, saying: \"Ooops, your files have been encrypted!\",Payment is demanded within three days or the price is doubled, and if none is received within seven days the locked files will be deleted, according to the screen message.,Bitcoin, the world's most-used virtual currency, allows anonymous transactions via heavily encrypted codes.,Experts and governments alike warn against ceding to the demands and Wainwright said few victims so far had been paying up.,Security firm Digital Shadows said on Sunday that transactions totalling $32,000 had taken place through Bitcoin addresses used by the ransomware.,The culprits used a digital code believed to have been developed by the US NSA \u2013 and subsequently leaked as part of a document dump, according to researchers at the Moscow-based computer security firm Kaspersky Lab.,A hacking group called Shadow Brokers released the malware in April, claiming to have discovered the flaw from the NSA, Kaspersky said.,The attack is unique, according to Europol, because it combines ransomware with a worm function, meaning once one machine is infected, the entire internal network is scanned and other vulnerable machines are infected.,The attack therefore spread faster than previous, smaller-scale ransomware attacks.,Banks, trains and automobiles,Anti-virus experts Symantec said the majority of organisations affected were in Europe.,Europol said few banks in Europe had been affected, having learned through the \"painful experience of being the number one target of cyber crime\" the value of having the latest cyber security in place.,Russia said its banking system was among the victims of the attacks, along with the railway system, although it added that no problems were detected.,French carmaker Renault was forced to stop production at sites in France, Slovenia and Romania, while FedEx said it was \"implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible\".,A fifth of regional hospital associations in Britain's National Health Service were affected and several still had to cancel appointments on Monday, as doctors warned of delays as they cannot access medical records. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url":

The xa0previous target was 2015.The order covers the loading and unloading of passengers by buses and AUVs plying provincial routes entering Metro Manila as well as their efficient transfer to city buses and AUVs operating within Metro Manila. Once implemented the xa0franchises and routes of public utility buses will be revised particularly their end points. Provincial buses will only be allowed to go as far as their designated terminals when entering Metro Manila.These upcoming terminals are meant to dramatically improve traffic in Metro Manila especially in Edsa where most provincial buses have their current terminals. xa0The planA priority project of the Aquino government the ITS provides for the following facilities 1. North terminalThis is a facility that will have access to the North Luzon Expressway NLEx for xa0provincial buses and AUVs with Northern Luzon routes.These are the buses and AUVs originating from NLEx MacArthur Highway Mindanao Avenue Quirino Avenue or Commonwealth Avenue that will have to operate at this terminal instead of their current facilities within the capital proper.The Department of Transportation and Communication DOTC is responsible for developing this terminal.2.

than 150 countries, as Microsoft warned against stockpiling vulnerabilities like the one at the heart of the crisis.,European policing and security agencies said the fallout from a ransomware attack that has already crippled ,more than 200,000 computers, around the world could deepen as people return for another work week. ,The indiscriminate attack began Friday and struck banks, hospitals and government agencies, exploiting known vulnerabilities in older Microsoft computer operating systems.,US package delivery giant FedEx, European car factories, Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica, Britain's health service and Germany's Deutsche Bahn rail network were among those hit.,Europol executive director Rob Wainwright said the situation could worsen on Monday when workers return to their offices after the weekend and log on.,\"We've never seen anything like this,\" the head of the European Union's policing agency told Britain's ITV television, calling its reach

when people go to work and turn on their machines on Monday,\" he said.,The warning was echoed by Britain's National Cyber Security Centre: \"As a new working week begins it is likely, in the UK and elsewhere, that further cases of ransomware may come to light, possibly at a significant scale.\",'Ooops' message, $300 ransom ,The attack looks like this: images appear on victims' screens demanding payment of $300 (275 euros) in the virtual currency Bitcoin, saying: \"Ooops, your files have been encrypted!\",Payment is demanded within three days or the price is doubled, and if none is received within seven days the locked files will be deleted, according to the screen message.,Bitcoin, the world's most-used virtual currency, allows anonymous transactions via heavily encrypted codes.,Experts and governments alike warn against ceding to the demands and Wainwright said few victims so far had been paying up.,Security firm Digital Shadows said on Sunday that transactions totalling $32,000 had taken place through Bitcoin addresses used by the ransomware.,The culprits used a digital code believed to have been developed by the US National Security Agency -- and subsequently leaked as part of a document dump, according to researchers at the Moscow-based computer security firm Kaspersky Lab.,A hacking group called Shadow Brokers released the malware in April, claiming to have discovered the flaw from the NSA, Kaspersky said.,Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said in a blog post Sunday that it was in fact the NSA that developed the code being used in the attack.,He ,warned governments against stockpiling such vulnerabilities, and said instead they should report them to manufacturers \u2013 not sell, store or exploit them, lest they fall into the wrong hands.,\"An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,\" Smith wrote. ,\"The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake up call.\",The attack is unique, according to Europol, because it combines ransomware with a worm function, meaning once one machine is infected, the entire internal network is scanned and other vulnerable machines are infected.,The attack therefore spread faster than previous, smaller-scale ransomware attacks.,Banks, trains and automobiles ,Symantec said the majority of organisations affected were in Europe.,Europol's Wainwright said few banks in Europe had been affected, having learned through the \"painful experience of being the number one target of cyber crime\" the value of

as was the railway system.,French carmaker Renault was forced to stop production at sites in France, Slovenia and Romania, while FedEx said it was \"implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible\".,Germany's rail operator Deutsche Bahn said its station display panels were affected. ,England's National Health Service said 47 organizations providing care had been hit and on Sunday

It can affect \"at the same time individuals, businesses, and institutions,\" Amar Zendik, CEO security firm Mind Technologies, told Agence France-Presse.,How does it work?,Cyber pirates generally take control of computers by exploiting flaws in the internet.,That could happen when a user logs onto a web site that has been previously infected or opens an email that invites the user to click on a link or download an attachment.,In a few seconds, the malware can be implanted. And when it's installed, \"it can't be detected,\" Laurent Marechal, a cyber security expert at McAfee, told Agence France-Presse.,It's only afterwards that it \"downloads the 'payload', that is the viral charge,\" he said.,From then on the computer work station is blocked. \"Most often the user has to send an SMS\" \u2013 and pay up \u2013 \"in order to get the unblocking code,\"  says Marechal, adding that in certain complex cases, the virus can spread \"without any human intervention.\",Is it used frequently?,Yes.

{"content": "\nDespite her family\u2019s apprehensions, the ruling Liberal Party seems confident that Camarines Sur Representative Leni Robredo will say 'yes' to the VP offer\n,LP's VP? Admin standard-bearer Mar Roxas, President Benigno Aquino III, and Camarines Sur Representative Leni Robredo in Naga City. File photo by Malaca\u00f1ang ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 If the road to Manuel Roxas II\u2019s ,endorsement, and announcement of his 2016 plans was long and winding, the path to finding his running mate is just as storied.,More than a month after nabbing the endorsement of President Benigno Aquino III at Club Filipino, the neophyte senator he had been wooing to be his running mate announced her own presidential campaign.,Roxas\u2019 choices, at least publicly, were ,trimmed down to two,: another congressional newbie, partymate Camarines Sur Third District Representative Maria Leonor \u201cLeni\u201d Robredo, and Nacionalista Party (NP) stalwart Senator Alan Peter Cayetano.,The two met had separate meetings with Roxas and Aquino the week before the ruling LP was set to convene its National Directorate and National Executive Council (NECO), and things happened swiftly since. The NECO would make official the ruling party\u2019s slate for 2016 \u2013 its bet for president and vice president, as well as its senatorial slate.,The day before the NECO was supposed to meet, Cayetano announced on Tuesday, September 29, that he would be running for vice president, preferably alongside Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte.,Robredo, who in the past was quick to dismiss speculation of a planned vice presidential run, was now expressing openness to the idea. The neophyte lawmaker, however, said it was a decision she and her 3 children were not yet ready to make.,The Camarines Sur Representative, the widow of former interior secretary and Liberal Party (LP) stalwart Jesse Robredo, asked Roxas for more time to make a decision. And more time is exactly what Roxas gave to Robredo.,The morning of Cayetano\u2019s announcement, the LP made official what several sources had earlier told Rappler: the ruling party would not be making any announcements on September 30, as previously scheduled. It was the second time the LP has to reset the announcement of its 2016 slate.,On Wednesday, September 30, the LP will still convene its National Directorate and NECO, but only to comply with the Commission on Elections (Comelec)\u2019s calendar which set September 30 as the last day for parties to hold conventions.,The announcement is now set on October 5, Monday, at the historic Club Filipino, where Roxas \u201caccepted\u201d Aquino\u2019s endorsement in July. Come October 5, the LP is supposed to announce its vice presidential bet as well as its senatorial slate.,As far as LP officials are concerned, it's Robredo all the way. \",Malamang. Sabihin na lang natin na si Congresswoman Leni na ang kandidato natin sa pagkabise-presidente, (Most likely. Let's just say that Congresswoman Leni is our candidate for vice president),\" LP vice chairman and Senate President Franklin Drilon said on Wednesday. (READ: ,Leni Robredo is Mar's VP \u2013 Drilon,),\u2018It was always Leni\u2019,To observers, it would seem as though Robredo is merely the second option in the LP\u2019s 2016 plans. But those close to the Roxas campaign and the administration tell Rappler that Robredo has always been the ruling party\u2019s choice.,Robredo was thrust into politics in 2013, primarily to ensure an LP victory in her district against the politically entrenched Villafuertes, her late husband\u2019s relatives. Robredo beat Nelly Villafuerte in her district in 2013.,Prior to entering Congress, Robredo, a lawyer by profession, kept a mostly private life. While her husband introduced reforms in Naga City, Robredo opted to keep a low profile, working in a non-governmental organization which provided free legal assistance to the poor of Bicol province.,Jesse Robredo is now seen as the epitome of the Aquino\u2019s administration\u2019s \u201c,Daang Matuwid,,\u201d its catchphrase for its anti-corruption, good governance, and transparency platform. During his term as Naga City mayor, Jesse Robredo introduced new programs that drastically improved the city.,As interior secretary, Robredo brought along with him practices that proved effective in Naga City. Leni Robredo is seen as a continuation of those very same programs and ideals.,\u201c,Yung pagiging asawa ng asawa ko, meron mga ,considerations, na, bigger than ourselves,. Klaro 'yun sa amin, so 'yun ang nakakapahirap. Hindi ito yung tipong pwedeng ka lang humindi at tatalikod,,\u201d Robredo told Rappler.,(Being my husband\u2019s wife brings along with it considerations that are bigger than ourselves. That\u2019s clear to us so it makes the decision harder. It\u2019s not like I can just say no and turn my back on the offer.),But the Robredo children \u2013 Aika, Tricia, and Jillian \u2013 are against a vice presidential run. Robredo compares the process of mulling over the vice president offer to 2012, when the plane bearing Jesse Robredo and several others crashed off the coast of Masbate.,\u201cBeing in front of all this is really scary as far as I\u2019m concerned. My children are against it. ,Parang ,again,, noong pagkamatay ng asawa ko. 'Yung tanong pa rin naming mag-iina: bakit kailangan mangyari ang mangyari? Ngayon, 'yun rin ang tanong namin: Sa dinami-dami, bakit ako? Wala pa ring sagot eh,,\u201d she said during Rappler\u2019s Social Good Summit.,(It\u2019s like when my husband died. Our question then and now was why it has to happen. It\u2019s the same question now: Of all the choices out there, why me? I still haven't gotten an answer.),Aquino met with Robredo and her two older daughters last week, but the family still seems unconvinced. LP stalwarts and those close to the Roxas camp, however, are confident that the answer will eventually be \u201cyes.\u201d,Can \u2018Daang Matuwid\u2019 win an election?,Even before Cayetano announced his plans to run for vice president alongside Duterte \u2013 or even without the Davao mayor by his side \u2013 it was clear that LP stalwarts didn\u2019t have a \u201cplan B\u201d should Robredo turn down the offer.,It didn't help, of course, that Aquino himself was not sold on the idea of Cayetano as the LP's vice presidential bet. The NP senator is believed to have been part of a campaign to discredit Aquino during the 2010 elections. Cayetano is also against the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), the product of a peace deal between the Aquino administration and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). ,\",Of course, hindi natin makakaila na ang pangulo bilang author at talagang nagsimula ng Daang Matuwid ay talagang nirerespeto natin at matimbang ang kanyang pananaw, (We can't deny that the president, as the author and the one who started Daang Matuwid, we respect and value his views),\" said Roxas of Aquino's say on the LP's 2016 slate. ,While Poe was the politically astute choice \u2013 she was a survey front-runner and would have increased the chances of keeping an LP-led coalition intact \u2013 the decision to choose Robredo wasn\u2019t based on anything else save for \u201cconsistency\u201d with \u201c,Daang Matuwid,,\u201d according to LP executive vice president and Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya., ,\u201cIf you get somebody not consistent with ,Daang Matuwid,, instead of convincing people why ,Daang Matuwid, should continue, you\u2019ll have to explain why your running mate is ,Daang Matuwid, when people are saying: ,Daang Matuwid ba talaga 'yan, (Is he or she really, Daang Matuwid,)? ,Nauubos ang oras mo, (You waste your time) explaining your VP, instead of pushing your idea,\u201d Abaya told Rappler.,He added: \u201cImagine if Senator [Francis Escudero] was VP, ,eh ubos na 'yung oras mo, (it will take up all your time). You\u2019ll end up explaining things about your VP.\u201d,Unlike Poe or even Cayetano, Robredo\u2019s survey numbers are anything but promising.,Poe was still top choice for vice president in the latest nationwide preference surveys, getting 24% in a Pulse Asia survey. Her running mate, Escudero, is second with 23%. Cayetano is at fourth with 9%, while Robredo is a distant 10th with 3%. (READ: ,Poe leads nationwide; Roxas takes Visayas; Duterte, Mindanao,), ,Some surveys on voters' senatorial preferences have also shown Robredo squeak into the so-called \"Magic 12\" \u2013 the winners' circle \u2013 \u201cwithout even trying,\u201d noted Abaya.,Robredo had publicly said that she and her family are more comfortable with a possible senatorial bid than a vice presidential run.,Should Robredo say yes to running for the second-highest elective position, she\u2019ll be campaigning on the same promise of \u201c,Daang Matuwid,.\u201d,\u201cIf we see [Robredo] running, selected on the basis of the ideology of ,Daang Matuwid, and then she wins, then you see a new angle in Philippine politics,\u201d said Abaya. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

Repeat after me: Paris is possible!     ,All Paris photos provided by Ligaya Solera  ,Many people dream of going to Paris but are intimidated by the cost and complexity of turning this dream into reality. However, with a bit of luck and a whole lot of stinginess, it's entirely possible to go on a 7-day Paris trip for only P50,000. (More on that later!) (READ: ,A taste of Paris,),In this do-it-yourself Paris planning guide, I'll show you how to book your own flights and accommodations, list my top picks for what to see and do ,for free, in the City of Light, go through the basic steps in getting a Schengen visa, and give you budget travel tips. (READ: ,15 destinations around the world for Filipino travelers,),Paris is possible! ,HOW TO GET THERE,There are many ways to get to Paris, with various options for airlines, routes, and layover times.,If you have a specific date in mind for your trip, you can use ,Google Flights, to search for the cheapest route. Just enter your departure city (ex. Manila), your arrival city (Paris), your planned date of departure (ex. October 27, 2015), and your planned date of return (ex. November 2, 2015). ,Google Flights will give you a list of possible flights you can take, arranged by default from cheapest to most expensive (round-trip). The list will also show you the airlines involved, the total flight duration, and the number of layovers. (There are currently no direct flights from the Philippines to France.), , Screengrab from Google Flights ,Once you've chosen your outbound flight and your return flight, you will find at the bottom of the screen a link that will take you to the website of the airline you chose. ,There might be a little difference between the Google Flights price and the price in the airline's website, but this usually amounts to only a few dollars.,If your travel dates are flexible, you can use the left and right arrows of the drop-down calendar in Google Flights to scan for the cheapest prices.,Alternatively, you can use ,Skyscanner, to search for the cheapest flights within the next year. Just enter your city of departure and your desired destination, and choose \"Cheapest Month\" or \"Whole Year\" for the dates. , Screengrab from Skyscanner ,Click Search. From the results \u2013 which will show you departure, airline, and price options \u2013 click the one you like best.,Skyscanner will then show you the dates with the cheapest prices. You can then go to the airline's website and book the flights shown. Again, the actual price might differ from the Skyscanner price but usually only by a small difference. ,The cheapest Manila-Paris flights I've seen so far from Skyscanner cost P26,000, which is already very good deal considering the usual price of P40,000 up. If you're a budget traveler, airfare will be your biggest expense, so be patient in scouting for the best prices., ,WHERE TO STAY, ,Looking for accommodations in Paris can be overwhelming due to the huge number of choices. If you want straight-up recommendations, we were satisfied with our stays in the ,Grand Hotel du Loiret, (central location, near train station, can walk to Notre Dame and the Seine River) and the ,Hotel Terminus Lyon, (cheaper, right across the train station).,However, you might want to try doing your own searching so that you can find lodgings that are just right for you. (For advice on the best Parisian neighborhoods to stay in, check out Adventurous Kate's guide ,here,.) , Screengrab from Booking.com ,My go-to ,hotel, booking website is ,Booking.com, because I can sort the search results by price (lowest to highest, if I'm looking for the cheapest rooms) and then filter them by price range (ex. P4,900 and below per night), meals (ex. with breakfast), review score (ex. nothing below 7), and facility (ex. the all-important WiFi)., ,Hostels, are a good, cheaper option, especially if you're traveling alone. , Screengrab from hostelworld.com ,I usually book through ,HostelWorld.com,, which also lets me filter search results by price range, rating, property type, facilities, etc., and sort results by price from cheapest to most expensive.,Finally, you can also rent an apartment through ,Airbnb,. (READ: ,6 tips: Beginner's guide to Airbnb, an alternative to hotels,), ,WHAT TO SEE AND DO, ,There are many, many, many \u2013 and did I say many? \u2013 things you can see and do in Paris, depending on your interests and (of course) your budget. The following activities are ,free,:,HOW TO GET A VISA,Admittedly, ,getting a Schengen visa via the French embassy, is not going to be a walk in the park. You have to prove that you can afford your trip and that you're coming back to the Philippines. That said, you can increase your chances of getting a visa by making sure that your documents are complete. (READ: ,Applying for a visa?

Rodrigo Duterte receives a blessing from Pastor Apollo Quiboloy on the occasion of his birthday in March. Photo from Rody Duterte Facebook page ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Rodrigo Duterte admitted receiving valuable gifts from his good friend Pastor Apollo Quiboloy throughout the course of their \u201c30-year\u201d friendship, he said on Monday, May 2.,Quiboloy, the founder of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, has given him 3 properties in Woodridge Park, Ma-a, Davao City, he said, as guest at Quiboloy\u2019s late-night television show \u201cGive Us This Day.\u201d,\u201c,Noong mayor ako, binili ni Pastor, tatlong [property]\u2026Sabi niya, \u2018bilhan ko mga anak mo kasi pag nadisgrasya ka sa trabaho mo namatay ka\u2019\u2026Binigay na ang bahay sa Woodridge.

It\u2019s Pastor who paid.),In Duterte\u2019s 2015 Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Networth (SALN), he declared 3 lots in Ma-a, supposedly acquired from 1997 to 1998. Could this be the lots from Quiboloy? (READ: ,Quiboloy predicts landslide win for Duterte,),The wealthy pastor also bequeathed to Duterte a lot in Royal Pines, in Matina, Davao City. A lot in Matina is declared in his 2015 SALN and previous SALNs., ,Cars from Quiboloy,Quiboloy also apparently gave Duterte a Nissan Safari and Ford Expedition years ago. Duterte tried to return the Expedition but said his daughter, Sara, wanted to keep it., ,\u201c,Binalik ko. Tapos ito si Inday nagwala kasi gusto niya. Eh saan ka magkuha ng pang-gasolina? Para kang buang diyan., (I returned it. Then Inday went crazy because she wanted it. Where will you get money for gas? You\u2019re like a fool),\u201d said Duterte.,The Davao City mayor described Quiboloy as so generous that anytime he would buy something, he was sure to buy two of it so he could give one to Duterte.,\u201c,Everytime si Pastor magbili, dalawa yan. Ang isa sa akin diyan, sigurado, (Every time Pastor buys, he gets two. One is mine, for sure),\u201d he said., ,In the United States, Duterte said Quiboloy even offered to pay for the mayor\u2019s appointment with a famous neurosurgeon, Dr Martin Cooper, in order for something to be done about his perpetually sweaty hands.,Duterte apparently will continue accepting favors from Quiboloy if he is elected president. The pastor has offered his private jet for Duterte\u2019s use., ,\u201c,Sabi ko, I\u2019ll just use it kasi kung manalo ako, dito ako matulog sa Davao araw-araw.

{"content": "\nIn a place where a 300-year-old building is considered new, time has a different meaning    , ,I spent 7 glorious, delicious days in Paris last Holy Week because Germany won the World Cup '14. ,Let me explain. I know next to nothing about football, but at the start of last year's World Cup, I made a bet with my Spanish husband \u2013 a huge football fan \u2013  that Germany would win. With Spain eliminated so early, he was rooting for Argentina and Lionel Messi, the best player in the world for him and all FC Barcelona fans.,To cut the long story short \u2013 I won the bet, he stood by his word and (after much grumbling and my gloating) booked flights to Paris. If Argentina had won, our Holy Week would have been in Russia on board the Trans Siberian train, where we would have no doubt frozen to death. Thank goodness for that goal by Mario Gotze.,So after much anticipation and careful planning of my trip wardrobe, we arrived in Paris the day before Palm ,Sunday,, in the very last days of winter, not quite spring yet. ,On the train to our hotel in Les Halles, I excitedly plotted out activities for the next few days, wishing we had more than just a week to see everything, but figured that if we were able to prioritize and get the must-sees like the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame and Versailles out of the way early on, we could then relax and enjoy the company of my in-laws, who were flying in from Spain to join us for a few days.,The Eiffel Tower ,But disaster struck just minutes after we got to our hotel. I injured my toe in the shower and was bleeding, but no way was I going to let something as stupid as that throw a wrench into my plans. Despite the pain, I limped around, eagerly taking in the sights, sounds and energy of Paris. My eyes hungrily devoured the sight of everything and everyone walking by the small cafe on St. Honor\u00e9 where we had our first meal \u2013 savory crepes, which I also very quickly devoured. ,I couldn't believe I was finally there! I was delighted to discover that because I'm such a foodie, I knew enough French food words to make sense of any menu, even if it was completely in French. ,One of the things people have told me to expect in Paris was that the locals would be snooty, bordering on rude, and refuse to speak English. Again, I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was none of that. Everywhere we went, people were helpful and did their best to understand what I was asking them. ,Day 2 was museum day. We visited the Centre Pompidou for modern art and after a sumptuous lunch, proceeded to the Louvre, where my first stop was to check out the ancient Egyptian art, with which I've always been strangely obsessed, even tattooing the symbol of Ra on my lower back. My eyes moistened a few times as the relics seemed to transport me back to the time of the pharaohs.,The Louvre ,Mona Lisa ,By the time my in-laws were scheduled to arrive, I however felt much more like the Hunchback of Notre Dame than Angelina, hobbling around with my toe swollen and red like a tomato. The wound never had a chance to heal, and it got infected from all the walking. I had to buy a pair of sneakers, give up wearing boots and pretty much all sense of fashion. Besides, apparently it rains almost daily in Paris that time of year, so I was covered in the same boring rain coat throughout. ,Opera National de Paris ,Dining in France, while admittedly quite expensive, is worth every penny, or in this case, cent. We never went anywhere fancy, and yet the quality of the food was always top-notch. Not only do the French know how to cook, they never use anything other than the best of ingredients. You can taste the love they put into their food. ,If we didn't walk so much, we would have gotten fat. But every day right after breakfast, we set out on foot, hardly ever riding a cab or train, except when we went 30 minutes outside of the city to see the Palace of Versailles. We suffered in line for an hour and a half in the bitter cold, but when we finally got inside, it was so worth the wait. Every square inch of the palace was a sight to behold. I stopped to listen to some of the tour guides, but mostly I just drank everything in. ,Palace of Versailles ,Montmartre ,Musee D'Orsay ,All photos provided by Rachel Alejandro,Rachel ,Alejandro, is a singer-actress, entrepreneur and best-selling co-author of The Sexy Chef Cookbook.

{"content": "\nThe Philippine panel divulges more details of the military-to-miitary agreement with the US as the treaty allies reach final stages on negotiations    ,RESHUFFLE: Panel chairman Defense Undersecretary Pio Lorenzo Batino introduces new panel members ambassadors Eduardo Malaya and Lourdes Yparraguirre. Rappler photo,MANILA, Philippines (Updated) \u2013 The US panel negotiating a military-to-military agreement granted the Philippines access to facilities it will build inside our military bases, according to Philippine panel chairman Pio Lorenzo Batino. ,\"It would be safe to say that there is already a consensus for language to be included that would assure access by Philippine authorities over locations provided to the US troops,\" Batino told reporters in a briefing on Friday, March 14. ,While the Philippine panel allowed the US to construct facilities inside military bases, the US wanted to limit the access of Filipino troops to these facilities. Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said this led to an , ,\"impasse, in the talks last year. , ,The panels hurdled the impasse. They are now in the final stages of negotiations for an agreement that will make way for increased presence of American troops in the Philippines and will allow them to access and build facilities in military bases here.,The treaty allies have agreed on several contentious issues including the scope of access the Filipino troops will be given to facilities the Americans will build and the duration of the agreement. ,\"If the negotiations are successfully concluded and that happens before the arrival of President [Barack] Obama, we'll be happy of course,\" Philippine Ambassador to Austria Lourdes Yparaguirre, ,a new member of the panel,, told reporters in a briefing on Friday, March 14. ,The US president is scheduled to visit the Philippines in April. Talk is rife that the agreement will be signed during his visit, but panel members maintain they are pressured to finalize the agreement before his visit. ,The Philippines has presented the US a ,\"full draft text\", of the agreement. The 2 panels will hold another round of negotiations in Manila on March 25, before Obama's visit.,Here are the details of the agreement so far, according to the panel's briefing on Friday.,1. Philippines will have access to facilities the US will build ,Panel chairman Defense Undersecretary Pio Lorenzo Batino guaranteed that mutual access to facilities that the US will be allowed to build inside our military bases. ,\"It would be safe to say that there is already a consensus for language to be included that would assure a given, which is access by Philippine authorities over locations provided to the US troops, which would be within AFP facilities. I think the point that we have to focus on is that this concern for the Philippines government had already been sufficiently addressed during the negotiations,\" said Batino during the briefing. ,Malaya explained that \"Philippine authorities\" means Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin or officials he will designate. ,\"Technically the term is 'duly designated Philippine authorities.' Generally, that would be the Secretary of National Defense or whoever he designates to exercise that right,\" M,alaya said in a followup interview after the panel briefing.,What is being discussed, said Malaya, is the how the two countries will share responsibilities with respect to security. \"As a concept, access is assured. The right of the base commander to have access to specic areas will be shared with them. It has already been agreed in principle by both panels,\" he said. ,\"We are discussing some operational safety and security requirements with respect to the exercise of access by the base commander,\" Malaya added.,2. It is not a base within a base,There have been concerns about access because of previous incidents where Americans limited the access of Filipino troops to areas they were provided.,\"The facilities would be used to obtain mutual benefits for the US armed forces and the Philippine armed forces. In this agreement, and also in the implementation of this agreement, it would be a requirement that the presense of US troops would be temporary. With these characteristics we can say that this wont be a base within a base,\" Batino explained.,3. Privacy of US troops will be respected ,The agreement is geared toward \"greater information sharing.\" Batino said that is an essential part of the agreement. ,Reporters pressed the panel members on the scope of cooperation. Is there exclusivity to communications and intelligence, for example?,However, Batino said there is also a need to respect the privacy of the Americans. He did not elaborate.,3. No agreement yet if deal will be a treaty or executive agreement,The Philippine panel has taken the direction of an executive agreement, meaning it will not need the ratification of the Philippine Senate. ,US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg revealed in February that the panels are still discussing the options. ,Malaya said the US wants to make sure that the agreement is legally binding \u2013 , an executive agreement is, ,the Philippine panel explained. ,Still, Batino said it will not be the panels who will decide if it will be a treaty or an executive agreement. ,\"My personal take is that we cannot agree on a legal question. We are negotiating provisions and, as of the latest draft, what we can say is that, at least my belief is that, these provisions partake of the implementing nature of the Mutual Defense Treaty and the Visiting Forces Agreement. Based on this, therefore, we will not need the Senate concurrence,\" Batino said. ,3. Duration of agreement is less than 20 years,Batino said the two panels have agreed on how long the US will be given temporary access to Philippine military bases. But he refused to provide details because of the fluidity of the negotiations. ,Bilateral military agreements with the US typically last 20 years, but the panel said the Philippines is looking at a much shorter timeframe. \"Maybe the most we can say is it's shorter than 20 years,\" said Malaya. ,4. Boarding of ships was not discussed,The boarding of American ships by Philippine authories was not discussed. ,\"The concentration of this agreement is the temporary access to be provided by the Philippine government to the US forces. We're concentrating on locations here. Boarding of ships, though related, is not directly under the coverage of this agreement,\" explained Batino. ,But it may be taken up later on, he said, through \"implementing arrangements or even through operational mechanisms.\",5. VFA takes care of 'erring' American soldiers,The panels also did not discuss matters of custody and jurisdiction with regard to \"erring\" American troops. This remains within the coverage of the Visiting Forces Agreement.,\"Jurisdiction over erring personnel will be governed by the VFA. What we are talking about here is allowing them access to specific areas, to locations, and the right of Philippine authorities through the base commander or other designated authorities have already been agreed upon,\" Malaya said. ,Escalating tension,The Philippines has sought the assistance of the US, a treaty ally, against the backdrop of rising tension with China over maritime disputes in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea).,The Philippine and the US are treaty allies with a long history of cooperation. The US used to have bases in the Philippines that allowed the presence of tens of thousands of US troops here. But the Senate voted in 1991 not to renew the treaty. They were able to return in 1999, following the approval of the Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows the temporary presence of US troops in the country.,Batino gave assurances that the new agreement is consistent with the Philippine Constitution as well as \"mindfulness of the country's historical experiences.\",Tension continues to escalate as the Philippines accused the Chinese coast guard of using water cannons against Filipino fishermen in January in an attempt to drive them away from the Panatag Shoal (Scarborough). It is a rocky sandbar located off the coast of Zambales that is now practically occupied by the Chinese coast guard. (READ: ,PH protests China 'water cannon' incident,),China, for its part, also accused the Philippines of \"constructing\" in Ayungin Shoal located off Palawan. Chinese coast guard recently blocked civilian ships commissioned by the Philippine Navy to bring food and water to troops manning a grounded warship that has served as a Marines detachment. (,READ: China on Ayungin: PH broke its promise,),China is making its claim based on a 9-dash-line map, which the US categorically said it does not recognize.

There's a lot you need to consider \u2013 you won't have a housekeeper, amenities aren't certain \u2013 but there are upsides, too.

I had to stop over Milan to comply with visa Schengen requirements (my visa was granted by the Italian Embassy so I either had to make Italy my first stop or stay there the longest) and was set to be in Paris for about a week. (READ:, Applying for a visa? Keep these 5 tips in mind,),The hotel prices in Milan spike for weekend stays and it was difficult to find a centrally located hotel room in Paris for less than $100, so I thought it would be the perfect time to try out Airbnb, both as an experiment and as cost effective option. ,In Milan, I was hosted by Domenico and Patrizia, an Italian couple who rented out their ,studio apartment in Gorla, Milan,, and their studio apartment was wonderful!,It was designed by the couple\u2019s son, who is an architect who made sure that everything was functional, funky and cozy all at the same time. ,HOSTS AS FRIENDS.

They had guidebooks and printed out maps of the area that contained important information about the nearest metro, places of interest and places to eat.,I did not realize that I did not do much research on Milan because it was really just going to be a pit stop for me, but the travel materials they had made it impossible for me not to want to go out and explore Milan. ,Best of all, they helped me map out how long it would take me to get to the airport to catch my early morning flight to Paris and even called a cab for me to make sure I got to the train station without any glitches. That was a big help since English is not widely spoken in Milan. ,Before I left, we took a selfie and Domenico told me, \u201cWhen you are in Italy, this will be your home.\u201d To a tired and jetlagged traveler, that was the best send-off. ,My apartment in Paris was a small,, cozy studio, located just 3 blocks away from the metro and 5 minutes away from the Eiffel Tower. The location was excellent. The bed was a sofabed called a \u201cclick clack\u201d because you just unfold it, but it was comfortable enough. ,Overall, I loved my Airbnb experience and would try it again the next time I travel. I thought that it would be a better option to try in cities like Europe where hotel rooms are usually smaller, older and very expensive, but a couple of friends have tried it out in other countries and were all satisfied. ,My friend, Andrea, who has tried Airbnb on different trips told me, \u201cEach country has different cultural practices that may not be written in the listing. My experience has been somewhat amusing! For instance, in Japan (& Scandinavia), duvets are per person, even on a king bed. In Copenhagen, the telephone shower was attached to the sink faucet! I think these all add to the experience as a traveler.\u201d ,Andrea has since ,put up her own properties ,in Manila for listing on Airbnb. ,Before you try out Airbnb, here are some things you should know and consider., READ: ,From hostels to capsule rooms: 7 places you can stay in Manila,1. There are various options to suit your budget,There are generally two types of accommodations to suit your traveling style and budget: private room, entire home or apartment.,For those traveling in groups or as a family, renting an entire apartment is more cost effective than renting out different hotel rooms. Be sure to check how many guests are allowed for the rate per night that is advertised.,Hosts will usually charge an extra fee for every guest in excess of what is allowed and will also stipulate a maximum number of guests.,If you\u2019re renting a private room, if you are squeamish about bathroom arrangements, make sure to check if the room has its own bathroom.,2. You get a local feel with home amenities, ,You get to live like a local because listings are private residences owned by locals. You also get home amenities like a kitchen so you can cook if you feel like staying in. ,A bonus for me was the washing machine in my apartment in Milan. For my transit stay there, I had been on the road for more than 10 days. It was a relief to get to wash my clothes and dry them on the apartment\u2019s heater.,It\u2019s safe: There are security checks to ensure the safety of both the guest and the host,Both hosts and guests need to register on Airbnb before they can post a listing or make a booking. Identification is verified through your email address, social media account (Facebook) and offline verification such as sending a passport so you\u2019re sure that the person \u2013 both hosting and booking \u2013 are real people.  ,3. Know that it\u2019s not a hotel, ,LIVE LIKE A LOCAL. Remember, this isn't a hotel, so don't expect housekeeping or free breakfasts,Don\u2019t expect hotel service like a concierge or an everyday housekeeping service. You are living like a local and will have to clean up after yourself. Some guests offer a cleaning service after a certain number days for long staying guests so be sure to check with your host.,There\u2019s no 24-hour check in like in a hotel so you will have to communicate with your host about arrival time (including delayed flights and such) and getting directions to finding the apartment. ,It can get pretty costly on SMS, but you can take advantage of the Airbnb app which will allow you to communicate with your host via instant messaging. ,Tip:, Once you arrive, take advantage of the complimentary WiFi in the airport to keep your host updated about the status of your arrival and save on SMS fees. ,4. All listings are different \u2013 so what are your priorities?, ,Read the list of inclusions and amenities carefully. There\u2019s an easy to read checklist on each listing, so check what is important or a non-negotiable for you like a WiFi connection, or how near the place is to the public transportation.,Be sure to watch for other things, like if the apartment is located on a higher floor and if there is an available elevator in the building.,5. Booking is not always instant,Some listings offer instant booking (there\u2019s a violator on the picture of the listing to make sure you know that this is an instant booking) where you can book and reserve at the same time as you would in a hotel.,For other listings, you will have to reserve and wait for your host to accept your reservation. Your host will have 24 hours to accept or reject your booking. ,Payment is done via credit card, so you do not have to exchange cash with your host. Airbnb will add a booking fee to your booking which will show up in your final total before you book. ,Your credit card will only be charged 24 hours after check in to give you time to  change your mind just in case. ,Be sure to check on your host\u2019s cancellation policy before booking as this may vary from each guest.,READ THE REVIEWS. Hosts can review the guests, too. Screengrab from AirBnb,6. Read the reviews,As you would with any online booking, read the reviews very carefully. Guests get to review both publicly and privately. Public reviews will appear on the reviews section of the listing and private reviews will be accessible only to Airbnb. ,Get a feel of what the apartment and host are like by reading the reviews; it will be a major factor in deciding on which listing to book. ,And the reviews go both ways, the hosts get to review the guests, too. I didn\u2019t know this until I got a message on my Airbnb app showing the reviews from both Domenico and Patrizia and Milene.,It\u2019s a great, discreet and respectful way of ensuring that the hosts make the guest feel at home and the guests in turn repay their hospitality with gratitude \u2013 and a tidied up apartment before leaving. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Ana P.

{"content": "\nWhat are the advantages of either Leni Robredo or Alan Peter Cayetano for Mar Roxas?\n,MAR'S VP? File photos from Rappler (Rep Leni Robredo), DILG (Mar Roxas), and Senator Allan Cayetano's official website  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It\u2019s down to two.,Two months after getting President Benigno Aquino III\u2019s ,endorsement, for the 2016 national elections and with a little over two weeks left before the filing of candidacies, the Liberal Party (LP) is set to announce its vice presidential bet on Wednesday, September 30, at Club Filipino.,The LP\u2019s list has been trimmed down to 2: the party's own Camarines Representative Maria Leonor \u201cLeni\u201d Robredo and the Nacionalista Party's (NP) Senator Alan Peter Cayetano.,Robredo continues to be reluctant to take on the challenge, according to two sources close to her. Cayetano, on the other hand, is all set for a vice presidential run. ,This situation puts Aquino and Roxas in a tough situation, because the President prefers Robredo over Cayetano.,Both Robredo and Cayetano have been in meetings with Aquino and Roxas last week.,Since his declaration, Roxas has been consistent with his criteria for a running mate: someone who is \u201cto the bones\u201d a believer in \u201c,Daang Matuwid, (Straight Path),\u201d the administration\u2019s tagline for its anti-corruption, good governance, and transparency platform.,\u201c,Daang Matuwid, will always be the measure [when choosing a vice president],\u201d LP executive vice president and Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya told Rappler in a Wednesday, September 23 interview.,\u201c,Daang Matuwid,\u201d is at the center of Roxas and the LP\u2019s 2016 campaign. The ruling party and its allies, in sorties and various programs, make it a point to highlight the gains of the Aquino administration, supposedly thanks to \u201cDaang Matuwid.\u201d,Roxas is packaged as the only candidate who can best continue the current administration\u2019s gains and programs. At the time Roxas got Aquino\u2019s endorsement, his numbers were not encouraging.,At its lowest, Roxas got 4 percentage points in early presidential preference surveys.,Poe then was leading preference surveys, taking over Vice President Jejomar Binay, who for months has tried to defend himself from corruption allegations. The administration bet\u2019s numbers have since risen in the latest presidential preference surveys, although he still trails Poe and Binay.,As the supposed \u201c,underdog,\u201d of the 2016 presidential elections, what are the advantages of either Robredo or Cayetano for Roxas?,LP'S CHOICE. Mar Roxas, President Benigno Aquino III and Rep Leni Robredo during the death anniversary of the late Jesse Robredo in Naga City. File photo by Joseph Vidal/Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau ,LENI ROBREDO,Robredo is a neophyte legislator representing the 3rd district of Camarines Sur, and is the provincial chairman of the Liberal Party.,The widow of former interior secretary and Naga City Mayor Jesse Robredo, the congresswoman has always preferred non-political tasks. \u201cI kept a low profile in my husbands 21 years as a public official. It was the life I chose. It was my decision,\u201d said Robredo of her life before the plane her husband was on crashed off the coast of Masbate in 2012.,In 2013, Robredo ran for the congressional post she holds now, primarily to make sure the district would not be under the control of the politically entrenched Villafuertes.,According to sources privy to discussions, Robredo has always been the top choice of many LP and administration allies, even when Aquino and Roxas were still wooing Poe to run for vice president.,For the LP, Robredo is the \u201cepitome\u201d of \u201c,Daang Matuwid,.\u201d Her late husband himself was an LP stalwart and is remembered for the reforms be started in Naga and brought into the powerful Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).,A Robredo candidacy may also take away Bicol votes from Poe\u2019s running mate, Senator Francis Escudero who hails from Sorsogon. Geopolitics, however, wasn\u2019t a factor at all in picking Robredo, said Abaya.,\u201cIf you cite some communications expert [Robredo] is probably is as consistent and as pure as can be [when it comes to ,Daang Matuwid,],\u201d said Abaya of Robredo.,Her numbers \u2013 at least for the VP post \u2013 aren\u2019t very encouraging either. In the Social Weather Stations (SWS)\u2019s third quarter survey on vice presidential bets, Robredo got 3 percentage points.,Escudero was second with 20 percentage points while Poe led with 27 percentage points.,That doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem for the LP. \u201cWe know the reality, you\u2019re up against Chiz [Escudero] \u2013 ,beterano, kilala, and all that \u2013 ,pero tingin ko, (He\u2019s a veteran, everyone knows him. But I think), you have to be consistent with Daang Matuwid,\u201d said Abaya.,There is one big problem for the LP, though.,'The answer is no',Robredo is anything but sold on the idea of running for vice president. Even before the slot was ,formally offered, to her by the LP, she has been vocal about ,not wanting to run, for the second-highest elective post in the country.,\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared for something as big as this one. Over the past few days I was asked to at least just be open to the idea. I was telling everyone if that I would be cerebral about it, the ,answer is really no,,\u201d Robredo said on Saturday, September 26, during a question-and-answer at the Rappler Social Good Summit.,Aside from this, there are a handful of other things holding Robredo back. There\u2019s the district she might leave behind but more importantly, her family of 3.,LIFELINE NEEDED? Leni Robredo posts and old photo of her husband, the late Jesse Robredo, as the LP finalizes its 2016 line-up. ,\u201c,Para madali lang sabihin yung \u2018Bayan Bago Sarili\u2019 pero nanay kasi ako eh, hindi lang ako nanay, nanay at tatay ako ng mga anak ko. At the end of the day, kailangan ko yung blessings nila. hindi pwede na tatalon lang ako na hindi rin maluwag sa kalooban,,\u201d she told Rappler in a chance interview.,(It\u2019s easy to say \u2018Country Before Self\u2019 but I\u2019m a mother. I\u2019m not just a mother, but a mother and father to my children. At the end of the day, I need their blessings. I cannot just jump into something when theirs are heavy hearts.),It\u2019s been a difficult few weeks for Robredo, who says that even \u201cno\u201d would be the easier answer, being Jesse\u2019s widow has its responsibilities.,\u201c,Hindi naman natin mapipikit yung mata sa ibang considerations, lalo na kasi asawa ako ng asawa ko, (I cannot just close my eyes to other considerations, especially because I\u2019m my husband\u2019s wife),\u201d she said.,Robredo and her two older daughters ,met, with Aquino, Roxas, and Social Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman last week to \u201cclear the air\u201d after the VP offer. Although they have been mum about the details of the meeting, sources close to Robredo said that she asked for up to September 30 to make the decision.,The LP national executive committee convention, which was originally set on Monday, September 28, was later moved to September 30. Was it to accommodate Robredo\u2019s request?,Those in the Roxas camp \u2013 Abaya included \u2013 are still hoping the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d,On Sunday evening, September 27, Robredo posted an old photo of her and Jesse Robredo. \u201cReposting because this I desperately need,\u201d read the post.,The answer should come sooner than later. \",Hindi naman pwede na ibitin namin hanggang sa last minute na kung no rin naman yung sagot, mawawalan sila ng options, (I can't make them wait until the last minute if the answer is no because the LP will run out of options),\" said Robredo of the decision she has to make. ,FALLBACK? Senator Alan Peter Cayetano at work. File photo from Senate PRIB ,ALAN PETER CAYETANO,Cayetano has made no secret his plans to run for higher office \u2013 for president, if the conditions were right. Early 2014, Cayetano had already formed a team for a possible presidential run.,But the numbers weren\u2019t on his side. Early presidential preference surveys saw him post numbers even lower than Roxas\u2019.,In the latest SWS vice presidential preference survey, Cayetano got 5 percentage points, a distant sixth behind Poe, Escudero, Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, Senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and former president and Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada.,Cayetano bagged his second Senate term in 2013, running under the administration ticket \u201cTeam PNoy.\u201d During the mid-term elections, he got 17.4 million votes, placing him 3rd in the list of Senate winners then.,Escudero trailed him, but only by about 100,000 votes.,Cayetano\u2019s biggest backer, according to sources, is a powerful bloc within the Roxas camp that includes businessmen from the mining sector. Those same people are convinced that despite Escudero\u2019s lead in early preference surveys, Cayetano has what it takes to beat him.,The senator\u2019s brand of no-holds-barred \u201cexposes,\u201d the source told Rappler, is also a plus should push-come-to-shove in the campaign.,But it\u2019s that same fire for \u201cexposes\u201d that\u2019s a huge minus for Cayetano.,Sources close to the administration told Rappler a few weeks ago that Aquino has yet to forget Cayetano\u2019s tirades against him during the 2010 elections, when he was supposedly among those who orchestrated the release of a fake psychiatric report which alleged Aquino had mental issues. Cayetano then was supposed NP bet and former Senate President Manuel Villar\u2019s candidacy.,Burying the hatchet?,A lot of things have happened since.,The NP joined a broad coalition led by the LP, and Cayetano was part of the administration's senatorial slate in 2013. (READ: ,Cayetano the 2nd option for Roxas?,),\u201c,Magkakilala naman kami ni Sen Allan. He was my deputy majority leader noong majority leader ako sa House of Representatives. Magkasama kami sa Senado. In fact, siguro, halos walo sa sampu na ipinaglaban ni Pangulong PNoy, anti-GMA, anti-corruption, etc, kasama naman po si Senator Alan,,\u201d Roxas said of Cayetano during a Thursday, September 24 chance interview with reporters.,(Senator Alan and I know each other. He was my deputy majority leader when I was majority leader in the House of Representatives. We worked together in the Senate. In fact, maybe in 8 out of 10 things that President Aquino fought for \u2013 anti-GMA, anti-corruption \u2013 Senator Allan was with us.),Aquino\u2019s September 23 meeting with Cayetano, which lasted for over 2 hours, could also mean that the hatchet has been buried.,When asked about the meeting between the President and Cayetano, Roxas was unable to give details. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they talked about but obviously the President\u2019s view is very important in this decision,\u201d he said.,But there\u2019s another issue that\u2019s holding the President back from the thought of a Roxas-Cayetano ticket, sources pointed out to Rappler.,Cayetano is among those who are against the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), the result of a long-awaited peace deal signed between the Aquino administration and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).,Asked about Cayetano\u2019s stand on the controversial BBL, Roxas said \u201cmaybe those are the one or two\u201d issues where the administration and Cayetano differed. Pressed on whether this was a deal breaker for a potential tandem, Roxas said: \u201cThat\u2019s not for me to say.\u201d,Cayetano had harsh words for the MILF in the aftermath of the deadly Mamasapano clash, figuring in heated and emotional exchanges with Peace Process Adviser Secretary ,Teresita Quintos Deles, and ARMM Governor ,Mujiv Hataman,.  ,The politics of addition also supports a possible Roxas-Cayetano tandem.,Bringing Cayetano in could also help strengthen chances of the NP staying in the LP-led coalition.,But NP has members eyeing highest posts, prompting one of its leaders to say the party should just declare a \u201c,free zone,\u201d \u2013 meaning its members should be free to choose their own presidential bet.,Aside from Cayetano, Senators Ferdinand Marcos Jr and Antonio Trillanes IV have plans of running for higher office. Marcos is being wooed by Binay to be his running mate, while Trillanes said he is running for vice president.,A vice presidential run for Cayetano is relatively risk-free for the senator. Should he lose, he can always return to the Senate since his term does not expire until 2019. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

If you want a break from urban life, then head for the coast and the beachside town of Sihanoukville, from there another 30 minutes to 1 hour boat ride to this soon-to-be-famous island of Koh Rong.,It doesn\u2019t have the best beaches in comparison with Thailand and the Philippines, but it\u2019s a small piece of paradise that\u2019s not too crowded, and there is another even more remote island just nearby: Koh Rong Saloem.,There is little to do here except relax, eat fresh fish, walk on perfect beaches and take nightly midnight swims with glow-in-the-dark plankton.

Remember though, you are required to get an entry permit from the Tourism office in Darjeeling (aside from your Indian tourist visa). From here you can visit high-altitude lakes and experience once-in-a-lifetime mountain trekking. ,This is completely a different side of India where you will find mixed cultures and traditions of Nepalese, Bhutanese and Tibetans all in one region.

And if you\u2019re already in Peru, you no doubt want to head straight to Cuzco for Machu Picchu, but don\u2019t forget to head to the highest navigable lake in the world, Lake Titicaca in Puno.,Half of Lake Titicaca sits within the Peruvian boundary, with the other half being part of Bolivia. From Puno you can take lake tours to a series of floating islands where local Peruvians live and work in the same way they have for generations.,If you have time, travel from Puno into Bolivia to see the Bolivian side of the lake, which is far more tranquil and less developed. ,Arequipa, Peru, , ,Lima, Cuzco and Machu Picchu are major highlights for anyone visiting Peru, but many miss out on this incredible \u2018White City\u2019 in the South of Peru. It\u2019s called the White City due to the white volcanic stone that most of the old city is constructed from.,Standing in the old Plaza de Armas, you\u2019ll almost feel like you\u2019re in Vigan!

La Paz, Bolivia is another overnight bus (17 hours) away from Cuzco and you can easily cross the border by land. La Paz is the highest Capital City in the world and is almost like a time warp of Latin American and indigenous cultures, with 1950s public buses, art deco buildings and even some historic architecture designed by Gustave Eiffel, the engineer behind the Eiffel Tower!,From the capital you can head straight to the incredible Uyuni Salt Flats for a 3-day 4-wheel-drive adventure. The salt flats are a dried lake of salt which when combined with seasonal rainfall, transform into a pristine liquid mirror!

It remains a corner of tranquility and a natural habitat to several types of monkeys, sloths, racoons. sea turtles, coral species and even rare species of birds which have recently been reintroduced to area, like magnificent Scarlet Macaws.,The small town of Manuel Antonio is situated right outside the national park itself, with several stunning beaches between the park gates and the nearby town of Quepos, where you\u2019ll find a marina packed with sport fishing boats and even a luxury super yacht or two.,For adventure junkies, there are loads thrill-filled adventure sports to choose from, like surfing, canyoning, quad biking, zip-lining and much more!

While the Pasig RTC sided with Taguig, the appeals court reversed the lower court.,The CA declared constitutional and valid PP 2475 and PP 518.,A Manila Bulletin report, said the CA corrected the lower court\u2019s position that the Marcos and Aquino proclamations altered the boundaries between the two localities when they transferred parts of Taguig to Makati.,In fact, the CA said, these proclamations were only confirming the jurisdiction of Makati.,Delay in showing interest,The appeals court cited the fact that since 1970, the residents of the 7 barangays within the military camp have been registered as Makati voters.,The court also took Taguig to task for not showing interest in the boundary claims early enough.

AFP/Noel Celis,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 One day in September, a group of Taclobanons and environmentalists foresaw that a super typhoon named Hagibis would wreak havoc in their city in year 2020.,The prediction was for a scenario-building exercise with Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Philippines to help the city assess its disaster-preparedness.,Today, Tacloban is a wasteland where dead bodies rot in open air and survivors struggle to live. Almost all homes and structures are obliterated. Food and water are in scarce supply. Taclobanons never expected the storm to come 7 years early. (READ: ,Tacloban devastated; at least 100 dead,),There are many reasons why Tacloban was among the cities worst-hit by nightmare-turned-reality Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). Some of these reasons were predicted by the study that resulted from the scenario-building exercises in Tacloban.,The city's large population, high level of urbanization, location and weak coastal areas all contributed to Tacloban's unique vulnerability, revealed the study.,Entitled \"Business Risk Assessment and the Management of Climate Impacts,\" the study evaluates the vulnerabilities of select Philippine cities to the impacts of climate change which includes extreme weather events like storms.,Tacloban is one of 12 cities assessed by WWF-Philippines and other experts from 2011 to 2013.

Then we added inputs from local stakeholders through the scenario-building exercise,\" he explained.,The local stakeholders were composed of local government officials, the private sector, academe and non-government organizations.,1. Location,Geohazard maps of Tacloban already showed how exposed the city was to danger.,\"If you look at the geohazard map of Tacloban, only a small part is not red. Red meaning highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The LGU saw that already,\" said Hinay.,Tacloban is bound on the east and south by water leading to Leyte Gulf and the Pacific Ocean. In the north and the west, it is bound by mountains. Thus, the city was trapped. In the face of the ,15-foot-high storm surge, that submerged its coastal communities, Taclobanons could not evacuate further than the mountains.,The same wall blocking their path is a danger spot in itself. Mountains often mean landslides, especially when the winds and rain were as strong as Yolanda's.,2. Land subsidence,Further making Tacloban vulnerable to flooding caused by storm surge is the fact that much of it is below sea level, said Hinay. In many places, there were also cases of land subsidence in which \"sea water enters the soil, slowly eating away the coastal areas,\" explained Hinay.,Land subsidence also happens when humans draw water from the soil for drinking, bathing and other uses. The extraction of water creates spaces between soil particles. When the roof over these spaces cannot support all the intact soil above it, it collapses thereby lowering the level of soil on the surface.,Subsidence lowers the land surface a couple of centimeters every year. The lower the land goes, the more likely it will be inundated when sea levels rise or flooding occurs. Eventually, the land will become so low that flooding will happen even during high tide.,3. Population, urbanization,Tacloban is Eastern Visayas' migratory city, said Hinay.,\"Vast lands and good weather create a migratory sink. If you have really good weather and plenty of lands, people will go to your land regardless of the situation. For example in Zamboanga, even if peace and order is bad, they still go.\",Tacloban is home to around 200,000 people. A bigger population often equates to more urbanization as more people require more housing, livelihood opportunities, infrastructure and facilities. But it also means more risk.,\"It causes concentrated risk. The more people will go to an area, the denser an area is, the more vulnerable to the effects of typhoons,\" he said.,SEVERE DAMAGE. The scene on a street just outside the Tacloban airport. Photo by Francis Malasig/EPA,High population may also mean the pace of urbanization was harder to manage and control. Despite land subsidence and the fact that Tacloban's coastal areas are below sea level, many important buildings were built right by the sea including the city hall, elementary schools, colleges and hospitals.,These could have been used as evacuation centers but because they too were close to the shore, they were among the structures first inundated by the storm surge.,But international disaster experts agree that not even the best prepared countries would have been spared by Yolanda, a storm that literally went off the charts. (READ: ,Conversations with disaster experts,),\"Given the destructive nature with which Haiyan hit the central Philippines even the best-prepared nation would have a hard time bracing itself against the effects of such a storm,\" Kathryn Hawley, a disaster management expert from Asia Foundation told Rappler's Marites Vitug.,\"When we try to prepare for hazard impacts as disaster managers we look to worse case scenarios but hope they never happen\u2026 When they do there are so many variables that can crumble the best-laid plans or preparation.\",Recommendations,After survival, the focus will be on reconstruction. Hinay said the study also makes recommendations on how Tacloban can better adapt itself to more extreme weather events in the coming years.,One such recommendation is moving development to higher ground.,\"Relocate higher. If they want to create coastal redevelopment, they should factor in 3 to 4-meter-high (9.8 to 13 feet) storm surges. Tacloban is one meter below sea level so you have to create coastal redevelopment that is higher than the storm surge,\" he explained.,He also urged the city to redefine land use based on Yolanda's devastation. Where should residences, schools, hospitals, businesses now be located? ,Investing in other sources of energy may also be a good idea, he said. Tacloban's dependence on the power grid left it in the dark when Yolanda destroyed all power lines. Investing in renewable energy may help lessen this potentially fatal dependence.,\"If you want your city to be more sustainable, you need renewable energy. It's more competitive, more sustainable. If you get cut off from the grid, at least the community can use renewable energy. We're also looking at resiliency of businesses and government. If there's a brown-out, they can still function and provide much-needed services if they have an alternative source of energy.\",Renewable energy sources like solar panels do not need electricity to function. If they are stored in a high area in the city, safe from flooding and storm surges, it can be used to power the community using only energy from the sun.,The complete assessment study will be released end of December, along with assessments of ,cities ,Angeles, Batangas and Naga.,WWF-Philippines also made climate change assessments of ,Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Davao, Dagupan, Iloilo, Laoag and Zamboanga from 2011 to 2012.

The comment was viewed as an insensitive remark.

He said new ,coaches for MRT-3 could be used by 2015,.,To further placate commuters, Coloma said he is forwarding complaints and suggestions that he has received on the MRT issue, to the DOTC.,Among them, he said, is a suggestion to allow passengers \"turn-arounds\" or letting passengers stay in a train as it returns to its starting point. Another suggestion was to require performance targets from maintenance contractors.,\"We will forward this suggestion on improving availability for consideration of the DOTC-MRT3 management,\" Coloma said.,He  also encouraged the public to continue sending suggestions on how they can improve services, adding it is important for the administration \"to know the true feelings of the people.\" ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/55255-palace-apologizes-for-poor-mrt-service", "title": "Palace official apologizes for 'insensitive' MRT remark", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161465-pagasa-defends-scientists-amid-project-noah-takeover,http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/208-infrastructure/55175-commuters-vitangcol-mrt-should-resign,http://www.rappler.com/nation/55234-commuters-ask-coloma-take-public-transpo"},

The first-time representative asked for time to mull over the offer.,\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared for something as big as this one. Over the past few days, I was asked to at least just be open to the idea. I was telling everyone if that I would be cerebral about it, the answer is really no,\u201d said Robredo.,On Tuesday, September 22, President Benigno Aquino III ,met, with Robredo and her two daughters to \u201cclear the air\u201d on the LP\u2019s offer.,When asked about the LP\u2019s offer, the Camarines Sur representative turned emotional  as she addressed the crowd at the Social Good Summit.,\u201c,Mahirap sagutin, (It\u2019s hard to answer).

Before being appointed to a Cabinet post, he was a multi-awarded mayor of Naga City.,The two met after the EDSA Revolution, in a government agency tasked to safeguard the Bicol River basin. Robredo was supposed to study and pursue a career in law, following the foot steps of her father. But public service beckoned. ,\u201cYou could say our love story was born out of the euphoria of EDSA \u2013 from the passion and desire to truly serve,\u201d she said.,Speaking at the Social Good Summit, Robredo talked about how in her late husband\u2019s more than two decades in politics, she chose to stay away from the limelight and instead focused on her own advocacies, working as a lawyer to the less privileged in the Bicol region.,\u201cMany say to be an empowered woman of our society, we always have to stand up and be heard, that all have to listen to our voice at every opportunity. Many say gender equality is all about being as strong as a man [but] in my life at least, it meant knowing when to let go of the limelight and knowing when to step up,\u201d said Robredo.,She added: \u201cI was lucky that I was blessed with a husband who allowed me to understand the true value of a woman. My husband valued my judgment because I valued mine.\u201d,The legacy of Jesse Robredo is among the many reasons why she says it\u2019s hard to turn down the LP\u2019s offer outright.,Difficult decisions,\u201c,Yung pagiging asawa ng asawa ko, merong mga ,considerations, na, bigger than ourselves., Klaro 'yun sa amin, so 'yun ang nakakapahirap.

The neophyte lawmaker is also worried about her district. Robredo ran in 2013 to ensure that the politically entrenched Villafuertes would not continue to lord over the 3rd congressional district of Camarines Sur.,The Robredo family\u2019s question back in 2012, when the plane bearing Jesse Robredo crashed of the coast of Masbate, was why things had to happen the way they did.,\u201c,Ngayon, 'yun rin ang tanong namin: Sa dinami-dami, bakit ako?

Robredo had said in earlier interviews that her 3 daughters are against her possible bid for the vice presidency.,Roxas is expected to meet with the Robredo children on the matter.,Robredo, a lawyer, had earlier expressed reservations about gunning for the second highest elective post in the country, saying it was ,\"too soon\", for someone like her who had just started a political career.,She joined the House of Representatives in 2013 and put an end to the Villafuerte dynasty in Camarines Sur. The Villafuertes are now allied with presidential wannabe Senator Grace Poe. ,On September 8, Robredo's supporters launched , a ,\"one million signatures\" campaign, in hopes of convincing the neophyte legislator to run for vice president.,The ruling party had wooed neophyte Senator Grace Poe to be its vice presidential candidate. Roxas' formal offer to Robredo comes two days after Poe announced her presidential bid.,Aside from Poe and Robredo, the LP also eyed Senate Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano as a possible running mate for Roxas. , READ: ,Who will be Mar Roxas' VP?

(READ: ,Will it be Mar-Chiz in Sorsogon?

Visa application may be the source of a few pre-travel worries, so find the most efficient way to get through it,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 There\u2019s the dream of travel, but there\u2019s also the reality of the paperwork involved.,More budget carriers are flying to Europe, the Middle East and the United States and more direct flights to these destinations are opening up. It\u2019s looking more and more like a buyer\u2019s market for travelers. The one thing that remains laborious and tedious is applying for a visa.,Preparing the necessary supporting documents for a visa to one country is already quite laborious. If you\u2019re traveling to more than one country and will require different visas, well, that only multiplies the minor inconveniences you\u2019ll have to go through.,Here are some ways to prepare for the visa application process without dampening ,your travel spirit,. ,1. Prepare a \u201cgrab bag\u201d of documents frequently requested ,Get a clearbook to hold all the documents that embassies usually require and make at least five copies of each of these documents. Usually, the embassy will need to look at the original copy for verification purposes and then just keep a photocopy. Make sure that your photocopies are clear. It will save you the trouble of having to photocopy another clearer copy while at the embassy ,Documents to include in this clear book are: ,Keep all your old passports with other visa stamps as reference. It may not fit in the clear book, but it should be made part of your visa app \u201cgrab bag.\u201d, ,(READ: ,5 travel essentials you need to invest in,) ,2. Keep a list of the countries you\u2019ve visited, ,Update the list of countries you've visited the way you would update your CV. Many embassies require you to list the countries you have visited within a certain number of years. Some embassies will specify a time frame, some will not, so it is best to start from countries you have visited from 5 years back. Keep a soft copy of this list in your computer and update it each time you travel.  ,3. Make a checklist of the visa application requirements \u2013 and triple check that!,When applying for a Schengen visa via the Italian embassy, for example, a checklist of requirements (which you can download along with the visa application form) is mandatory in the list of documents to be presented to the visa processing center. It is not a standard requirement for all countries, but a checklist is definitely a good thing to have on hand. Make one of your own if your destination country does not require it. ,Double and triple check each requirement, line by line if you have to. It will be worth the trouble because there are varying specifications for each country.,Look out for fine print like required payment mode: Is a manager\u2019s check required? Can you pay in Philippine pesos, US dollars or Euros? Tip is to pay in US dollars so you will not be subject to currency fluctuations. Remember to check for exact amount, e.g. if it says $58, bring $58 as some embassies will not offer change.,Double check the location of the visa processing centers as their addresses on the application forms may not be updated. I went to the Dubai visa processing agency along Arnaiz Road, as specified in their application form, only to be told that they had just moved to a new office in Pasong Tamo extension.,(READ: ,Packing for a trip? 9 common dilemmas,),4. Have a standard template for letters of introduction to consuls,Embassies may require you to prepare a letter to the consul to introduce yourself and state your reason for travel. Make a standard template for this letter of introduction, save on your \u201cTravel Docs\u201d folder and just fill in whenever you need to apply for a visa.,This cover letter should have:,5. Make your travel agent your travel buddy,Find a travel agent you can trust and make him or her your travel buddy. She can act as a semi-one-stop shop and help you book tickets and hotels that you won't have to pay for yet (you will want to wait till you get the visa before paying for a ticket or hotel), and facilitate travel insurance, which is now a requirement in Schengen countries.,This will (still) not guarantee you getting a visa, but it will at least ease the laborious preparation process of applying for one. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Photo of typewriter, from Shutterstock , ,Ana P.

Photo by Bea Cupin/Rappler ,ILOILO CITY, Philippines \u2013 Administration bets are normally seen to have the upper hand in national elections. But for Manuel Roxas II, the administration\u2019s standard-bearer, that isn\u2019t the case.,\u201c,Palagay ko, agawan ito kung sino ang underdog pero tayo ang underdog di ba,?\u201d said Roxas on Thursday, September 24, on the sidelines of a visit to a maritime school in this city. (This is going to be a contest of who the underdog is but clearly, I\u2019m the underdog here, right?),Roxas was asked about Vice President Jejomar Binay\u2019s previous claim that he was the \u201cunderdog\u201d in the coming 2016 elections.,Binay, the standard-bearer of the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), was the front runner in early presidential preference surveys until corruption allegations against him and his family surfaced and he refused to face a Senate probe early this year. His ratings plummeted after.,The latest surveys put Senator Grace Poe, who is also running for president, ahead of Binay and Roxas. ,In a Social Weather Stations (SWS) \u201c,top of mind,\u201d survey held in early September, Poe ranked first, Roxas second, and Binay third.,Another SWS poll which asked respondents to only pick one presidential candidate from a list of 12, puts all 3 at a ,statistical tie,, given the margin of error. Poe was still the top pick in that survey, followed by Binay and then Roxas. ,Prior to President Benigno Aquino III\u2019s endorsement, Roxas\u2019 numbers were dismal \u2013 as low as  4%. In contrast, both Poe and Binay have enjoyed high ratings in early presidential preference surveys.  ,Roxas\u2019 numbers surged recently after the endorsement and after he went all out in campaigning.,\u201c,Hindi ko naman ito binabalewala, hindi naman tayo nagiging complacent. Patuloy tayong magprepresenta ng ating plataporma, patuloy nating ipapakita yung mga kongkretong nangyari na\u2026 upang lalong makita at makumbinsi ang mga kababayan natin na dito na tayo sa Daang Matuwid,,\u201d said Roxas. (We are not dismissing the survey numbers... [but] we're not going to be complacent. We will continue presenting our platform. We\u2019ll continue showing the people what this administration has already achieved so that they see for themselves and are convinced that it\u2019s better to stick to the Daang Matuwid.),Daang Matuwid is the administration\u2019s catch-all phrase for its anti-corruption, good governance, and transparency platform. Roxas\u2019 campaign is centered on the idea that he would be able to continue the supposed gains of the administration. ,So for Roxas, his advantage in the May 2016 elections is not the resources of the government but its \u201ctrack record.\u201d ,\u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the resource as much as the track record. ,Itong nakaraang limang taon, hindi naman siguro natin ikakaila na malayo ang narating narin. Whether it\u2019s in the fiscal reform sector, anti-corruption drive, infrastructure, sa pagkalinga at aruga ng ating kababayan\u2026 ay malinaw na malinaw ang mga datos\u2026 na umangat na nga tayo,,\u201d he said.  (I don\u2019t think you can deny that in the past 5 years, we\u2019ve done a lot. Whether it\u2019s in the fiscal reform sector, anti-corruption drive, infrastructure or in taking care of our countrymen, the data is clear, we\u2019re doing better now.) ,The ruling Liberal Party (LP) is set to announce its senatorial slate on Monday, September 28.

{"content": "\nTravel tips from the Filipina who wrote the book on traveling on a shoestring budget    ,TEMPLES OF BAGAN. Inspired by Lonely Planet's winning photo, Rica recreated the picture during her own trip to Bagan in Myanmar. All photos from Ricasrucksack.com, reposted with permission,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Traveling is a hobby often associated with a huge budget. Some would even go as far as saying that traveling is just for those with tons of cash to spare. ,However, travel book author ,Ma. Patricia \"Rica\" Yulo, says it's only a matter of knowing and setting your priorities. Being a corporate slave earning an average monthly salary should not stop you from buying a ticket and seeing what lies beyond your comfort zone.,Here are tips on how to travel cheap we picked up from the experiences of the author of ,The 3rd World Traveler: A Guide to Fulfilling Your Travel Dreams on a Shoestring Budget,:,1. Save by traveling without checked luggage ,Rica suggests that you should always be on the lookout for airline promos so you can get your tickets cheap. But aside from that, you will ,save more money by traveling light,. If you can, try bringing just your large backpack, without checked luggage. ,She survived traveling to Singapore without one single bag, by placing all her essentials in her vest pockets. She admits that though it won't work for everyone, she learned a lesson from that trip: ,all your essentials can fit in one small backpack,.,How, you might say? In her book, Rica suggests the following:,LOCAL TOURISM. The author also spends time seeing the beauty of her own country,2. Stay in dorms or hostels,When Rica traveled to Singapore, a city known for its high standard of living, she stayed in a dormitory room shared with other travelers and students. This cost her between P400-700 per day. \"Traveling is about roaming the city, not staying in your hotel room the entire day. So why spend so much in a room if you know you're going to end up staying there for a short time only?\" she writes.,For the intrepid folks with a bit more experience in traveling, there is such a thing as a ',couchsurfing,' community where travelers get to stay with hosts in various countries.,3. Go for a cheaper commute,While there are some countries where cab fares are relatively cheap, it's still a good idea to take the train or bus. Some countries even have a tourist pass that will let you go around the city taking unlimited rides. ,Map out the city before you go; is it a walking city, or will you need a car to get around? If English is not the common language in the country, take the time to download or find a map in English beforehand. If you waste time or take a wrong turn, that cheap commute won't be so cheap anymore, especially if you have to take multiple trips to replace your steps. ,4. Research goes a long way,Before heading to any of her destinations, Rica spends a huge amount of time researching about the place and the people she will encounter. Look  for places where locals eat or drink and go there instead of the tourist hubs which tend to sell the same food and drinks for double the price.,Learn lessons from fellow travelers by joining travel forums.,Plan your itinerary. ,Which sites would you like to see?, Is there an entrance fee? Take everything into account. If you're trying to squeeze tons of activities in a single day, did you factor in the time spent in line? In some countries, you can preorder museum tickets so you won't have to spend hours waiting to buy your ticket, for example. Others let you buy tickets in bulk. ,BIG CITIES. Rica says backpacking is not confined to rural areas. Backpacking in big cities is as much fun,5. Safety is top priority,Don't risk it. Rica related that she and a friend were on their way to Siem Reap in Cambodia by land when when their hired car stopped in the middle of the road and a man forced himself in demanding for their money. They gave their money up.,If you're alone, let plenty of people know where you are back home. Memorize a loved one's phone number so that you have someone to call even if you lose your phone. ,Don't risk your life by eschewing safety measures in order to save a little more money. In the long run, the extra safety measures may help you avoid costly accidents and detours. ,Try this: traveling alone,No, it's not boring at all and it should be quite an experience. The dynamics of traveling in a large group are very different from traveling alone. (READ: ,5 tips in planning your first solo trip,),Just remember to dress appropriately, avoid staring too hard at people (Rica says this might lead to confrontations depending on the culture of the country you're in), always carry the address and number of your home country's nearest embassy, and stash your money in a hidden part of your outfit \u2013 not necessarily your wallet.,Always be calm and try to be friendly. It will be good to meet a local that will tell you about places in their country that travel guides never mention. (READ: ,safety tips for women traveling solo,),At some point, you might be lonely but take the time to find solace and enjoy the view.,PITSTOP. Rica ended up in Monkey Beach while trekking in Penang, Malaysia,Getting started on your adventure,You will need money. Even if it's cheap, backpacking stills entail saving and spending. In her book, Rica recommends looking into yourself whether traveling is actually a priority for you. If it is, saving should be easy. Looking forward to seeing new places will make skipping that unnecessary purchase a whole lot easier \u2013 just put the money in your travel fund.,Specificity is key. Choose your dream destination, stick with it, work towards it. Saying \"I want to visit Japan during cherry blossom season,\" versus \"I want to travel so bad,\" makes your dream all the more real. ,Rica adds that travelers should also take into account their savings back home, continuing to build at least the emergency fund even as they see the world. ,The next step will be the adventure itself. Don't be in a hurry. Travel to where your feet and your budget can take you. The author always says that traveling is about seeing the world, one step at a time. ,THE THAT LUANG. Taken during the author's trip to Laos where she spent her time with a local to learn about their culture and everyday life,What's next,Rica has made a decision that will make most mothers wince. She quit her job will be leaving the Philippines soon to travel \u2013 indefinitely. She admits that it's a road not often taken by the average Filipina, but she's going to take it.,She dreams of going to Norway just as soon as she figures out how she will fare in the country whose capital Oslo is known as one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in. ,How will she support herself in this long haul journey? She says she will take odd jobs and even do volunteer work to move her forward. ,She says she will figure it out along the way. And she will \u2013 like she always does in each of her adventures. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,',The 3rd World Traveler: A Guide to Fulfilling Your Travel Dreams on a Shoestring Budget,' is a ,self-published book, by experienced backpacker Ma.

He himself is seen as Poe's likely running mate.,The province's first district is held ,by Escudero's mother Representative Evelina Escudero, who is a member of the Nationalist People's Coaltion (NPC).,The second district is held by a member of LP but a good friend of Escudero's, Representative Deogracias Ramos. ,Mar-Chiz?, ,LP politicians in the province are saying they will support Escudero should he decide to run for ,vice president,. Thus they told Rappler they will likely go for \"Mar-Chiz\" for 2016.,What could further complicate matters is another politician from Sorsogon, Leni Robredo, the incumbent representative of Camarines Sur and LP chief for the entire Bicol region. ,Robredo is being eyed as ,Roxas' possible running mate, in 2016. ,When she was asked about LP-Sorsogon politicians going for a Mar-Chiz tandem, Robredo said: ,\"That is not what the agreement is. ,Mayroon ilan na dating, LP ,na ganun ,(Some LP old-timers are like that). But not all,\" said Robredo. ,\",Ang pakiusap namin sa kanila,, if they cannot abide by party rules ,magsabi lang ,(they can tell us). ,Ang pagasali sa partido, voluntary, lang, di ba ,(Joining a party is voluntary)?,\" she added.

She was present at the LP headquarters for the oath-taking of the Sorsogon politicians.,\"It\u2019s going to be a quandary. It\u2019s going to be a conflict. But I think with the good governance policy of President Noynoy to be followed by Mar Roxas, I think Sorsogon will go with Mar,\" she said.,\"They might go that (Mar-Chiz) way. I cannot predict. All I'm saying is Mar Roxas will take Sorsogon,\" she said.  ,Chiz's friend,Sorsogon's 2nd District Representative Ramos said he is sticking it out with the party despite his close ties to Escudero. He even brought along several more local politicians to the LP event.,OATH-TAKING.

But definitely Mar will be there as president,\" said Ramos, adding that ,the vice presidential race \"is another matter.\", ,What if Escudero asks them to support Poe instead? \"We are members of the party. It will not look good if I'll be supporting Poe if she runs. We don't even know if she\u2019s going to run,\" Ramos said., ,Ramos is the leader of LP in the 2nd district. ,His party mates, have been concerned that his friendship with Escudero would prompt him to bolt the party and ,support the anticipated Poe-Chiz tandem.,LP was relieved on Monday, August 24, when Ramos declared he would support the LP gubernatorial bid of Bobet Lee, the son of graduating governor Raul Lee.,On Thursday, he reaffirmed his commitment to LP along with 2nd district ,mayors Marniellie Robles of Bulan, Domingo Halum of Bulusan, Emilio Ubaldo of Matnog, and Benito Doma of Prieto Diaz.,Mayors Antonio Alindogan of Juban and Alejandro Gamos of Sta Magdalena, also from the 2nd district, were not present on Thursday's oath-taking but are expected to stay with LP.,The other mayors are expected to support Vice President Jejomar Binay and his new party United Nationalist Alliance party (UNA).,The governor's wife, ,Sorsogon City Mayor Sally Lee, and son Bobet Lee were also swore in on Thursday as new members of LP.,Former Lakas members, the governor and the mayor ran ,under the opposition UNA ticket in the 2013 elections. ,She dropped Binay to support Roxas instead.,She's the only mayor from the 1st district to join LP so far, but she said she is confident the other mayors will join her as soon as they learn that she has declared support for Roxas.,\"This is my commitment.

{"content": "\nStressed out about traveling? Erica Paredes shares her own approach to the art of travel     ,WANDERLUST. To me, it's always a butterflies-in-my-belly type of adventure. All photos courtesy of Erica Paredes,MANILA, Philippines ,\u2013, While most people complain about packing, airline food and immigration lines, I am usually in a state of happy confusion as I pick out my travel outfits, munch on plane fare with gusto and feel excited as I line up to get my passport stamped., ,I never understood why people whine so much about how stressful traveling is because to me, it's always a butterflies-in-my-belly type of adventure. I went on my first trip abroad at 10 months old and my first parent-free voyage at 10 years old, and as I grew, so did my wanderlust.,While my peers were spending all their money on YSL Muse bags and saving up for a pair of Louboutins, I was obsessively watching ,Globe Trekker,, then later on, ,No Reservations., ,Travel has become so much a part of my life that I have shifted from a fashion and beauty writing background to doing more on travel and food, and I've chosen a life of a freelancer so I can accommodate any trip that comes my way, be it a 5-day one to London for work or a two-month pleasure trip around Europe with my siblings. I think my experiences have taught me a thing or two about how to be a good traveler, but I know there's still a lot to learn. Here are my 10 commandments of traveling so far:, ,1. Do research., Every time I plan to travel anywhere, I always read up on where to go and what to do. Forget those touristy sites that will just tell you to go to the usual landmarks. Instead, Google your interests and what that city can offer in relation to that., ,For instance, I love street art, so I made sure to go to Belleville in Paris, Kreuzberg in Berlin and booked an apartment in Malasa\u00f1a in Madrid. Someone else with other interests might want to wander elsewhere., ,That said, there are certain tourist landmarks that one MUST see, still depending on personal taste or reasons. Mine was the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, and it was worth the hour and a half wait under the scorching Spanish summer sun.,GRAFFITI MECCA. At 5 pointz in Queens, New York. Many international artists have left their mark on these walls and it is a well-known spot to many New Yorkers,GET OUT THERE. My home for a week when exploring the Galapagos Islands. That place really changed my views on nature and made me realize a lot about life,DO AS THE LOCALS DO. We spent time on the streets of Paris during Fete de la Musique and met so many awesome people at that occasion,4. Have a sense of humor., Not all will be perfect when you decide to explore the world. There will be mishaps and unfortunate experiences and any seasoned traveler will tell you to roll with the punches. I always had this overly romantic idea of Prague, until we got there and got swindled by a taxi driver five minutes into arriving, and seeing the city sprinkled with casinos and sex shops. I was quite disillusioned at first but realized that there were still lots of beautiful things about the city. Truck on and chalk it up to experience. Remember that perfect trips don't always equate to fun stories later on.,DON\u2019T FORGET YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR. This was on a forever train ride from Ventimiglia (near the Italian-French border) to Nice. It was the height of summer and the train was packed, dirty and we had all our luggage with us. Oh well, we got a great few days at the French Riviera after this ordeal!,Packing efficiently is also a must. Bring clothes that can be worn in multiple ways and stick to the basics with maybe one or two statement pieces to tie your looks together. No need to bring your entire closet. You WILL go shopping.,6. Get Lost., Literally. The best way to get to know any new city is to get off your behind and walk. One on trip to Hong Kong with my cousin, I realized I was sticking too much to the familiar places and wanted to try something new. So, we hopped on the Metro and pointed at random stops where we needed to get off at and explore.,COME BACK.This is Kilometro Cero in Madrid, the very central point of Spain. It is said that whoever steps on it will definitely come back, so I made sure to jump in and out of it a few times, just to make sure! ,EURAIL TICKETS. Remember to be organized and book ahead because Eurail pass holders have a limited allotment for seats! ,FOOD TRIP. A great way to know a place and its people is through the food. This is a typical Pintxos (pronounced \"pinchos\") spread in San Sebastian, in Spain's Basque region,8. Be organized., Just because you want to run off and travel like a gypsy, does not mean you can't know exactly what you are doing when it comes to planning your flights, trains, accommodations and routes. Whenever I travel, I keep at least 2 copies of all my identification with me, as well as copies of plane or train tickets and any notes I may have taken about the place I am going to, so as not to waste time when I get there., ,I have a travel wallet and a folder I keep everything in and make sure to send emails a few days prior when booking through airbnb.com and reconfirming all my reservations beforehand. Once you have this all in order, you are free as a bird to do whatever you want, and will be able to enjoy so much more!,9. Be smart., I sometimes get this impression that people think that just because they are in a \u201cfirst world\u201d country, that everything is totally safe and perfect. Not so. Although I don't recommend being overly paranoid, practicing a bit of caution and staying on the alert is always beneficial, especially, but not limited to, when you are in what can be considered \u201cdodgy\u201d areas., ,A visit to Sacre-Coeur in Montmartre had my brother practically held up by these street scammers that would not let him go until he forked over 10 Euros. Theft is widespread nowadays and since times are hard for most, there will be people in any place you go to, whether a \u201cfirst world\u201d or \u201cdeveloping\u201d country, who will try to make money out of you at any cost.,10. Talk to people., From my experience, the friendliest type of traveler is the backpacker. They are usually younger, hungry for new experiences and love meeting people. A lot of the time, they are working with smaller budgets so they book hostels, sometimes sharing a room with 10 other strangers. Even if you prefer your own apartment or hotel room, always remember to talk to people as much as you can. Whether it's the bartender at the local pub, or someone standing in front of you at the Raclette stand in Borough Market, talking to new people, whether local or fellow tourists can lead your trip to other, more exciting places. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, , , ,Erica is a hippie in high heels, fashion renegade, world traveler, kitchen gangsta and tattoo collector", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/52564-ten-commandments-next-travels", "title": "10 commandments for your next travels", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156674-duterte-christmas-eve-photos"},
{"content": "\nGoing on a trip? Take these things with you. Stay safe and have fun!     ,THE ESSENTIALS. There are ways to save, but there are somethings you'll need to invest in ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Sure, everyone tells you there\u2019s a lot to learn by traveling, and with budget airfare, nifty boutique accommodations, and convenient direct flights opening up, you have more reason to just book and fly. ,But there are realities that come with the romance of travel and being far away from home. Right after you book your travel ticket, you might want to get started packing and planning other travel essentials\u2014those often overlooked items that can make a huge difference.,1. Get on four wheels,Invest in a great suitcase. Four-wheeled suitcases that can spin 360 degrees are the latest travel craze among manufacturers who are all in a race to \u201creinvent the wheel.\u201d And with reason, these spinners are easy to push and pull around long winding queues and expansive airport terminals without straining your arms and shoulders. You can also push the bag in front of you, if that\u2019s what you prefer to do. As if these zingers weren\u2019t enough, you can hoist your overstuffed handbag on these four-wheeled wonders so you don\u2019t have to lug it. I call it a travel investment.  ,2. A cross-body bag with lots of compartments ,You don\u2019t really realize how heavy a bag with a camera (even a small point and shoot), a phone, a wallet, and a small makeup kit can be until you try walking around with it the whole day. Cross-body bags distribute the weight so the straps don\u2019t bite into your shoulders. They\u2019re also easier to keep an eye on because they can be worn in front of you (unlike a shoulder bag and/or a backpack). The many compartments make it hard for pickpockets to get their hands on your stuff, but make it a snap for you to find things.,3. Comfortable and durable shoes,After four different trips where my show sole was nearly torn apart, I realized I needed to tuck on the qualifiers \u201csturdy\u201d and \u201cdurable\u201d to comfy when looking for shoes. I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s the shoes with the soles glued on \u2013 as opposed to stitched on \u2013 that are the most prone to splitting open after continuous days of walking. Sneakers are probably best type to wear on a trip in both hot and cold weather. Have band-aids on hand for blisters or other wounds. Clear packing tape for emergencies won\u2019t hurt either. ,4. Travel insurance ,Make sure you\u2019re ready for adventure and just about anything unexpected. Traveling brings with it the possibility of mishaps, from delayed flights to weather disturbances to lost luggage. Throw in Murphy\u2019s Law + climate change and you just might encounter all three in one trip. Weather changes, fatigue, or eating an exotic dish your stomach couldn\u2019t handle can also make you prone to getting sick. Be prepared for anything that might happen and get travel insurance to make sure it covers the basics like medical treatment and lost/delayed/damaged luggage. For the most adventurous travelers, check for travel insurance packages that will cover extreme activities.  ,5. A fully stocked emergency pack,Apart from the usual, take the time to put together an emergency kit specific to your destination. A cruise would require motion sickness pills. A pack of diarrhea pills would be handy for every trip and a nail cutter with nail file is an often overlooked essential, but remember to keep it in your suitcase, not your carry-on, where sharp items might not be allowed on board the plane.,Travel safe and have fun! ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Photo of woman at the airport, from Shutterstock , ,Ana P.

Photo by Joel Leporada/Rappler Photo by Joel Leporada/Rappler Photo by Joel Leporada/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The presidency was a position Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas II prepared for as early as 2008, when he got the Liberal Party\u2019s endorsement as its standard-bearer for the 2010 elections. ,He, let go of this plan, in late 2009 given the popular sentiment then: for Benigno Aquino III, son of EDSA Revolution icons senator Benigno Aquino Jr and Cory Aquino to lead the country instead. (READ: ,Mar Roxas: The long road to endorsement,),Five years later, Roxas, who was Aquino\u2019s transportation and later, interior  secretary, again gears up for a presidential bid, but the situation is different. He has waited patiently for the endorsement of the President he helped win amid supposed factions in the same coalition they forged together. (READ: ,Aquino endorses Roxas,),For him, a bid for the presidency \u201cis not about me\u201d but giving Filipinos what is due them \u2013 \u201cthe kind of service that they should get because they deserve it.\u201d,WATCH: ,Live: President Aquino endorses Roxas,Roxas comes from a long line of politicians: his grandfather and namesake, former president Manuel Roxas, is the founder of the party he now heads. His father, the late Senator Gerardo Roxas, is touted as among the LP leaders who relentlessly  assailed the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. His younger brother, Gerardo Manuel \u201cDinggoy\u201d Roxas, Jr, was Capiz representative until he died of colon cancer in 1993. ,His promise is simple: under a Roxas presidency, the Aquino administration\u2019s good governance and anti-corruption programs, tagged \u201cDaang Matuwid (Straight Path),\u201d continues. (READ: ,Mar Roxas accepts challenge, vows 'straight path',),As part of Rappler\u2019s #PHvote \u201cThe Leader I Want Series,\u201d we look at Roxas\u2019 stand on issues the next president will have to zoom in on: corruption, social inequality, climate change and disasters, foreign policy, OFWs, and peace in Mindanao. ,What gains from the Aquino administration should Roxas continue and which strategies should be changed? ,Tell us in the comments section below or tweet using #TheLeaderIWant why or why not Roxas should be the next leader of the country., ,CLICK ON THE MOOD METER: ,How do you feel about Mar Roxas' take on issues,?,1. Corruption,Roxas\u2019 stand on corruption is no different from the President\u2019s and their allies: they will chase after the corrupt, and put them in jail if need be. Proof of Aquino\u2019s resolve in curbing corruption in government, their supporters would say, is the ongoing trial and continued detention of 3 opposition senators over the so-called \u201cpork barrel scam.\u201d,But the drive goes both ways: Aquino, Roxas, and the administration have been accused of \u201cselective justice\u201d or scrutinizing only those with different political affiliations, and turning a blind eye on their allies. ,Roxas has ,denied these allegations,, particularly those coming from his 2016 nemesis, Vice President Jejomar Binay, the standard-bearer of the opposition United Nationalist Alliance. Binay is at the center of a months-long Senate probe into corruption allegations which the Vice President claims is being orchestrated by Roxas. ,He says accusations of \u201cselective justice\u201d are baseless since members of the Liberal Party have also been suspended by the Ombudsman or convicted by the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan. ,2. Social Inequity,One of the Aquino government\u2019s key programs Roxas is sure to continue is the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), which offers beneficiaries cash grants so long as they meet requirements \u2013 family development sessions, pre- and post-natal care for pregnant women, check-ups and vaccines for children, school enrolment, and at least 85% class attendance per month for school-age beneficiaries.,The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) is among the agencies involved in the program, which is spearheaded by the Department of Social Welfare and Development. ,But the program is not without its critics. Under the Arroyo administration, the conditional cash transfer program was alleged to have been mishandled. The Aquino administration beefed up spending for the program, which is said to be flourishing. ,Aquino, in his last State of the Nation Address, chided critics of the 4Ps, emphasizing that it will take time for the fruits of the flagship program to be felt \u2013 again stressing the need for the next president to continue his administration\u2019s \u201cDaang Matuwid.\u201d ,The DILG, under Roxas, also zoomed in on improving the conditions of impoverished Filipino families: the relocation of informal settlers in Metro Manila, a potable water program for far-flung barangays, a grassroots budgeting program for local government units, and a special fund for conflict-torn or vulnerable communities. ,Those projects, however, have also been subject to intense criticism by legislators who claim Roxas, through the DILG, is using government funds to further his political clout. ,During his stint as legislator, Roxas penned the ,Cheaper Medicines Act, \u2013 a law  borne out of his own experience: the illness of his younger brother made him realize how expensive it can be to treat a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d illness. ,3. Climate change and disaster,As DILG secretary, Roxas is also the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council's vice chairman for disaster preparedness. Roxas has been on the front line of the Aquino administration\u2019s biggest crises, both man-made and natural. ,He led response efforts in the aftermath of the ,2013 Visayas earthquake, and was in Zamboanga for more than a month during the 2013 siege by Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters allied with Nur Misuari.,Roxas was one of two Cabinet secretaries who were sent to Eastern Visayas ahead of the landfall of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). He eventually led post-disaster operations in the area. ,His involvement in pre- and post-disaster operations is expected to become fodder for his foes come campaign time, as he was criticized for his role in the Zamboanga siege and in Yolanda operations. ,The weaknesses of LGUs' disaster preparations became apparent in the aftermath of Yolanda, which ravaged numerous towns and cities in Eastern Visayas. Politics and the sense of an unclear leadership on the ground made the situation worse. ,Post-Yolanda, the NDRRMC changed and improved its processes. Weather forecasting was upgraded and the DILG, under Roxas, devised a \u201cchecklist\u201d for local government units in preparing for stronger typhoons \u2013 the \u201cnew normal.\u201d ,4. Foreign policy,The Aquino administration will perhaps be most remembered for its strong stance against China, which is claiming practically the entire West Philippine Sea (South China Sea). In his public statements, Roxas reflected the same position.,Weeks before announcing his presidential bid, Roxas was in Masinloc, Zambales, where the effects of China\u2019s claims are strongly felt by the fishing community. (READ: ,From Masinloc to The Hague: A question of livelihood,),\u201cAng para sa Pilipinas ay dapat manatili sa kamay ng Pilipino. Dedepensahan natin ang atin, (What\u2019s for the Philippines should remain in the hands of Filipinos. We will defend what is ours),\u201d Roxas told an audience of locals. ,The forum was held the same week top government officials were in The Hague, the Netherlands, over China\u2019s claims. Filipino fishermen had been driven away from Bajo de Masinloc by Chinese boats. Just this week, ,Chinese-marked buoys were found near Zambales,. ,Roxas said the Philippines is not looking for trouble, as China typically asserts, but is simply taking a stand against China\u2019s claims. ,As DILG chief, Roxas\u2019 focus was mostly on listening and responding to the concerns of locals. The DILG, in coordination with other government agencies, has been working on providing alternative livelihood for fishermen affected by the standoff between the Philippines and China.,5. OFWs,While Roxas is no stranger to life as an overseas Filipino \u2013 he was a US-based investment banker before he ran for public office \u2013 his experience was different from the millions of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who usually take on blue collar jobs abroad. Roxas\u2019 jobs in the Aquino administration, thus far, have not really exposed him to OFWs, among the pillars of the Philippine economy. ,An issue Roxas will need to address should he be elected president is the plight of OFWs, who find themselves on the losing end of their host country\u2019s justice system. Over 80 OFWs are currently on death row. ,Mary Jane Veloso, who is on Indonesia\u2019s death row for alleged drug smuggling, has become the latest example of this problem. ,Roxas, in a previous conversation with Rappler, says among his goals is to make sure that each Filipino is given enough opportunities: a good education and decent job opportunities. (By Roxas' count, 6 Filipinos are born every second.),This echoes the repeated pronouncements of Aquino that the government should strive to provide good jobs at home so that Filipinos would not be compeled to seek greener pastures abroad.,Despite the government\u2019s gains, however, unemployment in the Philippines still ranks highest in Southeast Asia, according to the World Bank.,6. Peace in Mindanao ,Although he is among Aquino\u2019s most trusted, Roxas was kept in the dark in the lead-up to ,one of the Aquino administration\u2019s biggest crisis,, which has also endangered the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL).,The aftermath of \u201cOplan Exodus,\u201d a Philippine National Police (PNP) Special Action Force (SAF)-led operation against two top terrorists, threatened to derail the proposed law which will create a new autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao. It is hoped to end decades of armed conflict in the area. ,Although many politicians criticized the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) over the death of 44 PNP SAF troopers, Roxas remained mum of the issue \u2013 until, in an uncharacteristic moment, he, turned emotional, and questioned the Armed Forces of the Philippines\u2019 supposed inaction during the operation. ,Roxas, like all of Aquino\u2019s Cabinet secretaries, is a staunch supporter of the peace process \u2013 touted as among the biggest successes of the administration. ,But with limited time in Congress, even the staunchest supporters of the BBL are doubtful that it will be passed before Aquino steps down.

This is her story    ,Anyone in their early-to-mid twenties has at some point reached a crossroads where they have had to decide which direction their life is heading in. For some this is easy; they have a clear set of goals and objectives and they know exactly how they are going to achieve them. Go to university, become a lawyer, a banker, an architect\u2026whatever you know you want to be. ,TIME TO EXPLORE. Ready, set, go,But what if you don\u2019t know? What if you can\u2019t see yourself fitting into any of the career options that everyone who matters says you have to choose from? ,I'm from the Philippines, where it\u2019s a cultural expectation that you finish university, get your degree, choose a career, buy a house and car, get married, then have some kids. And by the way, if you won\u2019t have time off from work to look after your children, their grandmother will do that for you! ,Any passions you may have had before become side-line interests that fit in around the \u201cimportant stuff.\u201d Dreams of traveling the world become week-long annual holidays and package cruises.  ,Self-fulfillment becomes a constant self-comparison with brothers and sisters, cousins and former classmates.  Doesn\u2019t that all sound just marvelous?,But what if there is another way?  What if there are a whole host of options that you\u2019re not told about by your parents, university, or friends? ,Imagine if you could be completely free, go where you want when you want and not just earn, but actually save money at the same time. ,You don't have to be a flight attendant, cruise ship worker, travel writer or a company executive to get paid to travel. You can earn money in a variety of different ways, anywhere in the world.,IN ANOTHER LIFE. At my last job in Kuwait, weeks before I moved to Kurdistan, Iraq. All photos provided by Kach Medina,The beginning,After graduating university in 2009, I worked in Kuwait, the Middle East, for 4 years where I worked up to the position of Quality Assurance Supervisor. ,I had a good job, my own car, a rented apartment and an expensive gym membership. I went on holidays to 15 different countries and even bought property in the Philippines.  ,People who knew me saw me as successful and my parents were happy. I was winning\u2026or at least I thought I was.,It wasn't until I moved to Kurdistan, Northern Iraq, for a new job that I began to question things. I had a higher salary, more benefits and most importantly great friends.  But there was something missing inside that couldn't be filled by any of those things. ,I began to realize that what I really wanted was to travel, to be completely free of work and schedules. To know that I could go anywhere in the world and not just survive, but thrive.,My peers and colleagues told me I was crazy to waste the opportunities I had. After all, how many 24 year-old women, let alone Filipinas, had the chances and the life I had?,LIFE ABROAD. With my friends in Kurdistan, Iraq,Despite this, against all the advice of my peers and protests of family members (my father completely disowning me!), I quit my job, gave away my possessions and packed my bags. ,My initial plan was to head to Thailand and travel Southeast Asia for 3 months, before flying to South America. Having not seen my brother and sister in two years, I decided to take them with me.,Life during my travels, ,Traveling was everything I had wanted it to be and more.  I went places and saw things I had never seen before \u2013 good, bad and completely weird! I ate new food (a lot of it!), had amazing new experiences and met loads of awesome people.   ,One of these people came in the form of a British guy in his late twenties, who had also quit his job, given away his possessions and started a new life on the road.  ,We met in Luang Prabang, Laos, and although we seemed to have very similar thoughts and ideas, we were on two separate paths and inevitably went our separate ways. ,My brother and sister traveled with me until Vietnam, when my budget could no longer support all of us.  I continued traveling on my own for another 2 months through Cambodia and Thailand, when I decided it was time to have a rest in one place and figure out my next moves.  ,With my siblings in Nha Trang, Vietnam,I chose a month-long yoga retreat on Koh Pha Ngan, Thailand where I tried to understand what it was I really wanted to do in life and contemplate if my father was indeed right and I was just having a quarter-life crisis.,Begin again,As the yoga retreat came to an end, I was approaching my 25,th, birthday.  I had actually kept in touch with the British guy from Luang Prabang, who was now living and working in Hanoi.  He asked me to come back to Hanoi for a motorbike trip around North Vietnam.  ,MEMORY. The day we met. Luang Prabang, Laos,I still had no plans and a big motorbike trip had been on my bucket list for a long time, so I booked my flight and a two week visit soon turned into a month and I ended up living and working in Hanoi for the next 7 months. ,Having been living in Vietnam for a few months, we started planning our next big trip \u2013 a 3-year, around-the-world work and holiday adventure. (READ: ,10 Commandments for your next travels,),To achieve this we needed to save as much as possible in order to travel for at least a few months without working.  ,Jonathan was already teaching English in a private school and took on extra work. I decided to get my TEFL certificate so that I could teach as well.  ,I started teaching one-on-one English classes for adults as well as children in local schools, took on a part time marketing job in a Western company, and even joined a Vietnamese reality TV show! ,Jonathan sold his motorbikes; we packed our things and flew to India in February 2014 for the start of our at least 3-year adventure. ,The big trip: work and holiday, ,We spent  three months traveling all over India and while we were there decided to invest some time and money to become certified yoga teachers and Ayurveda massage therapists. These are things we have both had interests in and practiced for some time, so we thought, \u2018Why not make a living out of it?\u2019 Yoga is constantly growing in popularity across the globe and almost everyone loves a really good massage!,As we\u2019ve traveled we\u2019ve helped out in bars and restaurants in exchange for free food and even done some reviews and marketing for cheaper hotel rooms. It all helps your money stretch that bit further. ,It was this kind of thinking and experience that led us to discover Help Exchange, a website where you can find volunteer work in exchange for free food and accommodation. In our free time we can explore, arrange yoga classes and do massages for extra income. (READ: ,5 tips for your budget trips,),As a reward for all our hard work and ingenuity, we even had a week-long holiday at the Maldives, and 3 weeks in the UK to explore and meet Jonathan\u2019s family before flying to South America.,We were in the Peruvian Andes for a month, working in a hostel surrounded by mountains and Incan Ruins, with free bed and food.  ,Now, we temporarily settle here in Arequipa, Southern Peru with a freelance teaching job and our own Yoga and Massage business. We eat well, run yoga classes for the soul-seekers and heal the people's aching bodies with Ayurveda massage therapy.  ,We plan to continue this way of life as we travel through South America with a side trip to Antartica, before moving on to Oceania and finally coming to rest in the Philippines in 2017 or 2018 \u2013 to build a Sustainable Earthship Yoga Retreat Resort, but that\u2019s another story. ,SEEING THE WORLD. At Machu Picchu,Realizations, ,So now, after 16 months of being on the road, we don\u2019t have a car, a house, a \u2018respectable career\u2019 and we\u2019re probably not keeping up with the ex-classmates and cousins either. The investment property burden, by forces out of our control, fell through and a refund is on its way.  ,All we have now are our 15-kilo backpacks and ourselves, brimming with optimism and vision that didn\u2019t seem possible in our old lives.,WITH LOVE. At the Taj Mahal, Agra, India,Do I have any regrets about leaving my stable corporate job for an unpredictable traveling lifestyle? Never! I may not have the same luxury and security I had before, but now I have something far more fulfilling: the freedom and inner happiness I was searching for all those years ago.  ,So to my fellow women, Filipinos, or backpackers\u2026yes, you can have the traveling life you want, earn money and be successful at the same time.  ,You just need your own definition of success, outside of the norms of society and culture.

His survey numbers were great; he was way ahead of his rivals Loren Legarda and Jejomar Binay in the vice presidential preference polls.,He knew he had enough cushion that would allow him to run Aquino's campaign. Thus by the middle of March 2010, Roxas began holding daily meetings with the staff to plot Aquino's activities, joining campaign sorties only after lunch. ,\u2013 President Benigno Aquino III on Manuel Roxas II during the 2015 SONA,That judgment call came at a heavy price.,From being a shoo-in for the vice presidency, Roxas and his team saw the steady rise of the man who would win a come-from-behind victory: Jejomar Binay.,In a Social Weather Stations survey released the week before the May 2010 elections, Binay suddenly rose by more than 12 points, narrowly edging out Roxas.,By the time Liberal Party leader and his team finally took notice of Binay\u2019s numbers, it was too late.,Lessons from 2010,So back in ,April 2014,, when Roxas dismissed early surveys putting him at rock bottom, he had 2010 in mind. It's a long way to go before voting day, as far as he's concerned.,When we asked him what's the biggest lessson he's learned from 2010, Roxas told Rappler: \"Don't take things for granted.\",It appears now that he has taken this lesson to heart \u2013 gauging from the steps (and missteps) he has made to finally get what he's getting on Friday, July 31, at the historic Club Filipino: an endorsement from the President he helped win, and the party that brought them together.,WATCH IT LIVE: President Aquino's 2016 endorsement ,It hasn't been easy.,In June 2011, a year after his big loss, Roxas was appointed Secretary of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC).,He became one of Aquino's closest advisers, as the President consulted him on issues that went beyond his department\u2019s concerns \u2013 politics included. (READ: ,Aquino's inner circle,),He was \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 among the prominent personalities of the so-called \u201cBalay\u201d faction in the Palace, or the group associated with the LP.,He was eventually appointed Secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) after the death of its former chief, Jesse Robredo, in 2012.,PRESIDENT'S MAN. President Benigno Aquino II, Mar Roxas, and other Cabinet secretaries during the Typhoon Yolanda response. File photo from Aquino's Facebook page File photo from Aquino's Facebook page,Crisis and criticism,As DILG chief, Roxas was at the frontlines of the Aquino administration\u2019s biggest crises, particularly in 2013: the quake that hit the Visayas, the Zamboanga siege, and the devastation of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan).,Roxas\u2019 performance in the latter 2 crises, critics and some allies say, will be used by his rivals during the campaign.,Roxas was accused of bungling ,operations ,during the protracted Zamboanga siege by Muslim rebels. Records showed that among those killed were 183 Muslim rebels, 18 soldiers, 5 cops, and 12 civilians. ,Roxas was also ,criticized heavily, for the government\u2019s response to Yolanda, which saw majority of the Eastern Visayas region down on its knees.,There\u2019s irony, however, that Roxas found himself ,out-of-the-loop, in the lead-up to what would be the biggest crisis of the Aquino administration: \u201cOplan Exodus,\u201d a Philippine National Police (PNP) Special Action Force (SAF)-led operation that claimed the lives of more than 60, including 44 elite cops.,Roxas, who is also chairman of the National Police Commission, did not know of the operation until after the casualty reports came in. In contrast, Aquino was in briefings with his friend, then suspended PNP chief Alan Purisima.,At the height of the Masamapano crisis, Roxas's friends and supporters advised him to ,step down as DILG chief,.,Roxas told Rappler that while the clamor for him to quit was intense at the time, he ultimately decided against it. ,He said doing so would have simply satisfied his ego \u2013 a \"selfish move.\",MAMASAPANO CRISIS. Mar Roxas is joined by former PNP OIC Leonardo Espina during the arrival of 42 of 44 slain SAF troopers. File photo  ,And when Aquino made him wait for his endorsement, he waited. He waited and went through the motions of meetings, consultations, and dinners with the one who almost snatched it away from him: ,Senator Grace Poe,.,Not a few were puzzled by all this. But Roxas did say in 2009: \",Hindi kami maghihiwalay ni Noy,. I will stand by him.\",Roxas once referred to Aquino as his \u201cDinggoy,\u201d Roxas\u2019 younger brother who died of cancer in 1993. ,\u201cI tell you now and make no mistake, Noynoy is my Dinggoy. He\u2019s my brother. He\u2019s the brother that I lost. You have to work harder for Noy then than you work for me,\u201d Roxas is quoted as telling his campaign team in \u201c,Ambition, Destiny, Victory,.\u201d,Reluctant politician,It was because of the untimely death of Gerardo Manuel \u201cDinggoy\u201d Roxas Jr. that Roxas was thrust into the political sphere.,Roxas was already a successful investment banker in the US. Politics was supposed to be the playground of his younger brother, who was \",cuter and fairer,,\" in Roxas' own words.,Roxas entered Congress in 1993 as the newly-elected representative of Capiz halfway through Dinggoy\u2019s term.,Dinggoy is not the only Roxas who preceded the interior secretary in politics.,His namesake, Manuel Roxas, who was president of the Philippines from 1946 until his death in 1948, founded the Liberal Party in 1946. His father, Senator Gerardo Roxas, is credited by the LP as one of its members who was relentless in fighting the regime of Ferdinand Marcos.,OF FAMILY AND LEGACY. Mar Roxas visits the graves of his grandfather, father and younger brother \u2013 all former politicians, all members of the Liberal Party. Photo sourced by Rappler ,On Wednesday evening, July 29, on the eve of the President's endorsement of his candidacy, Roxas visited the graves of his grandfather, father, and brother in North Cemetery to \u201cseek guidance and strength,\u201d according to Yacap partylist representative Carol Lopez, one of several political allies who accompanied Roxas to the late night trip. (READ: ,All roads lead to Club Filipino: Aquino to endorse Roxas,),\u201c,After na nag-usap kami ng [Pangulong Benigno Aquino III], kahapon ng hapon, nag-laan talaga ako ng konting panahon para bisitahin ang aking lolo, ama, kapatid na siyang naging lingkod bayan rin. Malilinis ang kanilang mga pangalan, maganda ang kanilang serbisyo at parang feel ko lang na gusto kong makipagbond sa kanila,,\u201d Roxas told reporters in a chance interview on Thursday, July 30.,(After I spoke with President Aquino yesterday afternoon, I made sure to take the time to visit my grandfather, father, and brother who were also once public servants. Their names are clean, their track record is good and I felt like I wanted to bond with them.),Roxas turned emotional, his voice cracking, when he continued to explain why he decided to pay his relatives a visit. It\u2019s the work of his grandfather, father, and brother that guides him to this day, he said.,\u201c,Para sariwain ang mga\u2026 para masariwa, sariwain itong mga prinsipyo, batayang prinsipyo na siyang gumabay sa akin sa mga nakaraang araw na ito,,\u201d Roxas said. (I wanted to remember the principles, the core principles that have guided me in the past few days.),It\u2019s been indeed a long and winding road to Club Filipino. ,For years, Roxas dodged questions about 2016 by saying, ,\u201c,Darating at darating rin tayo diyan, (The time will eventually come).\",The time has finally come. But he knows how tough it's going to be \u2013 even if he will make sure not to take anything for granted this time. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

{"content": "\nHere are some places to go when visiting Japan's capital on a tight schedule    ,TYPICAL TOKYO. A line of souvenir shops outside Senso-Ji Temple on a regular day. All photos by David Lozada/ Rappler,TOKYO, Japan \u2013 Towering skyscrapers, beautiful temples, busy streets, delectable food, and expensive shopping. This was how I imagined Tokyo \u2013 and I was right in every way.,I had a short trip to Japan\u2019s capital city last November to participate in the ,2013 Developing Asia Journalism Awards and Forum, organized by the Asian Development Bank Institute. Due to the jampacked schedule of the conference, I only had half a day to go around one of the world\u2019s most visited cities.,Luckily for me, I had Japanese friends who toured me around the city. So even with the short time I had, I was able to do a lot, and the few places I visited showed me a lot about Japanese culture, history, and tradition.,Temples and towers,SENSO-JI TEMPLE. This place is one of the most visited spots in Tokyo.,My friends took me first to the Senso-ji Temple, arguably the most famous and most visited Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Foreigners, pilgrims, and locals come here to get blessed and pray for guidance.,The temple is beautiful and well-preserved despite the daily volume of visitors. The design follows traditional Japanese architecture and religion.,Beside the temple is the Asakusa Shinto shrine. It has a beautiful garden with little homes that Shintoists believe houses the spirits of their ancestors. Since I visited in November, the garden was in full autumn beauty. The ambience was perfect for reflecting and meditating.,ASAKUSA IN AUTUMN. A view of the famous Shinto shrine in an Autumn afternoon.,Outside the temple is the place to shop for authentic Japanese souvenirs. Before reaching the temple\u2019s gate, you\u2019ll pass by a stretch of shops that sell every Japanese souvenir possible, from lanterns to fake katanas to fans.,Tokyo has two skyscrapers that are worth visiting: the Tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Skytree. Due to the time constraint, I was only able to visit the former.,NOT PARIS. A view of the Tokyo Tower at night.,Used primarily for communication and tourism purposes, the Tokyo Tower is Japan\u2019s version of Paris\u2019 Eiffel and Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Menara KL. Standing at more than 1,000 feet, it is also the second tallest structure in Japan (Tokyo Skytree stands 2,080 feet high).,I suggest visiting the tower at night, as my friends and I did, in order to see the tower with all its lights. The FootTown building in the tower\u2019s base is also a good place to have a snack and shop for souvenirs.,Sumida River cruise,BY THE RIVER. One of the many views along the Sumida River cruise.,This is a must-try for tourists visiting Tokyo, as the Sumida river cruise takes you across the city in less than an hour.,Since there was a station located a few blocks away from the Senso-ji Temple, my friends and I rode the cruise to reach the Tokyo Tower. It was a good ride for sightseeing and relaxing. The water buses also have restaurants inside so passengers can drink hot tea or coffee while moving along the Sumida river.,We got off the cruise at the famous Hama-rikyu Gardens, which was located at the mouth of the Sumida river.,TOKYO TWILIGHT. A view of the Tokyo sunset from the Hamarikyu Gardens.,Hama-rikyu is a public park in the center of the city, near the Tokyo Tower. It\u2019s a perfect place to exercise or reflect in at anytime of the day. Visitors can also drink tea or other refreshments in the restaurant in the middle of the park.,When we visited, the park was a coloful sight, thanks to autumn. The leaves looked as if they were burning in the sun\u2019s rays.,The river cruise costs around JPY200 and the entrance to the park roughly JPY100.,Shopping and beer,SHIBUYA. This famous shopping district is hailed as Japan's Times Square.,A visit to one of the world\u2019s tourist hotspots won\u2019t be complete without shopping and a bit of drinking. So I made sure I had time for both.,On my last night in the city, I visited Shibuya, Tokyo\u2019s shopping district and a famous nightlife area for young people. You can find several fashion department stores and almost every brand here. Shibuya 109 is a major shopping mall where you can buy Japanese-style clothes.,For those looking for cheap buys, go to the Don Quijote shop in Shibuya. This store chain has everything from clothing to furnitures to groceries. Every product is sold at a discounted price and the store is open until late night (some are even open 24 hours).,Want to have some beer to cap the day? Check out one of the many bars in the district! My friends took me to this restaurant where we ate shabu-shabu and had unlimited alcohol for only JPY2,500 per person. You can choose from draft beer, imported alcohol, and the traditional sake.,SHABU-SHABU. The authentic Japanese meal and unlimited alcohol are a great way to end the day.,On one of the nights of the conference, I visited Ginza with the other participants. For those who like high-end brands and have the budget, Ginza is the place for you \u2013 the district is considered as one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world. There are also many coffee shops and bars where you can warm yourselves during cold weather.,Tokyo transportation,Tokyo has one of the world\u2019s most complicated train systems. Compared to those of Taipei, ,Bangkok,, and Seoul, the subway system in Tokyo is not as tourist-friendly as most of the signs are in Nihongo. The friendliness of the Japanese, however, makes up for this so there\u2019s no need to worry. It\u2019s easy to ask around for directions to anyone passing by.,Short trips normally range from JPY100 to JPY300, while trips involving many train transfers could go as high as JPY600 (JPY 100 = US$1).,There is also a train line going to and from the Narita International Airport from Tokyo Central Station and it costs around JPY1,300. This is the cheapest way to get to the airport aside from the bus. Our group of Filipino journalists had to take a cab going to our hotel when we arrived since our flight got delayed. We had to pay the cab JPY22,000 from Narita to Chiyoda-ku.,Cab drivers are friendly and professional. They don\u2019t ask for more than what\u2019s on the meter and will insist on giving your change.,There are so many places to explore in Tokyo. A week should be the minimum spent there for vacation. The city is beautiful during autumn, but I heard it\u2019s much more beautiful in springtime because of the cherry blossoms.,Lastly, remember to bring a big budget if planning to visit this city. Tokyo, after all, is one of the ,world\u2019s most expensive cities, to live in., \u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/47110-tokyo-travel-half-day", "title": "Tokyo in half a day", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/business/168878-roberto-lim-dotr-undersecretary-aviation-resigns,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/44303-david-lozada-developing-asia-journalism-award,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/19942-travelthursday-wats-shopping-beer-in-bangkok"},

(READ: ,Obama to visit PH April 28,),\"I'm hopeful that there will be a conclusion before the visit of President Obama,\" Cuisia told reporters in Manila. \",This agreement will enable us to build a minimum credible defense posture.

Batino said the agreement \"would ,provide significant benefits to the Philippines\" in modernizing the military, attaining minimum credible defense posture, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).,Amid criticism that the deal would allow American \"de facto basing\" in the Philippines, the panels maintain that it is a temporary agreement that is effective for less than 20 years. Details of the draft agreement have not been shared but panel members have earlier divulged details. ,The talks hit an impasse last year when the US wanted to limit the access of Filipino troops to facilities they are going to build here.

During the Aquino administration, it did not hit 40%, it was always around 30%. It was even lower during Gloria [Macapagal Arroyo\u2019s] time,\u201d he told Rappler.,He commended the administration for higher conditional cash transfer funds, new rice grant funds under CCT, and the P19.4 billion Assistance to Disadvantaged Municipalities.,\u201cIt\u2019s going to help because that\u2019s a direct transfer. Any additional transfer to the poor municipalities, any real transfer that happens to the poor is something to be welcomed for us,\u201d he said.,Serrano thinks the large budgets for education, health, and social services go well with the Duterte administration\u2019s goal of bringing down the country\u2019s poverty rate to 14% in 2022 from 21.6% in 2015. But he thinks the government can do better.,\u201cThis is a huge promise and the government can be probably commended for putting it at that ambition level, but for us, it\u2019s still not ambitious enough. We want to see extreme poverty ended under the Duterte regime,\u201d said Serrano.,Is government funding the right infrastructure?,The P850-billion infrastructure budget seems poised to create more jobs and spur development in key parts of the country. But Serrano wonders if it\u2019s funding the kind of infrastructure that will bring about inclusive economic growth.,He pointed out that a majority of the infra budget is for road network services, not public transportation systems.,\u201cIf it\u2019s big infra, we want to see it in mass transit, in ports, because we are an archipelago so we want a development of the port system and then the train system. We don\u2019t want expansion of highways,\u201d said Serrano.,More highways create an incentive for car ownership which he said practically translates to \u201can indirect subsidy to the rich\u201d rather than the pro-poor public transit systems like trains and sea ports.,SWP also wanted to see more funds for light infrastructure: rural roads, electrification, and sanitation and water infrastructure.,Funds prone to abuse,While Duterte continues to sound the call against corruption, Serrano said one needs only to look at the 2017 budget to see windows of opportunity for abusive spending practices.,For instance, he criticized the \u201chighly discretionary\u201d ,intelligence and confidential funds, under the Office of the President, which posted a 400% increase compared to 2016.,Because of the sensitive nature of the funds, they can only be looked into by the Commission on Audit chairperson. But for Serrano, these funds can and should be explained after they are spent.,\u201cIn the pre-audit, maybe not, we can understand because that will compromise whatever plans they have. But after, there should be an accounting for it,\u201d he said.,Another red flag for Serrano is the supposed, pork barrel-like funds, for ARMM infrastructure projects that had been lodged in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).,The roughly P9-billion funds were questioned by Senator Panfilo Lacson to the point that come bicameral committee, members of the House of Representatives who pushed for the funds agreed to transfer the funds to the Commission on Higher Education for, free tuition, in state-run universities.,But SWP pointed out that, despite this move, DPWH was able to retain the P9 billion because of other additions to its budget. ,SWP shares ,Lacson\u2019s concern ,that this additional budget likely came from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (Calamity) Fund which experienced a large cut \u2013 ,from a proposed budget of P37.255 billion to a mere P15.755 billion in the signed 2017 budget law. That's a cut of P21.5 billion.,Serrano doesn\u2019t buy the House of Representatives' reasoning that just because projects are itemized means they are not prone to pork-like practices.,\u201cThis is probably all itemized, in that sense, it\u2019s not pork. But if they have a connection to the projects because they were the ones who proposed it and that\u2019s been pre-arranged with contractors, that\u2019s the thing worth watching,\u201d said Serrano.,With the budget allocated, citizens should be on the lookout for how government money is spent. Only the implementation of funded programs will show if the 2017 national budget helped fulfill President Duterte\u2019s promises to the people., \u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/159002-2017-national-budget-duterte-promises", "title": "A look at the 2017 budget: Will it help Duterte fulfill his promises?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/162309-manny-pacquiao-negotiations-amir-khan,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156276-duterte-signs-2017-budget,http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/146510-explainer-office-president-confidential-intelligence-funds"},

It allows scientists to edit, with pinpoint accuracy, stretches of the genome by removing, adding or changing pieces of the DNA sequence.,Major medical labs and biotechnology companies see the technique as having stunning potential.,But critics worry over ethical concerns, such as changing DNA within reproductive cells, because these tweaks will be passed on from generation to generation.,The 3 scientists were represented by lawyers at the court in Alexandria, Virginia for a hearing that lasted less than 50 minutes.,There is broad agreement that Charpentier and Doudna \u2013 winners of many prizes in the past four years \u2013 discovered this gene-editing technique that has raised so many hopes.,Their work was published in the journal ,Science, in June 2012. But they described using CRISPR with simple organisms such as bacteria. They filed for a patent in May 2012.,The Broad Institute, with Zhang, filed a patent request in December 2012 for a successful test of CRISPR with eukaryotes \u2013 more advanced organisms whose cells contain a nucleus with a membrane. ,This step forward opened up vast possibilities for extending gene-editing to human cells.,The question before the 3-judge panel Tuesday was whether Zhang benefited from the discovery of the other two scientists or was actually responsible for moving CRISPR forward as a technology.,\"Dr Zhang had already started to work on it prior to\" the publication of his rivals' work, said Steven Trybus, lawyer for the Broad Institute.,Quoting an interview that she gave, Trybus said Doudna \"experienced many frustrations trying to get it in human cells.\",A lawyer for the other side sought to dismiss any suggestion that his clients had failed.,Todd Walters, a lawyer for the University of California, said Doudna has granted hundreds of interviews and \"there is no statement in the record that she believed that it wouldn't work in eukaryotic cells.\",What will the judges do to attribute paternity for the discovery of the century in biotechnology?,They can decide that one side wins it all, or split things up by assigning some patents to both sides.,No decision is expected for weeks.

They threw paintball bombs at the wall of the military's main headquarters, which soldiers immediately washed away with water hoses. ,Inside Camp Aguinaldo, members of the Philippines and US panels met for the 7th round of talks.

(READ: ,Miriam: PH, US military deal needs Senate OK,),Treaty or not?,Both Philippine panel chairman Defense Undersecretary Pio Lorenzo Batino and US panel chairman Ambassador Eric John stressed that the agreement will be a mere implementation of the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). Signed in 1951, it's an agreement which states ,that the two countries shall separately and jointly develop capacity to resist an armed attack.,John said: \"The guiding principle of the negotiations is to enhance the effectiveness that we have through the implementation of this agreement of the long-standing Mutual Defense Treaty. I think that we\u2019ve seen over the last many decades the effectiveness of the MDT, but an agreement like this also proves the vibrancy of the MDT. It\u2019s something that can be strengthened through further implementing steps that we\u2019re taking here with this agreement.\",Batino explained that the agreement they are negotiating is meant to \"make adjustments in the implementation of the MDT, to ensure that our constitutional requirements are fully observed.\",'Temporary' bases,The Philippine panel has always intended the bases access deal to be an executive agreement. It was the US panel that initially raised concerns because they feared its legality would be questioned. But the Americans are apparently satisfied with the explanation of the Aquino government.,The government sought US assistance to develop \"minimum credible defense\" in the wake of the agressiveness of China in the West Philippines Sea (South China Sea). The request coincides with the US strategy to rebalance to the Pacific. While the Philippines is more concerned with defense cooperation, the US has been vocal about its economic interests in the region. ,Santiago explained that the bases access deal cannot be considered an implementation of the MDT.,\u201cI think they will argue the prior treaty is a Mutual Defense Treaty and they are just carrying out the details, but I will argue to the contrary. Posting the war powers, the war equipment of a foreign sovereign state in our territory is not a minor case of detail. It is a major subject in itself. It cannot be classified as an executive agreement but as a treaty to which the Philippine Senate must give its concurrence,\u201d the senator told reporters on March 14.,The \"temporary\" basing will have a duration of less than 20 years. ,The US will be allowed to construct facilities inside Philippine military bases, which can only be accessed by designated Philippine authorities. ,(READ details of the agreements ,here,.,) ,Trapped between 2 bullies,The militant groups said the bases access deal is a \"de facto basing agreement for US troops.\" They are also asking government to ,release to the public the draft it submitted to the US.

According to Dela Rosa, the SAF troopers will \u201cconduct tactical offensives against police scalawags.\u201d,Senior Superintendent Chiquito Malayo, former deputy chief of the PNP\u2019s Firearms and Explosives Office, will be its head. Malayo was the police chief of Zamboanga City when rogue Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters tried to seize the city.,The newly-created task force will be occupying the building that was once the Anti-Illegal Drugs Group (AIDG), which has since been ordered ,dismantled, by President Rodrigo Duterte himself.,Aside from the SAF, the task force will tap counter-intelligence operations from the PNP Intelligence GRoup and investigators from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group.,The creation of the task force comes at a rather trying time for the PNP.,Nearly 8 months into a popular but controversial war on drugs, Duterte ,ordered a stop, to all police anti-illegal drugs operations. Although the PNP has been hounded by allegations of abuse in the name of the drugs war, the tipping point seemed to have been the ,murder, ,of Korean national, Jee Ick Joo, allegedly by cops and National Bureau of Investigation operatives.,Police allegedly claimed they were conducting an anti-illegal drugs operation when Jee was taken from his home in Angeles City. He was killed the same day in front of the AIDG headquarters in Camp Crame.,The deadline of the task force\u2019s \u201cinternal cleansing\u201d efforts isn\u2019t quite clear just yet. In a speech, Dela Rosa said that with the PNP\u2019s cooperation, it might take as short as 1 month. Speaking to reporters a few days later, Dela Rosa said he wanted Malayo to get the job done before he retired in January 2018.,One thing\u2019s for sure, though. Malayo and his men and women will have a tough job ahead of them \u2013 \u201ccleansing\u201d the PNP of its black sheep at a time when many are beginning to doubt its mandate \u201cto protect and to serve.\u201d \u2013 ,Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/160544-task-force-police-scalawags-what-we-know", "title": "Task force vs police scalawags: What we know so far", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/171252-recap-manila-masters-eg-newbee-grand-finals,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130937-zamboanga-del-norte-jalosjos-assassination-try,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/middle-east/166303-united-states-missile-strike-syria,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/166307-rappler-talk-kadamay-occupy-pabahay-anarchy-just-cause,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159982-pnp-counter-intel-task-force-scalawag-cops,http://www.rappler.com/nation/159931-pnp-dela-rosa-stop-drug-operations-focus-cleansing"},
{"content": "\nWrites a retired Supreme Court justice: 'We don\u2019t need to change to a federal system but only push hard for decentralization to break up the concentration of power in the central government'    , ,Those calling for the change justify it by describing the object of change \u201cImperial Manila\u201d or worse \u201cImperialist Manila.\u201d Wikipedia defines the term as follows: \u201cImperial Manila is a pejorative epithet used by sectors of Philippine society and non-Manilans to express the idea that all the affairs of the Philippines, whether in politics, economy or culture, are decided by what goes on in the capital region, Metro Manila, without considering the needs of the rest of the country, largely because of centralized government and urbanite snobbery.\u201d,The once \"distinguished and ever loyal city\" of Manila must have become so hated that vivid metaphors have been employed to describe how it should be ended: \u201cDestroy Imperial Manila,\u201d \u201cCastrate Imperial Manila,\u201d and \u201cDecapitate Imperial Manila.\u201d,Complaint vs Imperial Manila,We have a unitary system of government, which in theory holds all power and from which all authority emanates. The complaint is that the power given to local governments is so little that they have failed to realize their fullest development as self reliant communities. With respect to public finance, the share of LGUs in the revenue from taxes, fees and charges collected by the government is fixed at 60-40 percent in favor of the central government. In addition, the complaint is that the age-old conflicts and secessionist movements in Mindanao continue to defy solution.,All these \u2013 the failure of the LGUs to develop and the seemingly insoluble conflict in Mindanao \u2013 have been laid at the doorstep of Imperial Manila.  ,Those calling for an end to Imperial Manila call for the federalization of the government as a means of breaking up its power and distributing it to several states so that there will be several centers of power throughout the nation. For this purpose the advocates propose the conversion of the 12 existing administrative regions into 11 states. For example, Region V, which is at present composed of Albay with Legazpi City, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, including the Cities of Naga and Iriga, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon will become the State of Bicol, to be composed of the same provinces and cities, minus Masbate.,Under a federal system, each of the states will be independent. Each will have its own constitution, its own government, and its own court system, in contrast to local governments which only exercise power given to them by the central government. ,Given the condition of the local government units, however, thoughtful citizens are asking whether we are ready for the federal system. Take for example the Bicol Region, is it ready for statehood? Dr. Jose V. Abueva, fervent advocate of federalism, estimates that ten years would be enough to make the proposed states viable. That does not seem to be a realistic estimate.  ,What federalization will entail,Each state, as I have said, will have to have its own constitution. This is necessary to give the states a sense that they are directors of their own political will and their political destiny. The state constitution should be prepared and approved by the local population in a plebiscite. Give the adoption of the state constitution three years. ,Each state must also have its own government, consisting of legislative, executive, and judicial branches, and hold elections for some of its officials. Give the organization of the government of the state another three years. ,Each state will have to have its own court system, with the jurisdiction of each court clearly defined, and provide for appeals to the National Supreme Court in some cases. The National Supreme Court will exercise original jurisdiction over interstate commerce and transportation and appellate jurisdiction over cases arising from or between the states which involve the application and interpretation of the Federal Constitution and the federal laws. Give the establishment of a state court system and the appellate or review processes up to the national level another three years. This matter should be given careful study. Much of the business of the US Supreme Court consists of adjudicating cases involving diversity of jurisdiction because of its dual court system.,That already is a total of nine years. But what about the training of leaders in public policy, since each state is now going to determine its policies? What about the development of its economy, how long will it take to grow the region so that each state can stand on its own two feet? What about preparing people for the duties and responsibilities of statehood, all cast in the context of duties and responsibilities to the broader Nation? More than the amendment of the Constitution is the amendment of men\u2019s nature. This is likely to take a much longer period, not just years but perhaps a whole generation or several epochs.,Curiously, the ten-year period is similar to the ten-year transition period given by America to Filipinos before the grant of independence to them.When well-meaning leaders doubted whether ten years would be sufficient to prepare Filipinos for independence, President Quezon said dismissively, \u201cI prefer a government run like hell by Filipinos to a government run like heaven by Americans.\u201d But can we dismiss apprehensions about changing the system of government when it also calls for changing the mindset and habits of thinking of people who for over a 100 years have not known of any regime but unitary system? ,Indeed, the whole process of federalization will involve dividing governmental powers between the national government, on the one hand, and the several states on the other. The national government will have power over matters of national concern, like foreign relations, national security, immigration, citizenship and naturalization, postal service, monetary currency, interstate commerce and transportation and communication. The state governments will take charge of local matters like peace and order, trade and commerce, taxation, natural resources, etc. It will be splitting the atom of sovereignty in order to produce several nuclei, this can be done in ten years? ,Proposed federalization, a reverse process, ,This process of federalization as proposed is in the opposite historical direction of the formation of federal states. Federal systems are usually the results either of the agreement of several states to form a union or of the organization of several territories or colonies into a federal system by a colonial power. , For example, the United States of America was formed out of 13 colonies which, after declaring their independence from Great Britain in 1776, formed a confederation or \u201cperpetual Union\u201d and, when this proved to be weak, adopted the present US Constitution which provides for the present federal system of government.,Another example is the Federation of Malaysia, which was formed out of several separate units or territories held successively by Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. In 1944, the British government tried to organize them (except Singapore) into a single state, the Malayan Union, but strong opposition forced it to abandon the plan. Instead, on February 1, 1948 the Federation of Malaya, which later became the present Federation of Malaysia, was formed.,The creation in reverse of a Federal Republic of the Philippines is likely to bring about a host of undesirable effects, to wit:,At a time when regional federations are breaking up and threats to our territorial integrity are getting to be more real than imagined, is there truly a need to divide the government into national and state governments? ,Decentralization is the way,Indeed, in classic political theory, concentration of power is never an issue against a unitary system of government. ,In Federalist Paper No. 51 Madison saw the vertical division of power between national and state governments, along with its horizontal division into legislative, executive and judicial, as providing double protection for individual rights. Similarly, Lord Acton, wary of absolute power, thought that \u201cby multiplying the centers of government and discussion [federalism becomes] . . . the protectorate of minorities, and the consecration of self-government.\u201d Protection of individual rights was thus a reason for federalism. ,On the other hand, Dean Roscoe Pound saw federalism as the only way for governing a large country of continental extent, like the United States, by which national policies can be fully realized by permitting regional variations according to local needs. The effective administration of a continental domain was another purpose of federalism. ,No one, however, has advocated federalism as a cure for the concentration of powers per se. ,The truth is that we don\u2019t really have a fully centralized unitary government, but one with a decentralized system of local governments. Local autonomy is a constitutional policy and decentralization a constitutional mandate. Both are rights of local governments which cannot be taken away from them. Local officials are elected, not appointed by the central government, and their tenure is guaranteed. They have the power to create their own sources of revenue and raise taxes. They have a right to share in the taxes, charges and fees collected by the central government as well in the utilization and development of natural resources within their areas.  ,Senator Aquilino Q. Pimentel Jr. argues that a federal state would enable Moros to run their government according to their customs and traditions. The Constitution already provides for autonomous regions in the Cordilleras and Muslim Mindanao with recognition of the fact that the people of these regions have a different historical and cultural heritage and different economic and social structures. Autonomous regions have their own organic acts, their own government, consisting of an executive department and legislative assembly, and special courts with personal, family and property law jurisdiction. No reason has been shown why these provisions for autonomous regions are inadequate to address the Mindanao problem. If the Bangsamoro Basic Law failed passage in the last Congress, it was because several of its provisions were perceived to be unconstitutional and that what it provided for was the creation of a Bangsamoro substate.,The argument that federalization will promote local development and encourage citizen participation in government is precisely a policy argument for decentralization. In 1967 Congress enacted the Decentralization Act (R.A. No. 5185) granting \u201clocal governments greater freedom and ampler means to respond to the needs of their people and promote their prosperity and happiness and to effect a more equitable and systematic distribution of governmental powers and resources.\u201d Thus, \u201cthe performance of those functions that are more properly administered [at] the local level\u201d are entrusted to local governments which are granted \u201cas much autonomous powers and financial resources as are required for the more effective discharge of these responsibilities.\u201d,The coming into force of the 1987 Constitution added impetus to the decentralization of the government. It mandates Congress to \u201cenact a local government code which shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization.\u201d The Local Government Code (R.A. 7160), provides in its Section 3 \u201cOperative Principles of Decentralization\u201d in passing local legislation. If then there is still excessive concentration of power in the central government, it is because constitutional and statutory provisions for decentralization have not been fully implemented. ,We have reduced the President\u2019s power over local governments to \u201cgeneral supervision.\u201d We need to do something similar to Congress\u2019 powers over local legislation to implement fully the constitutional policy of local autonomy. There should be not merely decentralization of local administration and functions but delegation of legislative powers, to give local governments greater autonomy. They should have power to determine what ordinances to enact, subject only to such terms and conditions as Congress may provide, with a sufficient standard to guide them in the exercise of this power. This is permissible under the Constitution. It is in fact a mandate to Congress with respect to local governments. In addition, the share of local governments in the internal revenue collection should be increased from 60-40, in favor of the national government, to 30-70, in favor of local governments given the increased responsibilities that they will now shoulder.,This is not the same as federalizing the government. Power will not be granted to the local governments as independent entities but simply delegated to them as political subdivisions of the state. National policies will still be determined by the central government, but local governments will be given broad discretion to make variations to adapt them to local conditions.,All these can be done without changing to a federal system and without having to amend or revise the Constitution, which is problematical because of controversy in the interpretation of its Amendment Clause. ,For, indeed, apart from the risks of failure of the experiment, there are procedural problems to be considered as well. ,Vexing problem,It is generally agreed that to change from a unitary to a federal system would require the revision of the Constitution.  Revisions of the Constitution can be proposed either by Congress acting as a constituent assembly or by a constitutional convention composed of delegates elected by the people. While the President had originally expressed preference for a constitutional convention, it was subsequently announced that he chose a Con-Ass to undertake the job of overhauling the Constitution after being told of the cost of holding a Con-Con. ,This decision is likely to raise anew a vexing problem that has been with us since the adoption of the Constitution in 1987: how the two Houses of Congress, when acting as a constituent assembly, should sit, whether jointly or separately. The Constitution\u2019s meager provision gives no answer to this question. Its Article XVII, Section 1 simply states that \u201cAny amendment to, or revision of, this Constitution may be proposed by (1) The Congress, upon a vote of three-fourths of all its Members.\u201d,In the last Congress, views were expressed that in amending the Constitution so as to change some of its economic provisions, Congress could follow the same procedure for enacting bills. ,This problem has arisen because the constitutional provision in question was originally written on the assumption that the legislative body would be unicameral. However, toward the closing days of its session, the Commission decided to have a bicameral Congress instead. Accordingly, the relevant provisions of the draft Constitution, except the Amendment Clause, were rewritten to reflect the change.,Thus, in the following cases, it was provided that the two Houses of Congress must meet in joint session but vote separately:,It was only through oversight that the Commission failed to make the corresponding changes in the Amendment Clause. But, as  Commissioner Suarez, the Chairman of the Committee on Amendments and Transitory Provisions, said when asked what his committee would do in the event the Commission decided to have a bicameral legislative body, they would include the words \u201cIN JOINT SESSION ASSEMBLED.\u201d  ,Indeed, if Congress is required to meet in joint session but vote separately in performing the functions just enumerated, it stands to reason it must be required to observe this same procedure when performing its highest function of amending or revising the fundamental law. To contend that Congress can propose amendments to the Constitution in the same way as in passing ordinary legislation is to forget the lesson of Marbury v. Madison that \u201cas a superior paramount law, the Constitution is unchangeable by ordinary legislative acts.\u201d ,There is furthermore a benefit to be gained by having Senators and Representatives meet and discuss matters together face to face. As the Supreme Court has pointed out, the \u201cSenators and members of the House of Representatives act, not as members of Congress, but as component elements of a constituent assembly.\u201d (Gonzales v. Comelec, 21 SCRA 774, 785 (1967); Tolentino v. Comelec, 41 SCRA 702, 714 (1971)). ,To sum up, we don\u2019t need to change to a federal system but only push hard for decentralization to break up the concentration of power in the central government, and therefore we don\u2019t need to amend or revise the Constitution. And if Congress has to act at all as a constituent assembly, its two Houses must meet in joint session but vote separately. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ,The author is a retired justice of the Philippines\u2019 Supreme Court and a professor of constitutional law at the UP College of Law., , , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/148718-federalism-not-the-answer", "title": "Why federalism is not the answer", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out"},

It's all right \u2013 I've been there too many times to count    , ,I quit smoking in February 2016 \u2013 almost 15 years after I bought my first pack. If I were to do the math, I could say that I've puffed half of my life away.,What started out as an attempt to fit in with older, seemingly more sophisticated peers in college developed into a full-blown habit. I've written about my failed attempts to ,quit smoking a few years ago,, but did not find the resolve to quit for good until much later.,Some of you may be going through the same struggle. You know it's not good for you, but you're stuck in a cycle of feeling deprived and craving and relapsing. It's all right \u2013 I've been there too many times to count.,I've been asked how I managed to kick the habit for good, so I thought I'd share it with those who are trying to do the same thing. Note, however, that each person has a different way of coping \u2013 what worked for me may not necessarily work for you.,1. Going cold turkey,. There is no other way. I was down with the flu when I had my annual physical exam in December 2015, and a month after, the results came out., ,The reading said, \"Suspicious mass on upper left lung.\" I was advised to see a doctor for further examinations. Thankfully, the anomaly was just because of the bad flu, but was good enough as a wake-up call. If that doesn't jolt you, I don't know what will.,2. (Temporarily) ditch your friends who smoke. ,I get it, you love your friends. You've been busy with work, and meeting up with them is a great respite from work. But if you're trying to quit, and your friends happen to smoke, you may want to take some time off from them. , ,You will be at your most vulnerable 3 to 6 months from the day you stopped smoking, and a relapse may just happen. Caveat: If you think you'll hurt their feelings, you can choose not to tell them the cold, hard truth about your absence from ,barkada ,nights out. Just say you've been busy, which isn't exactly a lie. ,3. Change your routine. ,Smoking is built around a habit, which may or may not be a greater addiction than nicotine. I'm a stickler for a regimented lifestyle, so the adage \"old habits die hard\" fits to a T. , ,There are two stairwells leading up to my apartment. One leads to the clubhouse, another to a fork in the road leading to more apartment buildings. My routine before going to the newsroom consists of going down the clubhouse-bound stairwell, booking a car, and smoking a stick or two while I wait.,During the first week of my no-smoking challenge, I switched things up a bit. I would go down the other stairwell, and wait for the car by the fork in the road. When I got more comfortable with my new routine, I incorporated more changes, such as joining a non-smoking colleague for lunch. Those little changes in my routine helped my resolve to keep going, until passing by the smoking area no longer triggers the urge to puff.,4. Get busy. ,Or busier. The day I quit smoking coincided with the beginning of the campaign season. As a producer for Rappler, I had to deal with new workflows that had to be put in place and help manage the influx of material from reporters and videographers on the ground. It was more than usual, and the energy I was expending on top of adjusting to my new smoke-free lifestyle was exhausting., ,But that was a blessing in disguise. I no longer had to light up a couple of sticks to put me to sleep at the end of the day. When your body's recalibrating because of the energy you're expending, sleep comes to you much easier.,5. Download a tracking app. ,Not only can you track how many days it has been since you made the resolve to quit, you also get to review all the money you saved from not smoking., ,At Day 476, I managed to save P19,100, since I used to smoke half a pack each day on the average. I recommend the ,LiveStrong MyQuit Coach, or ,Quit That, apps if you have other vices you want to add on top of smoking \u2013 sugar, alcohol, or a toxic relationship. ,6. Involve the people around you. ,As mentioned in #4, I quit smoking in the thick of the election season. I was spending most of my time with my colleagues. My boss, a non-smoker, was especially helpful \u2013 she made sure I stayed on track and cautioned me from unhealthy diversions, such as eating too much., ,There is a sense of motivation if your colleagues and loved ones are involved in your resolve to kick the habit. For one, it would be a shame to disappoint them, and it's great to have people supporting you, whether as cheerleaders or drill sergeants.,7. Indulge yourself. ,Try to be as comfortable as possible during the first few months of being smoke-free. If you feel exhausted, go get a massage or book a spa appointment. Be kind to yourself; weaning yourself from an addiction can be daunting., ,Another good thing about quitting smoking is that you have more disposable income. Go shop for new clothes, or treat yourself to your favorite, fancier-than-usual meal. You deserve it.,8. Work towards a goal. ,Whether it's saving up for that trip to Japan with your family, running a marathon, or starting a small business, your resolve to quit a habit that you struggled to break free for years is just the beginning. For me, being able to quit after almost 15 years is empowering., ,At the risk of sounding condescending, I urge you to quit \u2013 not tomorrow, not later, but now. The first few months are the most taxing, when migraines and mood swings get the best of you, but when your skin clears up, and you have greater stamina while getting through your day, you will realize that it's all worth it. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/marga-deona/170011-how-to-quit-smoking-for-good", "title": "How to quit smoking \u2013 for good", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/159433-declining-broadband-prices-then-and-now,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/19148-confessions-of-a-struggling-nicotine-dependent"},

Of the amount, P500 million was allotted to the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, P1 million to the National Telecommunications Commission, and the remaining P150 million to the OP itself as part of its expenses for general management and supervision.,In the last 4 years of the administration of then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the combined CF and IF budget was around P650 million. Under former president Benigno Aquino III, the budget for CF and IF was constantly set at P500 million, except for 2011, when it was at P400 million.,For 2017, however, the combined CF and IF allotment is only 12.48% of the total OP budget, which is lower by at least 2.8 percentage points compared to previous years.,In an email to Rappler, the DBM Media Office said that these confidential and intelligence funds would be used \"mainly for President Rodrigo R. Duterte\u2019s war against drugs, criminality and corruption.\",\"The increased efforts of the President naturally requires an increase in resources,\" it added, with a comment that in the past, the annual budget for these funds \"was disbursed without any visible results.\",The DBM also said that the CF and IF are subject to review by the Commission on Audit.,For her part, former COA chief Grace Pulido-Tan said that auditors would rely on the reports and documents that the agencies, including the OP, submit.,Because of the nature of these funds, details of where they actually go may not be fully disclosed to the public. (WATCH: ,Confidential, intel funds difficult to audit \u2013 ex-COA chair,),Guidelines,Nonetheless, Joint Circular No. 2015-01 provides for guidelines regarding the use of these funds.,According to the said circular, confidential funds can only be used for the following:,Meanwhile, intelligence funds can be used only by uniformed, military personnel and intelligence practitioners in these cases:,The CF and IF cannot be used to pay salaries and other benefits, representation or consultancy fees, or for the construction/acquisition of buildings or houses.,The disbursement or release of these funds must be supported by documentary evidence of payment and a certification (signed under oath) of the officer accountable for these funds.

Their use of CF is subject to approval by the concerned Cabinet secretary or head of agency. But the release of intelligence funds must be approved first by the President.,Local goverment units (LGU) that have peace and order as a primary concern are also entitled to have confidential funds, but not intelligence funds. The CF's release and use should be approved by two-thirds of the LGU's peace and order council.

{"content": "\nThe Philippines should join the UK and Japan in calling for a more focused development agenda. Otherwise, we may not able to prioritize actions to ensure that 'no one is left behind.'\n, ,The SDGs put forward a shared vision of where we want to see the world to be in 2030, in terms of economic, social, environmental, and governance conditions, with statistics to be produced by member states in 2015 to serve as baselines for monitoring progress.,At the close of the millennium 15 years ago, 189 UN members adopted the Millennium Declaration which committed humanity to poverty reduction and related goals. The following year, the UN Secretary General\u2019s Road Map for implementing the Millennium Declaration formally defined eight goals, supported by 18 quantified and time-bound targets by 2015, and 48 statistical indicators, which subsequently became known as the MDGs.,For instance, for poverty reduction, the goal was to reduce by half the proportion of people in extreme poverty from 1990 to 2015, with one of the indicators for measuring this poverty reduction goal and this specific target as the percentage of the population with incomes less than $1 a day (in 1990 prices, or $1.25 in 2005 prices).,The number of targets and indicators for monitoring the MDGS were subsequently further expanded to 21 targets and 60 indicators (see Table 1). ,Table 1. Number of MDG Targets and Indicators per Goal,MDGs,Number of Targets,Number of Indicators,MDGs,Number of Targets,Number of Indicators,  , , , , , , , ,Source: ,UN,The MDGs set forth a framework for global aid discussions, and provided an agenda not only for the world and its member states, but also within countries. Across the world, progress has been observed in many of the MDGs, especially in reducing extreme poverty, and in improving access to education and health services.,The first of the MDGs on poverty reduction has been achieved ahead of the 2015 deadline: the proportion of people with incomes less than $1.25 a day (in 2005 prices) in 2010 (18 percent) was already half the 1990 proportion (36 percent). Despite population growth, 700 million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty in 2010 than in 1990.  Still, over a billion (1.2 billion) people are living in extreme poverty.,The UN, in its ,MDG Report 2014,, noted that aside from achieving the extreme poverty reduction target ahead of the 2015 deadline, the world has also already met its targets on access to safe drinking water and improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers. In addition, the targets on gender equality in primary and secondary education and the incidence of malaria are projected to be met by 2015, although gender disparity was noted to be still prevalent in higher levels of education. In addition, results have been observed in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis globally.  ,Hunger, child undernutrition, and child mortality also have continued to decline.  Across the world, the political participation of women has continued to rise. Primary school participation and access to improved sanitation has also risen. ,Uneven progress, ,But while much progress on the MDGs has been achieved, the rate of progress has been very uneven across regions, across countries, and across the Goals. ,Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of development challenges with continuing food insecurity, very high child and maternal mortality, a large number of people living in informal settlements, an increase in extreme poverty, and an overall shortfall in attaining a majority of the MDGs.,Latin America, the transition economies, as well as the Middle East and North Africa, have shown slow or no progress on some of the MDGs,with persistent (and even rising) inequalities  preventing progress on attaining other MDGs. Asia has yielded the fastest progress in reducing poverty and improving access to social services, and yet, even in Asia, the number of people living in extreme poverty are in the hundreds of millions of people.,Figure 1. ,Extent of progress toward achieving the MDGs, by number of countries,. ,  ,In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), many member states have either had low poverty headcount rates since the 1990s, or reduced rates of the proportion of people in extreme poverty.  ,From the mid-1990s to 2010, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia have shown dramatic improvements in welfare conditions, especially as these countries have been experiencing considerable economic growth as well as implementing a number of successful pro-poor programs. ,Indonesia, in particular, has implemented both a conditional cash transfer (CCT) and an unconditional cash transfer.,In contrast, the proportion of people in extreme poverty has been at a practical standstill in the Philippines.,Trends in the lack of changes in poverty headcounts from 2006-2012, ,whether using the country\u2019s official poverty lines, or the international poverty lines ($1.25 per person per day), have actually been quite similar. Thus achieving the first of the MDG targets on reducing extreme poverty and hunger by this year 2015 to half their levels in 1990 is close to impossible for the Philippines. ,More recent poverty data from another survey instrument for the first semesters of 2013 and 2014 suggest reportedly a rise in poverty, but actually, a more careful reading of the ,press release, of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) suggests that there was no change in the poverty rate. But because the 2014 survey did not include respondents in the province of Leyte (which was hit hardest by supertyphoon Yolanda), the national poverty rate is likely to be even higher than was estimated by the PSA.,Thus, the Philippines has yet to ensure that its recent economic growth benefits everyone.  The ,wealthiest Filipinos, whose wealth continues to rise will need to make more investments in the country that will ultimately assure sustained growth and progress.,Figure 2: ,Trends in Headcount Poverty Rates across selected ASEAN countries: 1980-2011.,  ,Unfinished agenda,In the Philippines, there is ,evidence, that some poor actually manage to exit from poverty, but for every poor who does exit poverty, there is about one non-poor who falls into poverty (likely from shocks of impacts of natural calamities, rising prices of food, loss of jobs, etc.), so the challenge is to set up social protection not only for the poor, but also for the nearly poor who can easily fall into poverty. ,Although a fast-growing country like the Philippines will very likely not achieve its MDG targets on poverty reduction, and also on malnutrition, maternal mortality, reducing HIV/AIDS, but it will achieve some MDG targets on ,primary education for all, gender equality, sanitation and infant mortality,. ,Improvements in school participation appear to have been result of the government\u2019s investments in addressing input deficits (classrooms, teachers, tables, chairs) with increases in budgets for the Department of Education (DepED), as well as in ,Pantawid Pamilya, (our CCT) appear to be paying off with far fewer children of school going age who are out of school.  With improved education attainments of children from poor families, it is expected that when these children join the labor market, incomes will likely be higher than what they would have had with less education. ,In this end year for the MDGs, while much has been achieved, there is an unfinished development agenda even for the MDG targets that have been met.,Thus discussion on the SDGs has taken shape, with the UN Open Working Group on SDGs proposing double the number of Goals tin the MDGs (17 goals). Within the 17 proposed goals (see Table 2), there would be even much more targets (169) than the MDG targets, and likely there will be at least 300 statistical indicators to monitor for the SDGs.    ,Table 2. Proposed Sustainable Development Goals,Source: ,United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform,While undoubtedly, the MDGs was limited in scope, e.g., it did not cover targets on inequality  and it was more concerned about poverty issues than a much broader framework, the current proposal on the SDGs is going overboard with too many goals that will likely undermine a clear focus for a development agenda, whether at the global, regional or country level. ,The MDGs suffered from the lack of consensus on the targets and indicators, with a mere expert group from international organizations defining all the targets and goals. In contrast, the UN conducted many \u201cglobal conversations,\u201d which included 11 thematic and 83 national consultations, and even door-to-door surveys. It also conducted an online My World survey asking people to prioritize the areas they\u2019d like to see addressed in the SDGs.,In 2013, the Open Working Group on SDG even invited official statisticians (that then included myself) to an ,informal meeting, regarding measuring progress, which opened the doors for further discussions with official statisticians.  Still, official statisticians have not managed to influence the Open Working Group into keeping things simple.  ,Setting priorities,The current proposal on the SDGs may have been spoiled by too many cooks, as it does not provide guidance to prioritize targets, but leaves it to regions and countries to to have a roadmap for prioritizing and attaining the SDGs according to context.,Past experience on MDG targeting, however, suggests that country capacities to identify targets are weak. ,For instance, the Philippines defined a target to halve poverty rates from 1990, when this was very aspirational and did not take account of historical trends that would have suggested that this is going to be an extra challenge. In Myanmar, baseline indicators on poverty were from 2005, rather than 1990, and yet the government adopted a target to reduce poverty rates in 2015 to half the baselines, when the whole world used 1990 baselines, again making this more an aspirational than a realistic target.,It can also be observed that many of the proposed SDG targets are more of political statements than measureable achievements. Beyond the goals and targets for the SDGs, statistics will need to be identified, and more importantly, there will be a need to provide funds to sustain statistics for the SDGs, whether by governments or donors.  ,Sadly, even for the 60 MDG indicators, between half to two thirds of these statistics have been produced in ASEAN member states, and likely, for countries with less development and less statistical capacity, the availability of MDG statistics is not as good as in ASEAN (see Table 3).  How then can we monitor what we do not measure, especially for countries in more need of development?,Table 3. Total MDG Indicators Produced in Selected ASEAN member nations ,Country,MDG Indicators,Total Indicators,Total produced by NSO,Total produced by others,Cambodia,32,20,12,Indonesia,48,28,20,Malaysia,33,15,18,Myanmar,49,3,46,Philippines,42,18,24,Thailand,54,6,48,Vietnam,32,19,13,Sources: National Statistics Offices (NSOs) of Select ASEAN Countries ,The UK Prime Minister ,David Cameron,, who co-chaired a ,High Level Panel,, that authored a report to discuss a post 2015 Development Agenda, has suggested trimming down the SDG targets to around ten.   ,Japan also is not happy about the current proposal. It will be important that the Philippines joins the UK and Japan in calling for a more focused development agenda. Otherwise, we may not able to prioritize actions to ensure that \u201cno one is left behind.\u201d, \u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/87791-sustainable-development-mdg-sdg", "title": "Sustainable goals: From the MDGs to the SDGs", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/139638-encantadia-2016-cast-photos-grand-press-con,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/84833-poverty-inequality-data,http://www.rappler.com/business/214-who-s-who/85686-filipinos-forbes-billionaires-list-2015"},

The nearning deadline of the Millennium Development Goals leaves a question on the future of hunger and poverty. Graphic by Mara Mercado,MANILA, Philippines, \u2013 Hunger and poverty still exist globally despite the nearing expiration of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2015.,The United Nations, together with Open Working Group (OWG,) proposed the ,Sustainable Development Goals, as answer to the need to further strengthen the fight against problems brought about by poverty and hunger.,The SDGs, also called the Zero Draft, consist of 17 items geared towards universal application by considering the different realities, capacities, and development levels each country is facing.  ,The recent list contains goals ranging from ending poverty and attaining gender equality to even addressing the problem of climate change. (Read: ,In our response to the Arctic, we will be judged by posterity,),Leaders around the world are challenged to coincide their policy-making responsibilities with these goals throughout the 15-year duration before 2030.,Global arena,Unlike the MDGs that focused on developing countries, the SDGs will be put in a global agenda, but still taking into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of each nation.,OWG said in a statement that they \"affirm that there are different approaches, visions, models and tools available to each country, in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities, to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions\".,The group also recognized the importance of the development of goals which are rendered useful for establishing actions on sustainable development that are coherent and focused.,Zero Draft was developed as agreed upon during the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) last June 2012. ,The Philippines is not part of the ,Asia-Pacific Group, of OWG that helped draft the list. ,State of MDGs,The ,2013 MDG Report, shows that several targets have either already been achieved or are within reach.,From 47% in 1990, the number of people surviving with less than $1.25 a day in developing countries went down to 22% in 2010. Meanwhile, undernourished people decreased to 14% in 2012 from 23% in 1992.,Despite major progress, one in every 8 people still go to bed with an empty stomach.,According to the report, there is also not much progress in the eradication of maternal deaths despite it being preventable. From 1990 to 2010, ,maternal mortality, declined by 47% yet it falls short of the goal of reducing deaths by three quarters.,The United Nations explained that attaining the MDG target requires \u201caccelerated interventions and stronger political backing\u201d for women and children.,Meanwhile, the recent disasters that struck the Philippines were seen as hindrances in achieving MDGs, specifically targets associated with maternal and child welfare.

Poe's numbers are making LP allies think she's the ideal vice president for Mar Roxas. File photo by Bobby Lagsa/Rappler   ,GRACE POE,The wooing of Poe, who is barely halfway through her first term as senator, is the most public among those being considered. President Benigno Aquino III himself ,met with Poe, at least 4 times in the past few months, with at least two of those meetings with Roxas in attendance.,Although it was never explicitly said to her, Poe admitted in an interview that it seemed as though Aquino was eyeing her to be ,Roxas\u2019 running mate,.,Roxas himself said in a chance interview on August 1 that Poe was still ,part of his shortlist, for vice president.,Poe ran as an independent during the 2013 midterm elections but campaigned alongside the ruling Liberal Party, even donning the party\u2019s trademark yellow in some of its ads. She topped the senatorial race that year. ,But the senator says she wants to ,remain independent, in 2016, should she seek a higher national post.,One of the roadblocks to persuading Poe to forgo the presidency for 2016 and slide down to vice president, if LP allies and sources are to be believed, is Senator Francis Escudero, who is eyeing a higher post come 2016.,The two allies, however, have stated that they are still going to be independent of each other when it comes to their plans for 2016. Thus LP allies are still ,not giving up, on wooing Poe to be Roxas\u2019s running mate, pointing out that it would be a dream tandem.,The idea, LP sources said, is for 12 years of \u201c,Daang Matuwid,,\u201d the current administration\u2019s tagline for its transparency, good governance, and anti-corruption drive. Aquino, in his last State of the Nation Address, said it was possible for the country to reach First World status should his reforms continue.,Aquino remains hopeful that Poe and Escudero would join the \"unified\" ticket in 2016.,\"We are still hoping. We still want to have that very unified group that will preserve the coalition as much as possible that can ensure the victory of the agenda,\" Aquino told reporters on Monday, August 3.,The President warned of the dangers of having a divided coalition and said it might lead to the opposition's victory.,\",Pero kapag naghati tayo nang naghati nang naghati, baka naman maging manipis na manipis 'yung lamang at doon manganib lahat 'yung pinaghirapan natin,,\" Aquino said.,(But if we continue to be divided, we might end up having slim lead over the others.

Aquino III endorses Leni Rebredo, then the Liberal Party congressional candidate for the 3rd District of Camarines Sur in the 2013 elections. File photo by Jay Morales/Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau   ,LENI ROBREDO,Robredo, much like Poe, is a fairly new face in Philippine politics. It was only after the tragic passing of her husband, the late DILG secretary ,Jesse Robredo,, that she entered the fray.,The Camarines Sur representative was among the hundreds of politicians who trooped to Club Filipino on July 31 to witness Aquino\u2019s endorsement of Roxas.,The ties between the two go beyond the political. Roxas was a close friend of Robredro\u2019s from Roxas's time as Department of Trade and Industry chief and Jesse Robredo's term as mayor of Naga City.,Roxas, said the congresswoman\u2019s daughter Aika on social media, was jokingly referred to by Leni Robredo as Jesse\u2019s \u201csecond wife.\u201d,The interior secretary played a prominent role in 2012, when the plane that Jesse Robredo was in crashed off the coast of Masbate. Then secretary of transportation, Roxas himself oversaw rescue and later, retrieval operations.,\u201cHe was the very first cabinet secretary who gave Mama a call when Papa's plane was missing, who kept updating us on a regular basis during the search, and was also the first to let us know when it was found,\u201d wrote Aika in an Instagram post.,Roxas eventually took over the DILG.,According to a source close to Aquino, the Camarines Sur representative is \u201cbeing considered\u201d to be Roxas\u2019 running mate.,\u201cAnd she\u2019s open to it,\u201d the source, who is in talks with both Robredo and the LP, added.,Robredo however has said in previous interviews that she has not been offered anything and that she's only learned about the likelihood of her running with Roxas in newspaper reports.,Members of the LP, Aquino's cousin, Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino included, are apparently inclined toward Robredo. ,Click here, to go back.,File photo by Mark Cristino/Rappler Mark Cristino Mark Cristino Mark Cristino,ALAN PETER CAYETANO,A source close to Cayetano has also confirmed to Rappler that he is likewise being considered as Roxas\u2019s running mate. \"They're comfortable with each other,\" the source said.,The Roxas camp has also studied Cayetano's survey numbers, and they seem convinced that he can beat Escudero in the vice presidential race.,\"Besides, Alan will hold no punches in exposing Escudero,\" the source added.,In recent months, Cayetano has been known to the public for leading the Senate Blue Ribbon sub-committee\u2019s probe into corruption allegations against opposition standard-bearer Vice President Jejomar Binay.,Cayetano has also been known for his staunch stand against the proposed ,Bangsamoro Basic Law, (BBL), which is being pushed by Aquino.,It\u2019s one of the reasons why the President himself is not sold on the idea of Cayetano as Roxas\u2019 running mate, the source conceded.,It does not help, the source admitted, that Cayetano has harsh words for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which signed the peace deal with the government), at the height of the Mamasapano crisis.,Cayetano even chided the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process during Senate hearings for \u201c,defending,\u201d the MILF.,\u201cWhat side are you representing in the peace panel? Are you representing the Republic of the Philippines or are you representing the MILF?\u201d an angry Cayetano said in February.,The senator also got into a ,verbal tussle, with Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Governor Mujiv Hataman when Cayetano insisted on calling the MILF as terrorist organization.

{"content": "\nA former Rappler intern tells us about his memorable trip to Bangkok, Thailand    ,PLACE OF PIETY. These are some of the life-sized statues of Buddha inside Wat Pho. All photos by David Lozada,MANILA, Philippines - In November 2012, I was in Bangkok, Thailand to attend an international youth forum for ASEAN youth. Luckily, I had enough time to explore the capital of Thailand.,1. Wats,\"Wat\" is the Thai term for \"temple.\" Being a predominantly Buddhist country, Bangkok has lots of temples scattered all throughout the city. I was fortunate enough to visit two of the more important ones. ,Wat Phra Kaew, is also known as the ,Temple of the Emerald Buddha,. This is said to be the most important temple in Thailand. The main feature of this temple is the small statue of Buddha carved out from a single jade (not emerald) rock. Illustrations of the life of Buddha fill the interior of the temple. Photos were not allowed to be taken inside.,The second temple we visited was the famous ,Wat Pho, or the ,Temple of the Reclining Buddha,. It cost around 100 Baht (US$3) per person to enter the temple. For children, the entrance fee is half the price. ,THE RECLINING BUDDHA. This structure stands 15 meters high and is 43 meters long,I had always wanted to see the Reclining Buddha and so I was very excited to enter the temple. I was awed when I finally saw the structure: it was gigantic and gold-plated. Visitors weren\u2019t allowed to touch it. ,I found out that the Reclining Buddha wasn\u2019t the only attraction of Wat Pho. There were smaller temples and hundreds of life-sized Buddha statues around the compound.,The temple dress code:,When in Bangkok, one should never miss the chance to visit one or two Buddhist temples. They are good windows into understanding Buddhism and Thai culture more.,2. The Grand Palace,NATIONAL SYMBOL. The Grand Palace is used during official ceremonies and state functions,As part of the forum activities, we also visited the ,Grand Palace. ,The current King of Thailand resides in another palace; but the Grand Palace is still used during official ceremonies and functions.,GRAND, INDEED. The structure at the back is one of the gold-plated temples inside the Grand Palace,The structure was very beautiful and traditional. Almost all of it was gold-plated. All throughout the Palace, we saw giant soldier-like structures. According to my student liaison Isaraporn Kitcholwiwat, these structures were the \u201cprotectors\u201d of the Palace.,WELL-GUARDED. Dozens of these statues 'guard' the temple compound,Aside from the gigantic structures, there were also life-sized half-human-half-animal statues. These were the \u201canimal spirits\u201d that frolic around the Palace.,I wasn\u2019t required to pay any amount to enter the Grand Palace ,since it was part of the forum activities. Based on the signage, though, entrance costs around 500 Baht  (US$17) for foreign tourists and is free for Thais.,3. Shopping,Bangkok is also known as one of the shopping capitals of Southeast Asia. I personally think that it\u2019s because everything is relatively cheaper there than in the Philippines (this is aside from the fact that there are shopping malls and markets almost everywhere).,MBK. Taking a photo break while shopping with some co-delegates and friends,MBK, is one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest) shopping centers in Bangkok. It has 6 floors, each floor selling one type of product (i.e. 2nd floor \u2013 gadgets, 5th floor \u2013 shoes). Here, you can haggle to get lower prices. T-shirts are sold at 150 Baht but you can get them for 100 Baht if you buy two or three. Thai silk scarves are at 300 Baht but if you\u2019re good at haggling, you can get them for as low as half the price.,I only happened to pass by ,Siam Paragon, and ,Siam Discovery, so I cannot really say too much about them. What I do know, however, is that these are the malls where the branded and high-class (at least in Siam Discovery) stores are. This is also where one will find fine Thai restaurants.,MINIATURE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE. Near the food court of Terminal 21, you\u2019ll see San Francisco\u2019s famous landmark,Terminal 21, is unique. It is designed like the entire mall is an airport and every floor has a specific country theme. It is full of branded shops and miniature replicas of different international landmarks. The food court here is a good place to experience different cuisines, with food stalls varying from Chinese to American.,PLATINUM SHOPPING CENTER. Pronounced 'pratunam' by locals, this mall is a good place to shop if you\u2019re planning to buy clothes in bulk,Platinum Shopping Mall, (known locally as \"Pratunam\") is a good place to shop when one wants to buy lots of clothes. The shops offer wholesale prices. ,ART OF HAGGLING. The best places for bargain prices are the street shops,If you\u2019re looking for the cheapest prices in Bangkok, there\u2019s no better place to shop than in the street shops. Some of the products in the malls can be found in the street shops in almost half the price. Again, you can haggle.,A shopping tip: ,Have a Thai shopping guide or companion. It\u2019s easier to get lower prices when you\u2019re with a person who knows the language. ,4. Beer,If you\u2019re like me who loves having a good time while exploring a country, then you\u2019ll certainly enjoy Bangkok. There are various clubs and drinking spots around the city.,GOOD TIMES. The beer garden has different mini-concert stages in the 3 major bars owned by beer companies Chang, Leo, and Singha,The most famous one is the ,Beer Garden, at the Bangkok Centre. Here, you\u2019ll find 3 drinking areas run by 3 beer companies \u2013 Chang, Singha, and Leo. Single beer bottle prices are okay, but it is cheaper to order beer towers and buckets. ,Khao San, road is where most tourists party. The entrance fees and beers are more expensive compared to those in the Beer Garden. It\u2019s where you'll experience street parties, though. There are also fast food restaurants in the area where one can sober up.,My co-delegates and I went to ,The Safehouse,, a club. I paid 700 Baht for entrance but it was worth it. This is where we PARTIED (resulting to hangovers the next day).,5. Going about,Bangkok is a wonderful city. It\u2019s not so easy to understand its culture and traditions, but most of the Thais I met were welcoming and fun to be with. The city is a good mix of old and modern.,Someday, I hope to go back and explore the places outside Bangkok. Khob kun Krub! ,- Rappler.com,[Have YOU started planning your summer itinerary?

A cigarette was an unwelcome commodity in my mother\u2019s house, and I have been trying as hard as I can to be smoke-free.,I\u2019m a few months shy of 27, tried my first cigarette at 13, had my first puff at 9. What started from juvenile curiosity became a habit I have been struggling to break for the past decade. I have been smoking for more than half of my life.,Kiss of death,I remember my first puff like it was my first kiss, although it was more akin to a kiss of death. It was during a weekend afternoon at home in Pampanga sometime in 1995.,The air was slightly acrid from the groundswell after a summer rain. During those days, if you sniffed hard enough, you could get a whiff of the sulphuric residue from Mt Pinatubo.,My uncle was slumped against the wall of our tiny garage, defiantly puffing away as my mother admonished him. She rattled off a litany of smoking hazards, railed against his asthmatic tendencies and his being a bad example to her children. And in true Gen-Xer fashion, he simply tuned out.,He flicked the cigarette right into the ashtray next to him and walked away. When he left, I teetered towards the ashtray and saw his cigarette, its embers still smoldering. I grabbed it, perplexed by how something odious enjoyed habitual consumption. I took a puff, nearly choking over the stench that ricocheted through my nostrils. I quickly extinguished the butt on the tray and furtively looked if anybody witnessed my crime.,I attended Sunday Mass later that day, conflicted over what I committed earlier \u2013 smug with self-importance at keeping up with the grown-ups, but plagued by Catholic guilt. I might have kept my sordid secret from my immediate authority figures, but not from an omniscient God.,Rites of passage,I would meet the Marlboro man again 4 summers later.,At 13, I was in my junior year in high school, feeling left out by batchmates brandishing their student driving permits. I spent the summer of \u201999 with my cousins in Bicol, free from parental supervision, but sourly mourning over not learning how to drive alongside my peers.,My cousins were a little older, a good number of them in their late teens. They had drinking and smoking privileges and would take me out with them. That summer was my rite of passage, where I drank more than I thought I could and puffed my first cigarette.,\u201c,Huwag mong higupin \u2019yung usok agad ,(Don\u2019t drag the smoke in right away),\u201d, ,a cousin taught me. \u201c,Nahihilo ka dahil hindi ka pa sanay (,You get dizzy because you\u2019re not used to it).\" Drag slowly, and blow smoothly.,Someday,,, I thought, I\u2019ll be able to blow smoke rings like they do,.,I might have been a misfit in school, but I was part of the cool clique with my older cousins. For the first time since my entry into adolescence, I was welcomed. I belonged.,Charade,I never intended to pick up the habit, but I had a juvenile fear of not fitting in if my blockmates found out how young I was. I spent a fifth of my daily allowance on cigarettes, smoking as many as 20 sticks a day. I hung out with the cool kids. We lent each other lighters and employed a popular tenet for cigarette allocation \u2013 one pack for all, all packs for one.,I met one of my best friends in a smokers\u2019 pocket garden set up in Ateneo during my 3,rd, year. While burning our lungs off, we labored over the school paper, lamented unrequited crushes, cursed our Math professors, and snarked over passers-by.,In hindsight, sustaining my vice was a result of my avid romanticization of the ties I had formed. What started as a means to downplay my youth became a tool for bonding with people I grew to genuinely care for.,I knew it was becoming an addiction when I found myself having difficulty focusing on school work without cigarettes. If I had readings on one hand, I had to have a cigarette on the other to stay focused. However, I didn\u2019t mind the addiction \u2013 I embraced it. Smoking was too convenient, as it served as an instant fix, a panacea for all my adolescent schoolgirl woes.,The exodus,Halfway through my 20s, I felt a genuine, almost desperate desire to kick the habit, but momentary convenience was a lure too strong to break away from. The resolve to quit was overpowered by my petulant intolerance of withdrawal symptoms. I had become susceptible to the much-loathed smokers\u2019 hack.,I immersed myself in sports and improved from being chain smoker to social smoker. Spending time with workout buddies made me hold off the cigarettes, as it would have been disrespectful to be the lone smoker in a group of non-smokers.,I still carry a pack in my bag, but do not finish it in one sitting like I used to. My progress is excruciatingly slow, but sure. From my usual 20 a day, I\u2019m down to two to three, even going zero on some days. With the price of cigarettes increasing, maybe I should buy a Vape, if cold turkey leaves me too vulnerable.,I've had relapses after numerous attempts to go cold turkey, but, ,was pleased when the Sin Tax bill was passed. The markup on the price of cigarettes has given me greater incentive to quit the habit entirely. As short-sighted as it seems, the hazards and costs of the habit do not seem to outweigh the difficulty of the overwhelming struggle against the withdrawal.,The exodus is not yet over for me and millions of other smokers. Even if I quit and puff my last stick for the day, there\u2019s no assurance I won\u2019t relapse tomorrow. But I\u2019m making a real effort to be smoke-free. Now who\u2019s with me? \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/19148-confessions-of-a-struggling-nicotine-dependent", "title": "Confessions of a struggling nicotine dependent", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective"},

So that we can see if it's reasonable for them to have such expenses,\" she said.,The former COA chair also explained that the grant of intelligence and confidential funds lies in the hands of the legislature. ,For instance, while the Office of the President is not an intelligence-gathering office, its request to have billions in confidential and intelligence funds is up to the legislature to approve.,For 2017, the ,Office of the President, has requested P1.25 billion for Confidential Expenses, a 400% increase from the P250 million in 2016. It also requested the same amount for Intelligence Expenses, likewise up from P250 million allocated this year.,Audit guidelines,Because the specific disbursements and use of these funds are not spelled out, and COA relies on what the agencies themselves submit to auditors, Tan said she often asked why COA had to audit these funds.,In an attempt to set standards in reporting and documenting the use of these funds, COA came out with guidelines on the use and audit of confidential and intelligence funds in January 2015.,The ,joint circular, was formulated by COA, together with the Department of Budget and Management, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of National Defense, and the Governance Commission for GOCCs.,The guidelines spelled out stricter accounting and auditing rules to ensure that the funds are used properly. ,\"We worked hard to come up with this circular so that agencies can have some kind of standard in reporting, documenting, and utilizing these funds,\" she said. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/rich-media/146494-confidential-intelligence-funds-audit-process-coa-chair", "title": "Confidential, intel funds difficult to audit \u2013 ex-COA chair", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/trending/%20Al-Qur'an%20daun%20lontar,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/150044-star-magic-ball-2016-kim-chiu-xian-lim-kimxi,http://www.rappler.com/nation/146051-house-appropriations-committee-budget-office-of-the-president-office-of-the-vice-president"},

{"content": "\nManny Pacquiao hasn't been saying 'it's up to my promoter' lately and it's the best thing he could be doing for his boxing career    ,SPEAKING OUT. Manny Pacquiao and his team take a more proactive role in arranging his next fight as interest for a showdown with Jeff Horn stalls. Photo by Ted Aljibe/AFP   ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It wasn't very hard for Manny Pacquiao to contain his excitement about the prospect of fighting Jeff Horn. That's because there wasn't any to contain.,By the point in January when we spoke face-to-face at his office in the Senate, he had been briefed and asked several times about the possibility of fighting the unbeaten but untested Australian, but still referred to ,his unfamiliarity, in the present tense.,\"This is my first time to hear his name,\" said Pacquiao. ,Pacquiao may be accustomed to lengthy speeches on the Senate floor and in his sermons as a pastor, but he's a man of few words when it comes to boxing. When I asked him about the lightly regarded challenge of Chris Algieri, Pacquiao answered there was \"nothing to worry about.\",Or when he was scheduled to face Jessie Vargas, the last man in the Top Rank assembly line of Pacquiao's opponents, he allowed that Vargas' style was tailor-made for his own but wouldn't take him lightly.,Pacquiao usually has a reason to say what he says, and he isn't hiding the lack of interest he has in fighting Horn, a 4-year pro who competed at the 2012 Olympics but has yet to face a name people would recognize in 2017. Horn is a good fighter and may even become a world champion some day. But he's a significant step down in notoriety from Pacquiao's recent opponents.,Pacquiao is a big fight boxer accustomed to headlining pay-per-view events and selling out arenas. He's also 38 years old and a 21-year veteran of the ring. It isn't easy to get motivated to spar dozens of rounds and run those miles early in the morning to prepare for your first opponent in 10 years who hasn't won a world title.,That, and the relatively modest earning potential of a fight no one would buy on pay-per-view outside of Queensland, may explain the delay in announcing Pacquiao's opponent for his April 23 fight date, which he himself announced on Twitter would take place in the United Arab Emirates and not in Australia, where Horn's promoter Dean Lonergan of Duco Events ,figured Pacquiao would face Horn, through conversations with Top Rank boss Bob Arum.,It may also explain his other Twitter chess moves, like issuing a poll in which 48% of the nearly 45,000 respondents preferred Amir Khan to be his next opponent, and just 7% picked Jeff Horn. Kell Brook, the IBF welterweight titleholder, came in second at 24% while Terence Crawford came in at 21%., ,Khan would not only make for an entertaining matchup, but also sound business sense. The English boxer has strong name recognition value, and his last fight, a knockout loss to Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez last May, sold a reported 600,000 pay-per-view buys.,Pacquiao and Khan also know each other well, having spent years training together under Freddie Roach in Los Angeles and in the Philippines. It'd also bring their impromptu photo op in England two years ago full circle. Pacquiao wound up fighting Floyd Mayweather instead, understandably.,Is it interesting that Khan has also been tweeting, asking people who they'd like to see him fight next? I think so.,Earlier on Sunday, February 19, Pacquiao appeared to be following the action between Adrien Broner and Adrian Granados, tweeting generic praise for the action like \"Good fight so far\" and \"Now that's a fight! Who won?\" Pacquiao could be watching Broner's competitive split-decision win and seeing a beatable yet highly recognizable figure among boxing audiences whose divisiveness could make for an interesting promotion.,Mayweather is only interested in going up against UFC fighters, while Juan Manuel Marquez is content to sit on his win in their fourth fight.,Outside of them, both Khan and Broner, more so than the accomplished but unassuming Crawford, have the best chance to reignite Pacquiao's star power after it waned in 2016 with the loss of sponsorships and the general indifference to his fights among fans.,While all of this is playing out on social media, Arum has not chimed in on Pacquiao's announcements, which shows more autonomy than Pacquiao's typical refrain of \"It's up to my promoter.\" Pacquiao's advisor Michael Koncz made assurances in an interview with ,FightNews, that the decision to fight in the Middle East was due to greater financial incentive and that Pacquiao remains on good terms with Top Rank.,\"Manny has made it clear that he will end his career with Top Rank,\" said Koncz, adding \",we all find a way to work things out.\" Koncz did still say that Horn was \"still in the mix\" of potential opponents.,Emails to Horn's manager Glenn Rushton and a Top Rank source seeking clarity on recent matters were not returned.,If Pacquiao does pull a surprise when he announces his next opponent, he'll have an opportunity to remind people just how great he is. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/161942-making-pacquiao-great-again", "title": "Making Pacquiao great again", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/150044-star-magic-ball-2016-kim-chiu-xian-lim-kimxi,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/159283-pacquiao-horn-never-heard-of,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/161229-pacquiao-next-fight-uae-horn-promoter-australia"},

{"content": "\nWithout focusing on making people aware they are part of ASEAN, how can we expect them to work together smoothly?    , ,RAISING AWARENESS. Institutions like Thailand\u2019s Chulalongkorn University spearhead efforts on promoting awareness about the ASEAN to student leaders from around the region.In this photo, Southeast Asian student leaders discuss their views on the ASEAN mindset.,Last November, I attended the 2012 ASEAN Student Forum hosted by Chulalongkorn University in ,Bangkok, Thailand,. The goal of the conference was to create an ASEAN mindset among student leaders in the region in preparation for the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015.,To the surprise of the delegates and organizers, one of the speakers said there is no such thing as an ASEAN mindset. He noted that there are still many issues to be reconciled in the region and that Southeast Asians do not yet have a shared identity.,I, along with many of my co-delegates, agreed with him. Most Southeast Asians\u2019 perspectives are not set in our region but in countries outside it. Frankly speaking, very few Filipinos have a sense of an ASEAN identity. We relate more with Americans than with Indonesians or Vietnamese and this is prevalent in most countries in the region.,During my recent trip to Viet Nam and Cambodia last April, I was also saddened though not surprised by the fact that most of the Vietnamese and Khmer locals preferred entertaining and serving Westerners, Japanese, or Europeans instead of Filipinos, Malaysians, or Indonesians. I experienced this in restaurants, shops, travel agencies and even in the airport.,Now, why is this problematic?,ASEAN Economic Community,The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) recently concluded the, 22,nd, ASEAN Summit, in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam. On top of this meeting are preparations for 2015.,2015 marks the birth of the ,ASEAN Economic Community,. It will mark the start of free trade between the 10 member-countries. Products and services, among other things, will have a single market and production base. Labor, investments and capital will have a freer flow.,Economically speaking, some experts say that the region, more so the Philippines, is not yet ready for ,economic integration,. Aside from the fact that the member-countries are not on the same level in terms of economic growth, some countries also have unstable economies due to their political contexts (i.e. Myanmar).,National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) ,Former Secretary-General Romulo Virola, in 2012 even said that the Philippines is not yet ready to benefit from the economic integration in 2015 given that we still have to focus on the problems of our local economy.,More than economics, however, the issues that were earlier raised, I think, is of equal importance. The many unresolved differences in the region and the lack of ASEAN identity might become stumbling blocks for the envisioned economic integration. I believe that more focus should be given to such issues to have a successful AEC.,Unresolved historical, cultural issues ,Last year, I was able to go around 7 countries in Southeast Asia. I would argue that the region is home to the most diverse and beautiful cultures in the world. From the Wats of Bangkok to the shrines of Bali, the different cultures of the peoples of ASEAN are reflected not only in infrastructure but in every aspect of their lives. Indonesia and the Philippines alone are home to hundreds of cultural groups and ethnicities.,As beautiful as it is, cultural diversity, however, can be a stumbling block for the AEC, given that it also reflects the historically unsolved issues of the countries that eventually erupt into, territorial disputes,.,A good example would be the century-old tension between Thailand and Cambodia over the claims on Preah Vihear temple and surrounding territories. From 2008-2011, Thai and Khmer military forces had been clashing over the ownership of the temple grounds which are found near the border. Both countries had historical claims on the area and would not let go of the territory. The temple is currently part of the Kingdom of Cambodia but Thailand has not given up its claim.,SOURCE OF CONFLICT. Despite the rich history of the region, a lot of conflicts remain unsolved. This Angkor Wat in Cambodia became the cause of the Phnom Penh riots when a Thai actress made a false claim that the temple belonged to Thailand. All photos by David Lozada.,Looking at more recent events, of course, there\u2019s the conflict involving the ,Sultanate of Sulu,\u2019s ancestral claims to parts of Sabah. The incident eventually led to a bloody stand-off between the Malaysian and Sulu forces and has put bilateral relations between Malaysia and the Philippines in jeopardy.,I think the reason for such disputes in the region is that we have not yet solved issues involving our historical differences. We have kept the issues in our history books hoping that they will not be tackled. The truth, however, is that such issues still affect how ASEAN peoples interact with each other.,Openness to other cultures, ironically, is not so widespread in most parts of Southeast Asia. This problem even starts at the local levels. In Malaysia, for example, there\u2019s the hidden tension between Malays, Chinese-Malaysians and Hindus.,Some of my friends in Malaysia emphasize they should be seen as Chinese-Malaysians and that they rarely speak Bahasa. On the other hand, my Malay friends often see themselves as the majority and the original inhabitants of the land.,We do not even have to look far. In the Philippines, the peace process between the government and the Muslim groups in Mindanao is still a struggle. Even with the Bangsamoro entity, there is still tension with other Muslim groups in the island.,Awareness and identity,When I was in Viet Nam, I was approached by 3 college students who wanted to converse with me to practice their English. I agreed and our conversation started. I observed that many other students in the park were doing the same thing but only with Caucasian foreigners. I asked why this is so and one of them pointed out that most students do not want to converse with ASEAN foreigners since they think they are uneducated.,This experience shocked me. I think that a prerequisite to having a community is to first have the awareness that we have one. Based on my experiences and that of my friends in Southeast Asia, I think that ASEAN remains only a regional grouping. I will not even call us a community yet.,The speaker in the forum I attended was right. We do not have an ASEAN mindset to begin with. People from Southeast Asia relate more with Europeans, Americans, Koreans and Japanese rather than with people from their own region. We do not think ASEAN. We think outside of it.,Aside from being a Filipino, the next bigger picture is being Asian, not even Southeast Asian.,So are we ready?,If we talk about economics, some would argue that, perhaps we are. If we talk about culture, awareness and identity, I would say no. How can we, after all, be ready for something that very few people know of?,Creating an economic community with citizens who are almost indifferent to each other would be problematic. If there\u2019s no sense of identifying with people from our region, how can we have interconnected trading networks and businesses? Without focusing on making people aware they are part of ASEAN, how can we expect them to work together smoothly?,One of the strongest criticisms of ASEAN is that it is exclusive to leaders, and that awareness does not trickle down to ordinary citizens. This is, perhaps, partially true. There is a need for greater awareness and knowledge in the region about the region. I think this is a prerequisite to a successful ASEAN Economic Community.,Southeast Asia has great potential and so does economic integration in 2015. It must, however, follow the right preparatory steps. Perhaps, there should be equal focus on strengthening the economic and the community aspects of the AEC. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/27543-asean-economic-community-readiness-2015", "title": "ASEAN Economic Community: Are we ready for 2015?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/150044-star-magic-ball-2016-kim-chiu-xian-lim-kimxi,http://www.rappler.com/nation/152941-marcos-body-batac-mausoleum-hero-burial,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/19942-travelthursday-wats-shopping-beer-in-bangkok,http://www.rappler.com/world/27357-asean-summit-brunei-china-trade"},

But Poe's supporters within the ruling coalition have balked at the idea, citing her survey numbers.,Meetings,Aquino has held separate meetings with the two.,Last week, Aquino hosted a ,dinner meeting, with both camps. But the meeting did not yield anything concrete. ,Roxas is lagging behind Poe and Vice President Jejomar Binay in presidential preference surveys.

In comparison, Roxas rated 6%, just a notch ahead of Senator Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr who got 5%.,A distant second to Binay was Senator Grace Poe with 15%, followed by Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago with 10%, and Senator Chiz Escudero with 9%. Roxas ranked No. 5 with his 6% rating, followed by Marcos. ,Poe topped the senatorial race, in 2013, an unexpected feat at the time.,Roxas has been plagued by criticism for his handling of the recent disasters that have hit the country \u2013 among them, the ,Zamboanga siege, of September 2013 and the devastating ,Super Typhoon Yolanda, that hit parts of the Visayas in November 2013.,Ranking No. 7 in the list of preferred presidential candidates were Senator Alan Peter Cayetano and celebrity and presidential sister Kris Aquino with 4% each. Senator Ramon \u201cBong\u201d Revilla Jr, who faces a ,plunder charge before the Office of the Ombudsman,, obtained a 3% rating and ranked No. 8, followed by Rehabilitation Czar Panfilo \u201cPing\u201d Lacson with 2%.,Cayetano, also Senate Majority Leader, is said to harbor ,presidential ambitions,.

For respondents in the National Capital Region, the Balance of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, Pulse Asia reported an error margin of \u00b16%.,Across the regions, Binay consistently rated high. He was highest in the balance of Luzon with 44%, followed by the National Capital Region (NCR) with 38%, Mindanao with 37%, and the Visayas with 35%.,Across economic classes, he was also the preferred presidential candidate, getting the approval of 47% of classes ABC, 42% of class D, and 34% of class E. The majority of Filipino voters come from classes D and E.,Vice presidential choices,Nationwide, Poe emerged as the preferred choice for vice president, obtaining an approval rating of 24%, followed by Escudero with 20%.

Among the possible 12 who emerged were the following, with their respective ranks:,Sotto previously figured in a ,plagiarism controversy, in the Senate but has appeared to survive it. Similarly, Drilon has been linked to Janet Lim Napoles, the woman who allegedly engineered the pork barrel scam. Drilon had appeared in pictures with her in social events, but does not seem to have been adversely affected, if survey results are any indication. (READ: ,Drilon regains approval after pork probe debacle,),New names in the possible senatorial list include boxing champ and ,Sarangani Representative Pacquiao,, Hontiveros who ran but lost in 2013, and De Lima who has been high profile as justice secretary owing to the pork barrel controversy.,Senator TG Guingona,, also in the media as a result of his chairmanship of the blue ribbon committee which investigated the pork barrel scandal, is outside the Magic 12.

{"content": "\nWhen cops who are called as witnesses in cases don't appear at hearings, courts dismiss thousands of cases, most of them drug-related    ,UPGRADE. Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno and Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas witness the signing of a memorandum of agreement for the new e-subpoena system. Photo by Bea Cupin/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The justice system of the social media capital of world finally gets an upgrade it badly needs.,The Justice Sector Coordinating Council \u2013 composed of the top brass of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Supreme Court \u2013 launched on Wednesday, April 30, the ,Electronic Subpoena Service and Management Project of the \"e-Subpoena System.\",With one click, court administrators can now serve subpoenas to police officers named as witnesses in criminal cases. The new system is being tested in Quezon City before it is eventually rolled out to the rest of the National Capital Region.,Here's how it works: court administrators enter details of the subpoena in the PNP's data base using the e-subpoena form. Once it's sent, the PNP unit's court process officer (CPO) acknowledges receipt and is in charge of informing the police officer being summoned.,Within 3 days of receiving the subpoena, the CPO and the station's police chief, through the PNP's Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM), will then inform the court of the availability or non-availability of the police officer being summoned.,Police chiefs ultimately are responsible for making sure police officers show up in court. Non-appearance without a valid reason can lead to the filing of an administrative or criminal case against a police officer.    ,Police no-shows,Speaking at the launch of the e-subpoena at Camp Crame, Chief Justice Lourdes Serreno said suspects were being detained for longer than necessary. Hearings were being postponed repeatedly due to the absence of policemen who were summoned to testify.,\",Sinasabi nila na hindi naman po nila kayang hindi i-postpone ang hearing kung ang mga testigo ay wala.... Tinanong ko: sa mga testigo pong iyon, sino po karamihan nagkakaroon ng problema sa pagsipot sa hearing? Sinasabi nila sa akin, mga pulis daw po, lalong lalo na sa mga drug cases,,\" said Sereno.,(The judges said they didn't have a choice but to postpone the hearings because there were no witnesses. I asked them: among those witnesses, who usually fail to show up? They said the policemen, especially when it comes to drug cases.),According to the DIDM, PNP units all over the country received over 100,000 subpoenas in 2013. Of those, 7,000 were not complied \u2013 meaning police officers failed to show up during the hearing for one reason or another. As a result of non-compliance, over 1,000 cases were dismissed in 2013.,TEST RUN. The e-subpoena system is still being tested in Quezon City, but will soon be rolled out to NCR and key cities in the Philippines. Photo by Rappler,The PNP said, in some cases, police officers were being bought out or threatened by principals of the suspects. But in some cases, Sereno said, police officers did not show up because they didn't receive the court's summon at all.,\"',Pag nagpadala sila ng subpoena na ayon sa traditional na pamamaaraan, higit dalawang buwan bago makarating,,\" said Sereno. (If they send the subpoenas the traditional way, it takes almost two months for it to reach the police.),With the e-subpoena, courts are required to serve the subpoenas at least 5 days before the scheduled hearing or within one day from the \"order of the court for the service of subpoena duces tecum or subpoena ad testificandum.\",\",Halimbawa po na ang judge ay masipag, may mga bagay po na wala sa kanyang control ngunit nagko-cause ng delay. Bawat delay ay isang malaking kawalan sa sistema ng hustisya,,\" added Sereno. ,(Even if the judge is hardworking, there are causes of delays that are beyond his control. Each delay is a huge loss to our justice system.),From ',just tiis,' to justice,The e-subpoena is the brainchild of the Justice Sector Coordinating Council's July 2013 meeting attended by Sereno, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, and Interior and Local Government Secretary Manuel Roxas II.,Sereno called it a \"major breakthrough\" in the Philippine justice system.,During the launch, Roxas said the new subpoena system marked the change from \",just tiis, to justice.\",\",Masakit para sa amin sa DILG at PNP na madinig na ang isang kaso ay pinirdir by virtue of non-compliance,,\" said Roxas. (It pains us at the DILG and the PNP to hear when a case is dismissed or lost by virtue of non-compliance.) ,Roxas, who is also chairman of the National Police Commission, said an upgrade in the system of serving subpoenas will also allow police to serve better. In Quezon City alone, police stations receive over 900 subpoenas daily. ,\",Malaking tulong din ito sa PNP na kung saan mapaplano at malalaman sino bang nasa korte, sino'ng libre nang sa ganon patuloy pa rin ang presensya sa mga kalye at sa field at hindi lang na ang buong PNP ay nag-aantay sa court rooms para sa kanilang appearance,,\" he added. ,(It's a huge help to the PNP because they can plan ahead \u2013 who will appear before the courts, who's free, so they don't lose their presence in the streets and the field, and we don't find the entire PNP spending their time waiting at court rooms for their appearance.),Connectivity issues,But the transition from snail mail to email won't be that easy. For the e-subpoena to work, police stations should have a computer units and reliable Internet connection, aside from user accounts in the database.,\",Internet-capable naman at hindi naman malaking file ito, so kahit mabagal ang Internet connection sa kanila, kahit nga cellphone lang ang gagamiting signal kakayanin ito dahil papel lang ito.... Maliit na file ito kaya kahit ang bandwidth ay hindi masyadong robust, lulusot pa rin ito,,\" said Roxas.,(The files aren't that big, so even if their Internet connection is slow, even if it is only equivalent to cellphone signals, the system can handle it. The files are small so even if the bandwidth isn't robust, it will still work.),According to PNP PIO head Chief Superintendent Theodore Sindac, around 10% of the country's police stations still have connectivity issues. For police stations in far-flung areas, Sindac said the e-subpoenas would be the responsibility of regional offices.,Sindac said testing in Quezon City would run for around a month to iron out kinks. The new system will then be rolled out in the National Capital Region and, eventually, in key cities in the Philippines before the year ends. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/56827-police-courts-upgrade-electronic-subpoena", "title": "Courts to use e-subpoena to make sure cops attend hearings", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/162642-new-nokia-3310-photos-specs-design,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161647-campaign-donor-samuel-uy-money-honeylet-duterte-children,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/133877-two-pronged-ofw-husband-wife,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/nation/51113-sc-cj-sereno-online-subpoenas"},

Manny Pacquiao shot down Bob Arum's plan of fighting 4 times in 2017, saying \"I'm not a robot.\" Photo by Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP ,MANILA, Philippines - It\u2019s hard for Manny Pacquiao to formulate an opinion on Jeff Horn, the unbeaten Australian who has been named as his likely next opponent. That\u2019s because he had never heard of the fighter before he was presented as a potential challenger for his WBO welterweight title.,\u201cThis is my first time to hear his name,\u201d said Pacquiao on Monday, January 23, during an interview at his temporary office in the Philippine Senate.,That\u2019s because Horn (16-0-1, 11 knockouts) isn\u2019t yet a big name outside of his home country, despite making the quarterfinals of the 2012 Olympics. Pacquiao\u2019s promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank got his first look at him in December, when he knocked out veteran Ali Funeka in 6 rounds on the undercard of the WBO heavyweight title fight between Joe Parker and Andy Ruiz Jr in New Zealand., ,Pacquiao, 38, says the fight has not yet been finalized, revealing that promoters are still working out the venue for the fight, which is expected to take place April 23., ,\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the finalization within two weeks from now,\u201d said Pacquiao, who last defeated Jessie Vargas in November., ,\u201cOnce we get a venue, we\u2019ll confirm an opponent.

The venue\u2019s the priority right now,\" Koncz said.,Even though Horn would be Pacquiao\u2019s first opponent in 10 years who wasn\u2019t a current or former world champion, Koncz says there is still need for caution in approaching any fighter., ,\u201cEvery opponent is a dangerous opponent at this time in Manny\u2019s career because you don\u2019t know when he\u2019s gonna get old. If you put it on paper and compare it to Manny\u2019s schedule, it doesn\u2019t match. But again, you can\u2019t just go by what\u2019s on the paper,\u201d said Koncz, who likewise had not previously heard of Horn, the WBO's number-two-ranked welterweight.,(READ: ,Jeff Horn: I can beat Manny Pacquiao,),Pacquiao also shot down ,Arum\u2019s plan to have him fight 4 times in 2017,, with a fight to follow in July, in September, and another at the end of the year as a farewell bout against Terence Crawford, the unbeaten unified junior welterweight champion., ,\u201cI\u2019m not a robot.

Pacquiao isn\u2019t expected to be in the boxing gym until 6 or 7 weeks before the fight, and his camp says they aren\u2019t yet concerned about who their opponent will be for the end of the year bout., ,\u201cAt this stage in Manny\u2019s career, we don\u2019t have a whole big list to pick from.

{"content": "\nIn 2001, helpless Zamboange\u00f1os watched rebels point their guns at children and other hostages. About 12 years later, \u2018Never again\u2019 is the city\u2019s battlecry.    ,COMMAND CONFERENCE: President Aquino meeting with Secretaries Mar Roxas, Voltaire Gazmin, PNP Chief Alan Purisima, AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Emmanuel Bautista, Western Mindanao Command Commander Gen. Rey Ardo and members of the AFP at the height of the crisis in Zamboanga City. Malaca\u00f1ang Photo,ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines \u2014 \u201cWhat drama is this, Mr President?\u201d,It was the night of Day 5, September 13, and the meeting between President Benigno Aquino III and Zamboanga City local officials and stakeholders was highly charged. Zamboange\u00f1os were frustrated that the standoff was taking too long.,\u201cWho is really in control?\u201d asked another. ,President Aquino tried to calm them. He stressed that the situation is under control. It\u2019s only 5 out of 98 barangays under siege. They\u2019re not \u201cisolated\u201d just because air travels were cancelled. Land travels were still allowed.,The President\u2019s statement echoed earlier statements by Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas II that only \u201ca very, very small portion of Zamboanga\u201d is affected by conflict. ,One frustrated councilor felt the ground commanders downplayed the situation to the President, who arrived in the city that day.,Officials from Manila observing the meeting felt the Zamboange\u00f1os were very disrespectful of the President. ,The very tense meeting on Day 5 gives a glimpse of how the crisis was managed and the challenges they faced. There was no clear leader before the President arrived. The Zamboange\u00f1os were also very suspicious of the national government. ,Zamboange\u00f1os wanted swift military action,CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY: The Zamboanga City Council is asking for a Senate inquiry on the crisis. Photo courtesy of the Zamboanga City government ,Councilor Rogelio Velasco Jr could not understand how it could happen to Zamboanga City.,\"The very ironic question is: How come these things happen in Zamboanga? We have the Western Mindanao Command (Wesmincom). We have the regional police command. We have the naval and the air base. These are the questions the people of Zamboanga are asking our authorities,\" he told Rappler on Day 6 of the crisis.,Even the US military has a facility inside the Wesmincom.,READ: Intel failure? MNLF troops entered Zambo 3 days ago,Police investigation now shows that the MNLF started ,sneaking firearms, into Zamboanga City as early as January.,Ironically, Mayor ,Maria Isabelle \"Beng\" Climaco-,Salazar is married to the chief of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA), retired Major Gen Trifonio Salazar. But the agency has been dismissed as a mere coordinator of intelligence efforts, largely dependent on field work by the police and the military.,Not a few Zamboange\u00f1os wanted swift military action to end the crisis. \u201cThat\u2019s the only option, maybe. It is also the clamor of the people of Zamboanga,\u201d said Zamboanga City Rep Lilia Nu\u00f1o a day after the meeting.,\u201cIf it will still drag on, the scenario will be worse. There might be looting because people are already hungry. This is the thing that we are preventing,\u201d Nu\u00f1o told Rappler then.,When a full-blown military assault was discussed during the Friday night meeting, the President asked, \u201cDo you understand what you are talking about? Can you attend the funeral of 300?\u201d,MILITARY ZONE. Soldiers in Zamboanga City. Photo by EPA,The military started advancing against the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters a few hours before the Friday night meeting \u2014 shifting its approach from \u201ccontainment\u201d to \u201ccalibrated response.\u201d The following day, Saturday morning, was when the military used for the first time heavy-powered firearms.,\u201cThe way I see it, it\u2019s already an assault,\u201d Nu\u00f1o told Rappler. Two days later, on Day 8 of the crisis, Alert Level 4 was raised, meaning the situation demanded the President\u2019s attention.,Salazar also announced she wanted it over that day, September 14, Day 6 of the crisis.,It's a unique war \u2014 an urban warfare \u2014 with a very different terrain. It's a densely populated residential neighborhood. Aside from taking the residents as hostages, the MNLF used the houses as hiding places.,The standoff dragged until the 20th day because, according to the military, the President\u2019s instruction was to make sure all the hostages were safe.,Even as the military eventually launched air strikes, the President's instructions meant they couldn\u2019t use the full arsenal of the military to quash the MNLF. ,In the end, 195 hostages were rescued. Two were killed and 7 were wounded. ,\"By any standards, I think that is a good accomplishment on the part of the military,\" said Armed Forces chief Gen Emmanuel Bautista.,Looking back, Salazar said it was \"God's perfect timing\" that a full-blown military assault did not happen. ,Mayor\u2019s non-negotiable,Salazar, pursued negotiations with the MNLF. She even spoke with MNLF founder Nur Misuari and Commander Habier Malik on the phone.,\u201cYes. Negotiations took place. Negotiations were exhausted to the best we can. At the end of the day, what they sought was the return and full implementation of the final peace accord. It is not within my level as city mayor,\u201d ,Salazar ,told Rappler in an interview.,There was an opportunity to peacefully end the crisis during the early stages of the standoff. Malik offered to release all hostages on condition they would be given a \u201csafe conduct pass\u201d so they could return to the negotiating table.,Malik wanted to repeat what happened 12 years ago when the MNLF pulled the same stunt in Zamboanga City\u2019s barangay\u2019s Cabatangan. The city allowed the MNLF a \u201csafe conduct pass\u201d and they were forced to literally watch the rebels walk away \u2014 on live TV \u2014 in exchange for the safety of the hostages.,READ: Bungled chances in Zamboanga City,The 2001 standoff ended overnight. But it split the city residents then because critics felt allowing the MNLF members to walk away will only encourage them to do it again.,On September 9, the rebels were back. Zamboange\u00f1os expected the two-month mayor to make sure the rebels wouldn't repeat Cabatangan.,Salazar often cried in press briefings in the early days of the crisis. But as easily as tears welled up in her eyes, she would quickly straighten up to show her firm resolve that Malik and his men should be punished.,Salazar made this clear to the generals. This was her non-negotiable and she would repeat her message over and over. ,ARRESTED: Military arrests 2 MNLF fighters on Day 8 of crisis. Photo by LeAnne Jazul,Negotiation,Among those who offered to help in the negotiation as early as Day 1 is the Sulu-based Bantay Bayanihan, the military's own multi-sectoral program to combat insurgency and rebellion.,Grace Jimeno Rebollos, the regional Bantay Bayanihan convener for western Mindanao, lamented the hardline position of Salazar against a Cabatangan solution.,\u201cNot wanting a Cabatangan was a constant mantra. Yet the lives of civilian hostages figured much in the dilemma,\u201d said Rebollos. It would have diminished destruction to life and property, and limited the number of internally displaced persons, she said.,READ: Habier Malik: Trapped in the city he seized,Hostaged Catholic priest Fr Michael Ufana also pushed for the Cabatangan solution. It\u2019s the only way to make sure the hostages are safe, he said. ,What government can do to seek justice is hunt down Malik and his men when they have left Zamboanga City, the priest argued.,But Salazar stuck to her guns. ,\u201cPeople who are not from Zamboanga can only empathize to a certain degree,\" she said. ,The issue is also deeper than Cabatangan. ,Zamboange\u00f1os see both 2001 Cabatangan siege and the September 9 attack against the backdrop of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement signed by the Marcos government with the MNLF, which aims to include Zamboanga City among 13 provinces to form the autonomous region. The city repeatedly voted against it in plebiscites.,MNLF hoisting their flag at the City Hall was simply unacceptable.,Rebollos also slammed the \u201crefusal\u201d of their military partners to entertain their efforts during the crisis.,\u201cAmidst the burning of houses, our interlocutors were in no mood to meet us, and even exhorted us to 'forget Bantay Bayanihan,'\u201d Rebollos said.,\u201cWhen push comes to shove, the military will exercise what it does best \u2014 fire the gun ostensibly under the orders of the commander-in-chief,\u201d she added.,Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen Emmanuel Bautista said the ,military option was the final option. ,\u201cThe military was not the one leading the crisis management committee. Unlike in the past, the military commander was at the forefront. Civil authorities were at the forefront. We were just part of the crisis management committee,\" Bautista said.,OPAPP\u2019s mistake,Salazar, for her part, highlighted the role that should have been played by the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP).,It's the biggest lesson of the crisis, she said. \"We have to listen to the diverse voices in Mindanao to dialogue and empathize because it will mean so much in the greater development of her and his story of the children of Mindanao. It pays to listen. If we did not listen, we pay big and pay big time,\" she added.,The OPAPP has been criticized for its failure to properly communicate with the MNLF that it will not be sidetracked by the ongoing peace negotiations with its rival group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). ,\"Ang MNLF iba. Ang MILF iba. Yun ang problema. Kahit ikaw maghinanakit ka rin. Nandoon ang international agreement. Ipapa-apakan mo sa local agreement. Bakit hindi tapusin muna ang international agreement?\", Malik told Rappler in a phone interview on September 15.,(The MNLF is different. The MILF is different. That\u2019s the problem. Even you would resent this. There\u2019s an existing international agreement which you will allow the local agreement to supersede? Why not finish the international agreement first?),But the government said the MNLF is, in fact, invited to join the talks for the creation of the Bangsamoro being discussed at present with the MILF. MNLF personalities may even run to lead the new Bangsamoro entity.,Malik\u2019s former hostage, former Marine Gen Benjamin Dolorfino, also talked about the OPAPP\u2019s shortcomings in communicating this. ,He talked about a conversation with OPAPP officials when he warned about a \u201cpossible violent repercussion\u201d if it is not explained well.,\u201cHe (OPAPP official) told me the government considers the MNLF a spent force. See what happened?\u201d Dolorfino said.,Dolorfino said the reason that led Malik to hostage him in 2007 is the same reason that led him to attack Zamboanga City \u2014 the failure of the Tripartite Review to take off.,\"The MNLF has so much expectation out of the Tripartite Review.  By denying them this venue, they have no other recourse but look for other means to ventilate their position,\" Dolorfino said.,OPAPP Undersecretary Jose Lorena doesn't believe the siege was totally triggered by the talks with MILF.,\"I hate to say this but perhaps Chairman Misuari is already an old man and perhaps he would like to end something with him there in the picture, which is definitely wrong because causing all these is wrong,\" Lorena said. ,\"He was just perhaps jealous of something. He always said, 'I am the founding chairman of the MNLF. These people are just my junior including the new leadership of the MILF.' It's the thought that he cannot readily accept. The process of the MILF and the MNLF are just what we call complementation,\" Lorena added.,Staged war?,As the standoff dragged, Zamboange\u00f1os entertained ideas of a staged war.,Salazar explained: \"This encroachment of fear \u2014 misinformation of text messages and of sightings \u2014 are what causes these rumblings in the heart. It makes the pain, anger and frustration that we would have wanted to go back to normalcy.\",There was talk about the 2016 presidential elections, especially because the crisis involved presumed presidential candidates DILG Secretary Roxas and at one point Vice President Jejomar Binay.,Speculations abounded when Zamboanga City police chief Senior Supt Chiquito Malayo was taken hostage by the MNLF but was able to turn around the situation and instead make 23 MNLF fighters surrender.,READ: Hostaged? Zambo cop doesn't look like it,At least one local radio station commentator lengthily talked about a supposed \"game of the generals.\" It was not uncommon to hear residents \u2014 rich and poor \u2014 echo the speculations.,WAITING. Evacuees wait for food supplies inside a football stadium turned into a temporary shelter. Photo by Dennis Sabangan/EPA,Social media didn\u2019t help. The picture of a Muslim youth leader circulated in the social media and he was accused of organizing young people to reinforce Malik and his men. He eventually faced the media to correct the misconception.,What is being whispered about in Zamboaga City eventually reached Manila. Sen Miriam Santiago accused her political enemy Sen Juan Ponce Enrile, currently embroiled in the alleged pork barrel scam, of, financing the MNLF attack,. It\u2019s supposed to divert national attention from the pork scam to the Zamboanga crisis.,Even former soldiers, Magdalo representatives ,Ashley Acedillo and Gary Alejano,, joined the loose talk.,Answers needed,On September 28, the crisis was declared over although there were still sporadic firefights between government forces and \"remnant\" MNLF fighters hiding in houses. ,READ: Zamboanga crisis over \u2014 Roxas,Military statistics show among those killed were 183 MNLF fighters, 18 soldiers, 5 cops, and 12 civilians. A total of 195 hostages were rescued and 292 MNLF fighters either surrendered or were captured.,Over 10,000 houses were damaged by fires and over 100,000 Zamboange\u00f1os are staying in evacuation centers and will stay there for months until the city government has rehabilitated the combat zone.,BURNED: More than 10,000 houses were damaged by fires inside the combat zone. Photo by LeAnne Jazul,Aquino is confident the MNLF has been diminished and could not launch another attack against Zamboanga City. Cases have been filed against the MNLF fighters in custody and MNLF's Misuari.,Malik could not be found, however. Government troops are determining if he is among the dead bodies recovered. It's not an easy process, supposedly, because some cadavers are in advance stages of decay. Either that, or he has escaped.,But there are questions still waiting to be answered.

They have also proven their capability to head their respective departments.,Secretaries Taguiwalo, Mariano, and Lopez are facing the Commission of Appointments (CA) again after they were previously ,bypassed by the powerful body ,and reappointed by Duterte twice. Despite this, the 3 have continued pursuing policies and programs that have marked a good start for much-needed reforms in the government.,The Department of Social Welfare and Development under ,Secretary Taguiwalo ,has become more efficient in service delivery, guaranteeing that resources reach constituents fully and without delay. We can clearly see this in the present DWSD\u2019s disaster response and relief efforts which have been more effective in reaching survivors in disaster-stricken communities compared to the past.,Secretary Judy has also been vocal in refusing to use so-called \u201cdisaster pork\u201d for patronage politics where relief is distributed by local politicians to foster the people\u2019s support for them in the next elections.,Agrarian Reform Secretary Mariano,, on the other hand, has issued important resolutions such as the moratorium on land use conversion, previously used by landlords to reverse their land\u2019s eligibility for land reform. He has also pushed for land reform and free land distribution as allowed under the limitations of current laws. Mariano has also pushed the same as part of the peace negotiations between the government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). The talks have recently reached a breakthrough agreement, in principle, on free land distribution.,Environment Secretary Lopez, has also implemented unprecedented policies as head of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). The DENR order for the closure of 23 big mining companies and suspension of 5 large-scale mining operations, along with the cancellation of 75 mineral production sharing agreements, is a positive step toward addressing the issues brought about by the current liberalized mining industry which has led to environmental destruction and displacement of communities. DENR's policy to rehabilitate fish pens in Laguna Lake is also a welcome development because this will help clear monopoly interests in the area.,  ,In addition to their individual contributions, it is also necessary to note that the presence of progressive personalities in the Cabinet, particularly Taguiwalo and Mariano, is instrumental in the ongoing peace talks. They have been key figures who have championed the continuation of the peace talks after peace spoilers influenced Duterte to suspend the negotiations in March. Lopez also recently expressed support for the peace talks, acknowledging that \u201cthe way to peace is to address the social injustice on the ground.\u201d,In keeping with the spirit of the negotiations on social and economic reforms, the progressive Cabinet members are already implementing immediate reforms that are within their capacity. Mariano\u2019s distribution of land to peasants and Lopez's opposition to big mines, among others, are in tune with the pillars of agrarian reform and national industrialization envisioned by the Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms outline.,The staunch opposition to the 3 progressive Cabinet members have only shown that the interests of big businesses and landlords in the government are prevailing over the interests of the Filipino masses. We need to push for the confirmation of Taguiwalo, Mariano, and Sec. Gina who truly champion the people\u2019s concerns. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,JM Ayuste is the acting deputy secretary general of Agham, an organization of patriotic and pro-people scientists and advocates.

A housing project of the National Housing Authority in Caloocan City. Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Mother Gemma Atacador and her family used to live in an improvised home made of scraps until they moved to a resettlement site that the government developed in their area in Caloocan.,The settlement, Camarin Residences 3, is one of the housing projects of the National Housing Authority (NHA). The residential compound has 10 buildings with 120 units each.,Compared to their old shanty, Gemma's 24-square-meter unit in the condo-type building is a vast improvement. The compound offers spaces where families can walk and play.,It would have been perfect, she said, if only they could afford the monthly dues that come with their new home.,Depending on the floor level each unit is located, occupants must pay P600 to P1,200 monthly to eventually own the space. Gemma's family on the second floor must pay P900 a month \u2013 an obligation they often fail to meet.,MONTHLY AMORTIZATION: FIRST 5 YEARS,Gemma's dilemma ,P900 is a huge amount for Gemma who relies only on her husband, a taxi driver, for their daily needs. ,\"Ito hindi naman namin kaya eh. Pinatira kami dito pero akala namin [g]aganda ang buhay namin. Hindi rin pala. Marami ring bayarin,\", said the 49-year-old mother.,(We can't afford this. We settled here with the idea that our lives will be better. But, no, there are a lot of dues to pay.),She said they are lucky to have a total income of P8,000 a month because sometimes, when odds are not completely in their favor, her husband brings home only P120 after a day's hard work.,\"Taxi driver siya. Pagka wala siya sa taxi, tricycle. Hindi siya pirmihan. Boundary lang siya\u2026 Sa isang linggo, tatlo o apat lang ang biyahe niya,\", she said of her husband, the sole breadwinner in their family.,(He's a taxi driver. If he's not driving a taxi, he's driving a tricycle. But that's not permanent. He only works on a boundary scheme. In one week, he's only able to drive for 3 to 4 times.),  \n,\"Dalawang beses ako binigyan niyan ng P150-P200. Iiyak nga ako, paano ko iba-budget iyon?\", she asked.,(Twice, he gave me P150 to P200. I was about to cry, how could I budget that?),What they earn is barely enough for their subsistence. And they have two priorities: the tuition of their daughter (P10,000 for one year, already government-subsidized), who is enrolled in a private school, and medicines for their asthmatic toddler.,Paying for the house naturally takes a backseat. And in the meantime, interest for non-payment piles up.,GEMMA'S HOUSEHOLD BUDGET, TOTAL: P8,100,Graduated amortization,Gemma shares this problem with thousands of families in NHA resettlements. Families in both in-city and off-city sites are unable to pay their monthly amortization, which is set to increase as time goes by.,Others end up opening their units for lease or eventually selling them. They just go back to areas in Metro Manila nearer business centers, where there are better chances of finding jobs.,The NHA has put in place a graduated amortization scheme to allow occupants to pay for their subsidized housing.,Due to the lack of land, in-city relocations are usually low-rise buildings that have a subsidized cost of P400,000 to P500,000 per unit. Awardees are given 30 years to pay for it, based on this schedule: , ,NHA Resettlement and Development chief Elsie Trinidad said the difference in the price is due to the higher cost of constructing buildings compared to houses. Meanwhile, in off-city relocation sites such as in Bulacan, a province near Metro Manila, row houses are built because there are bigger lands available. This costs as much as P429,000 per unit.,The graduated amortization for row houses is paid based on this scheme:, ,Free public housing,While these amounts appear reasonable to a middle-income earner, they are a burden to poor families who have no regular source of income. Government, these families say, must offer free public housing to the poorest of the poor.,It is these issues that triggered an ongoing protest in Bulacan.,Around 4,000 urban poor residents have taken over vacant housing units in resettlement sites in ,Pandi, Bulacan, since March 8. The units have been unoccupied for 5 years.,The NHA and even President Rodrigo Duterte have threatened to evict the protesters from the houses they occupied.,Urban poor group Kadamay, which organized the movement, has continued to resist as it reiterated its call for free mass housing.,OCCUPY BULACAN. Urban poor residents occupy idle units in a resettlement site in Bulacan. Photo by Kadamay   ,But can government completely provide free housing?,Trinidad said government also needs to recover expenses from its housing projects to fund future developments.,\"NHA is a corporation, we get subsidies for resettlement [from the national government],\" explained Trinidad. \"There is a continuing subsidy [for housing projects] but as much as possible collection should be regular.\",She said the failure of families to pay their amortization affects the fulfillment of government targets.,The NHA is currently struggling with a 5.5 million housing backlog. It aims to eliminate half of it by providing 500,000 socialized housing units. (READ: ,Robredo: Gov't must build over 2,600 homes a day to beat backlog,) ,Budget-wise, housing has not been a top concern of government.,Vice President Leni Robredo, who used to chair the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC), has said that the housing budget ,rarely crossed the 1% mark,.,If budget has always been a problem for the NHA, how can it even promise free mass housing?,The budget of the NHA for this year is only P12.68 billion \u2013 P17.8 billion less than its budget last year, or a measly 0.38% of the 2017 national budget. ,Key is livelihood,Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor Chairperson Terry Ridon has proposed that government allocate a P236.5-billion housing fund for the construction of in-city relocation for the \"extremely poor\". ,But so far, the Duterte administration has not committed to providing free housing, except for victims of strong typhoons such as Yolanda and Pablo. Those who would be granted homes will still have to pay for the subsidized amount. ,Livelihood near the housing projects would then be the key for the poor to be able to pay for these subsidized houses.  ,  \n,But while the NHA has sponsored programs such as technical-vocational training, schemes for saving up and assistance to job hunting, livelihood facilities in relocation sites have been wanting.,\"We used to do that in the 70s, 80s, but through the years, it has not been given focus,\" admitted Trinidad.  ,The direction the government is taking now is to prioritize in-city relocation so that the poor would not be uprooted from work opportunities. The NHA is also setting up \"new townships\" that are complete with public utilities and within commercial and industrial areas.,Indeed, the poor's failure to pay for housing is tied to other problems, such as lack of livelihood or employment opportunities, below standard minimum wage, and poor infrastructure.,Until these are addressed, families like Gemma's can only pin their hopes on either free public housing or opportunities where they can earn extra cash so they could keep their homes. ,\u2013 Rappler.com  ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/164509-free-public-housing-problems", "title": "Why P600-a-month housing is still a burden to the poor", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/business/16041-what-are-the-top-products-filipinos-buy,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/162098-ronda-rousey-boyfriend-knocked-out,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/133877-two-pronged-ofw-husband-wife,http://www.rappler.com/nation/144665-bocaue-bulacan-housing-military-police-unoccupied-hudcc-robredo,http://www.rappler.com/nation/143271-vice-president-leni-robredo-hudcc-housing-roadmap-backlog"},

There was a time, they say, when all they needed was a Volkswagen Beetle because they could fit all members inside the small car.,Things have changed dramatically for the party since the victory of Benigno \u201cNoynoy\u201d Aquino III in the 2010 presidential election. Now the ruling party, LP takes pride in saying that it needs a lot of buses to accommodate its growing membership.,In a country where the political party system is a failure, politicians have the propensity to jump to the party of the incumbent president. And for good reason \u2013 the power to release government allocations lies with the executive and allies are always expected to get the bigger share of the pie. (READ: ,Rage against the (party) machine,),This is the reality that the Liberal Party is facing as it ,launched the presidential bid, of survey laggard Interior Secretary Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas II \u2013 t,he grandson and namesake of LP founder, former President Manuel Roxas.,At stake is not only Malaca\u00f1ang \u2013 and all the power that comes with the office \u2013 but the membership that will likely dwindle again if he loses. The Volkswagen joke could become LP's reality again.,The decision to endorse Roxas \"really weighed heavily\" on the President, according to his sister Ballsy Cruz. (READ: ,Mar Roxas: The long road to endorsement,),Aquino also held meetings with survey front runner, independent Senator Grace Poe, encouraging her supporters that she might get his endorsement.,RAINBOW COALITION. The administration coalition dominated the 2013 senatorial elections ,LP-NPC-NP coalition,LP now has 118 members in the House of Representatives, a few members short of securing the majority in the 291-member legislative chamber. ,Some LP members who earlier bolted the party have returned. Coalition partners, specifically the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC), also proved reliable in delivering necessary votes.,In the Senate, LP has 4 out of 24 members. But it has also been able to rely on its allies \u2013 the independent senators and members of the Nacionalista Party (NP).,Together with its allies, LP was able to lead Congress in passing landmark legislations like the Reproductive Health and Sin Tax laws. It was able to push for bold political moves like the impeachment of Corona and former Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez.,It is LP's ambitious goal to preserve this formidable alliance with NPC and NP for the 2016 polls so that the ,country's 3 biggest political parties can throw their machinery behind the candidacy of Roxas.,But the truth is, it's a very loose political alliance held together by Aquino. ,It may snap the moment Poe decides to run for president. ,Poe's supporters are hoping for a coalition between NPC and NP to back her candidacy. ,POWERHOUSE. Stalwarts of the Liberal Party during the July 31, 2015 launch of Mar Roxas' presidential bid.  ,Aquino's loyalties,That Aquino, the party chairman himself, even considered endorsing a presidential candidate outside the party speaks a lot about his loyalties to his own party. It's symptomatic of how he has regarded his party mates since his campaign in 2010.,Aquino said he is not only the leader of LP but of a coalition.,His victory in the 2010 presidential polls could not be credited to his party either. The call for him to run for president was the emotional response of a nation mourning the death of his mother, the late democracy icon and former president Corazon Aquino.,He chose not to consolidate his supporters under the LP machinery. Instead, he found it necessary to put up a parallel campaign. ,This is the root of the high-profile rivalry between the Balay (LP) and Samar factions \u2013 referring to Aquino's two headquarters in 2010 \u2013 that have competed for government posts and the ears of the President.,Still, in the end, LP prevailed. Roxas clinched the endorsement of Aquino despite his inability to raise his profile given all the opportunities to be in the limelight., ,A HANDFUL OF LP MEN: The Liberal Party opposed Charter Change moves by the Arroyo administration. Senate file photo ,Small but relevant,LP is the country's second oldest political party founded by the old Roxas, who ,was originally a member of the Nacionalista Party (NP). He and other members of the NP\u2019s so-called \u201cLiberal Wing\u201d bolted the party to form LP.,It has a long lineage of icons in Philippine politics. Among them are Senate President Jovito Salonga, the late Senator Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr and Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo.,LP also produced 4 presidents: Manuel Roxas (1946), Elpidio Quirino (1949), Diosdado Macapagal (1961), and Benigno Aquino III (2010).,But the gap between Macapagal and Aquino is almost half a century. Between the two presidents, party membership dwindled.,LP kept itself relevant through the years by coalescing with dominant parties.,In 1986, it supported Aquino\u2019s mother, Corazon, as the common candidate of the anti-Marcos political parties, although she was officially fielded by PDP-Laban. It also pledged its support to the administrations of Lakas-CMD presidents Fidel Ramos and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, even naming the latter its honorary chair and supporting her candidacy in 2004.,During the administration of President Arroyo, LP only had about 20 members in the House of Representatives. LP suffered a painful split when Sen Franklin Drilon led a faction of LP in abandoning President Arroyo at the height of allegations that she cheated to win the 2004 presidential elections.,Other members led by then Manila Mayor Lito Atieza stuck it out with Arroyo. The Commission on Elections eventually recognized Drilon\u2019s faction as the legitimate LP.,What really made LP a force to reckon with even before Aquino's electoral victory was its presence in the Senate. Among LP senators before 2010 were Mar Roxas, Drilon, Francis Pangilinan, and President Aquino himself. LP senators were always actively involved in national issues.,After the split, the LP senators were among the staunchest critics of Arroyo. Among the issues they opposed were the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain, Constitutional Assembly to favor Constitutional Convention as a mode to change the 1987 Constitution, and the midnight appointment of former Chief Justice Renato Corona.,What surveys?,Today, the LP is a formidable force. ,LP President Joseph Emilio Abaya said he is not worried about the surveys. ,\"We're upbeat, very positive. This is all towards the continuation of Daang Matuwid. We haven't seen nothing yet, as the President has said,\" Abaya said.,LP stalwarts have a plan that throws away traditional campaign theories. They said Roxas's candidacy will be about selling an ,idea, not a man. And that idea is: A vote for Roxas is a vote for the continuation of the popular presidency of Aquino. ,\"LP is a mere component of the movement,\" Abaya said.,It's a strategy that has to be absorbed first by the LP membership down the line. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

Photo by EPA/Francis Malasig,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The budget department announced on Monday, February 10, that it had released a total of P17.69 billion has already been released since December for the recovery and rehabilitation of communities devastated by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan).,One of the world\u2019s strongest typhoons, Yolanda left 6,201 dead and 28,626 injured, while 1,785 persons are still missing. As of January 29, the latest report by the national disaster response body, 1.14 million houses were damaged across several regions, and 3.4 million families have been affected. Total damage to both property and livelihood is estimated to be at P39.8 billion. (READ: ,Tacloban: In the jaws of a 'climate sandwich',),Budget Secretary Florencio Abad said among the significant releases from the P17.7 billion were the following:,\"One of the more critical components in long-term rehabilitation is the provision of adequate shelter assistance, particularly to families whose houses were formerly situated in high-risk, disaster prone areas. Several of those who unfortunately perished during the super typhoon were living in very vulnerable areas. We want to prevent future calamities from reaching the scale of Yolanda's tragic aftermath by rebuilding communities on safer ground,\" Abad said. ,Beneficiaries of the assistance for permanent housing will be determined with the help of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau. These are families that used to live in areas wiped out by storm surges, and which government scientists have since classified as no-build zones. (READ: ,Leyte fishermen say no to no-build zone,) ,The budget chief also said: \"Some of the more crucial releases we made were directed towards the restoration of basic public services, such as the rebuilding of power generation, distribution, and transmission systems, as well as the reestablishment of clean water supplies. The restoration of these services was especially time-sensitive, as the continued well-being of survivors were especially dependent on how quickly we could bring the power and water supply back up.\u201d (READ: ,Aquino on Yolanda rehab: 'Build back better',),Besides the P17.7 billion released for various infrastructure and services to the communities, the budget department also rolled out a total of P3.1 billion in December for the immediate rehabilitation of the severely damaged Tacloban Airport in Leyte.,\u201cThe extent to which the typhoon struck down economic activity in several parts of the Visayas will have serious implications on the country's growth agenda, far beyond the limits of Yolanda's destructive path,\u201d Abad said, so these will be addressed in the public expenditure in 2014.

He will set another appointment with Secretary Mar Roxas, Senator Francis Escudero, and Senator Grace Poe before his last SONA. (Photo by Camille Elemia/Rappler)  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 There were no explicit requests or appeals. The 4.5-hour meeting on Thursday, July 9, among President Benigno Aquino III, Senators Grace Poe and Francis \u201cChiz\u201d Escudero raised more questions than definitive answers for 2016.,But one thing is clear \u2013 the President has yet to decide on his \"anointed one,\" weeks ahead of his self-imposed deadline of announcing his presidential bet after his last State of the Nation Address on July 27.,\u201cMaliwanag na wala pang pasya kung sino ang kanyang ie-endorso kung meron man, dahil nagkokonsulta at kumakausap pa nga siya. Maliwanag na nahihirapan siya sa desisyon na inaatas sa kanya kaugnay ng pagpili,\u201d, Escudero said in an interview with reporters. ,(It is clear there is still no decision on the endorsements because the [President] is still consulting people. It is clear he is having a difficult time to decide.),The senator said there were no clear offers or requests from Aquino to give way to Secretary Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas II, who is the presumed standard-bearer of the administration. (READ: ,The Scrum: When a president betrays a friend,),\u201cWalang ganun to be fair to the President. Walang ganun indikasyon sa aming usapan,\u201d, Escudero said. (To be fair to the President, there was no talk of that. There were no indications.),The meeting, however, meant Aquino is expanding his choices for 2016, Escudero said. He added they talked about \u201cpermutations\u201d for the elections or possible candidates who may or may not run in 2016.,\u201cHindi siya nag-request, pinahayag niya ang kagustuhan niya. Hindi siya direktang nagsabi,\", Escudero said. (He [President Aquino] did not request anything, he just expressed his wish. He did not directly ask us.),Intact coalition,Escudero said Aquino expressed a desire for the coalition that supported him to remain \u201cintact\u201d, citing what happened in the 1992 presidential elections, when 4 presidential candidates emerged from the coalition of his mother, former president Corazon \u201cCory\u201d Aquino.,Both Escudero and Poe ran and won under Team PNoy in 2013. ,\u201cYes. The President met with us. We discussed 2016 but only to the extent of hopefully having a united ticket. No specific commitments or positions were mentioned,\u201d Poe said in a text message to reporters.,Escudero said Poe was \u201cassertive when she needed to be assertive, very frank, and candid with the President.\u201d ,Poe has insisted on her desire to remain independent, amid talks of her possible candidacy. (READ: ,Grace Poe won't join Liberal Party for 2016),Escudero admitted the meeting with Aquino would \u201cdefinitely\u201d help him decide. After all, he said, Aquino is his close friend.,\u201cSa pagtimbang ng bagay-bagay. Pagrinig derecho sa kanya kung anong nasa isip niya at opinyon niya...definitely nakatulong 'yun sa pagbubuo ng desisyon at pasya kaugnay ng pagtakbo at di pagtakbo nang nakangiti.\u201d,(In weighing things...when I heard straight from him his thoughts and opinions... Definitely it will help me in my decisions, if i should run or not.) ,Escudero, however, is uncertain if he will join the coalition for 2016, saying his decision will be based on who the standard-bearer will be.,What about Mar? ,President Aquino will set a single appointment with Roxas, Poe, and Escudero before his last SONA. ,Escudero supported Vice President Jejomar Binay in 2010, Roxas' political rival. ,But for Escudero, time may have healed all wounds.,He said \u201cpast is past\" and that he is more than willing to talk to Roxas. After all, he said Binay already dropped him and Poe in 2013. ,\u201cWala naman kaming away, di ko naman siya inaway, nagkataon lang di ko siya sinuportahan,\u201d, Escudero said. (We don't have any quarrel, I didn't fight him, it just so happened I did not support him.),Roxas, however, is mum on the issue. ,\u201cWala pa naman dumadating. May turnover para sa Armed Forces ngayong umaga. May pananghalian kami ni Pangulo pero ito naman ay long-standing na schedule,\u201d, Roxas said in an interview with reporters in Batangas. ,(No information yet.

{"content": "\nFew have heard of Jeff Horn but the unbeaten welterweight contender is confident he can pull off the upset if he faces the Filipino legend    ,UNDERDOG. Jeff Horn has emerged as a most unlikely candidate to fight Manny Pacquiao, but he's not overawed by the challenge. Photos from Horn/Pacquiao Facebooks ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Australian underdog Jeff Horn knows that many people have never heard his name before this month, but said that shouldn\u2019t be the reason why people discount his chances against Manny Pacquiao.,Horn, who is unbeaten but largely unknown outside of Australia, has been floated around as a possible opponent for the Filipino living legend, with Pacquiao\u2019s promoter and Horn\u2019s co-promoter Bob Arum scheduled to meet with Dean Lonergan of Duco Events on Tuesday (Wednesday Manila time) to discuss the possibility of a fight in Australia for April 23.,Horn\u2019s hometown of Brisbane, which holds the 52,500-capacity SunCorp Stadium, and Sydney had been mentioned as possible sites. Arum tweeted out earlier on Monday, January 9, that, aside from Australia, offers had also come in from Russia, United Kingdom and the United States to host a Pacquiao fight.,\u201cIf you hear a name that you\u2019ve never heard before thrown into the mix of these big fights, it\u2019s only natural to go \u2018Who the hell is this guy? I\u2019ve never heard of him,\u2019\u201d said Horn (16-0-1, 11 knockouts), the number two ranked contender for Pacquiao\u2019s WBO welterweight title.,\u201cI think I\u2019m ready. Ever since I first started fighting I\u2019ve jumped in the deep end straight away. This is no different for me. I can remember going to an Australian title fight before I\u2019d even started fighting and saying \u2018I reckon I beat these guys.\u2019\u201d,Horn, an Olympic quarterfinalist at the 2012 Games who holds a Bachelor of Education degree to teach secondary school from Griffith University, has built his 4-year pro career against aging veterans like Randall Bailey, Naoufel Ben Rabeh and Ali Funeka, the latter of whom Horn finished in 6 rounds last month in New Zealand as Arum watched on.,Horn\u2019s resume\u2019 pales significantly in comparison with Pacquiao (59-6-2, 38 KOs), an 8-division champion whose last 18 opponents had been former or current world champions. Horn is 3 inches taller than Pacquiao at 5-foot-9 and 10 years younger at 28.,A fight with Horn would also present Pacquiao with an opportunity to hit reset on free television after dwindling pay-per-view numbers saw him sell a reported 400,000 units for a third clash with Timothy Bradley Jr in April of 2016 and 300,000 for his most recent fight against Jessie Vargas in November of 2016.,Bigger than Manny,\u201cI think I\u2019ve got the advantage on the physical side because I\u2019m bigger than Manny. He\u2019s come up from such light weight divisions. But he\u2019s shown obviously that he can take down guys even my size,\u201d said Horn.,\u201cI think I\u2019ve got the speed, I\u2019ve got a similar style to his so I\u2019m a good mover. It\u2019s gonna be harder for him to lay those shots on me because he\u2019s fought a few guys that don\u2019t move as well.\u201d,Australia has served as a legends graveyard in recent years with Shane Mosley, Roy Jones Jr and others having lost there. Horn doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s getting a faded version of Pacquiao after watching his one-sided decision win over Vargas.,\u201cI think Pacquiao\u2019s still right up there. He hasn\u2019t lost much from where he was in his prime. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve got him at a really good time. He\u2019s still world champion, he still beat the Jessie Vargas just recently and he\u2019s a young hungry fighter. I do think he\u2019s going down a little bit and I could take advantage of that,\u201d said Horn.,Horn\u2019s trainer/manager Glenn Rushton feels the fight would be a success due to the number of Filipinos currently residing in Australia (171,233 according to the 2011 Census) and the media interest so far in the fight.,\u201cI think it\u2019ll just go gangbusters here. The media are already fully invested, they\u2019re absolutely all over it. The back page of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Courier Mail, Channel 9 has been running stories on us and will run a big documentary. The media are pushing the state and local governments to try and secure the rights,\u201d said Rushton.,All Horn and his team can do for now is wait for the news.,\u201cI look at all the world champions at the moment in the welterweight division and I see myself beating all of them at the moment. If I didn\u2019t see that I would never get past the step that I\u2019m at and I\u2019d never get a world title. The first step in boxing is believing in yourself and I believe that I can beat Manny Pacquiao or any of the other world champions that are out there right now,\u201d says Horn. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/157821-jeff-horn-i-can-beat-manny", "title": "Jeff Horn: I can beat Manny Pacquiao", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/balikbayan/156269-trump-filam-racism,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/6366-saudi-princess-tried-to-leave-luxury-hotel-without-paying,http://www.rappler.com/business/personal-finance/41796-10-money-savvy-tips-for-working-moms,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective"},
{"content": "\nNobody coordinates efforts to peacefully end the crisis in Zamboanga City, thus the prolonged and bloody standoff    ,FRIDAY THE 13TH FIRE. Two fires occur in Sta Catalina, Zamboanga City on Sept 13. Photo by Xeph Suarez,ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines \u2013 It was Friday the 13th.,September 13 was Day 5 of the standoff between government forces and followers of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) founder Nur Misuari who sought to symbolically declare independence at city hall. The break of dawn brought hopes that peace would be restored that day. After all, President Benigno Aquino III was arriving.,Inside the combat zone in Sta Catalina, Catholic priest Fr Michael Ufana \u2014 a hostage of Misuari's top commander Habier Malik \u2014 had forged an unlikely friendship with the MNLF commander. He offered to bring Malik's demands to the government for him to free all the hostages and stop fighting.,Meanwhile, barangay councilor and radio reporter Teodyver Arquiza was also waiting for calls from a \"Commander Ismael\" from the MNLF and his government contact so they could resume the previous night's operations that would complete the surrender of about 80 MNLF fighters and the release of their 38 hostages in adjacent Barangay Sta Barbara.,READ: About 80 rebels surrender,Ufana was praying he would be the instrument to end the siege. Arquiza was hoping that Thursday night's surrender would diminish the force of the MNLF and perhaps demoralize the others who would choose to remain inside the combat zone. But it would not be so.,Crisis response,A lot of things happened on Thursday night, September 12, that shaped the direction of government's response to the crisis. Members of the crisis management committee were actively negotiating with MNLF fighters to peacefully end the conflict, but the absence of clear and strong leadership made their efforts fruitless. ,The negotiators worked independently of each other and opened communication lines with the rebels. But nobody coordinated these efforts.,READ: Rappler's statement on the surrender in Zamboanga,On the ground, the chain of command wasn't as clear cut as well. Security forces were reporting to various commanders and public officials, each burdened with each sector's agenda. The crisis committee was a heavy mix of national and local figures \u2014 notably Secretary Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas II and Mayor Isabella \"Beng\" Climaco-Salazar \u2014 with very different views on how to proceed.,While the informal negotiations to peacefully end the siege were in disarray, the military was ready and waiting for the go signal to strike. City officials were prepared for a strike, too, as they issued a resolution that night ordering forced evacuation in the battle zone.,After all, in President Aquino\u2019s words, government had an \u201coverwhelming force\u201d in the city. About 4,000 troops \u2014 combined forces of the military and the police \u2014 had been deployed.,Flashback to Sta Barbara,Arquiza got involved in the negotiation because some of the MNLF's hostages are his constituents in Talon-Talon. Some members of the MNLF landed in the barangay shores, and as they marched toward city hall, they ordered people in the streets to join them. ,The MNLF shot at least two men who refused and tried to fight, Arquiza recalled. ,SAVING HIS CONSTITUENTS: Barangay councilor Teodyver Arquiza. Screenshot of television screen,The military blockade prevented the MNLF from reaching city hall, where they wanted to hoist their flag of independence. \"Commander Ismael\" and his group camped out in a Sta Barbara mosque, not too far away from Malik.,One of their hostages is a pastor, David Nifras. It was his wife who contacted Arquiza and linked him (Arquiza) to her husband. ,\"Saan ka? Kailangan ka namin dito kasi i-release na kami. Andito na kami sa labas ng mosque,\" Arquiza recalled Nifras as telling him over the phone Thursday afternoon, September 12. Arquiza demanded to talk to the MNLF commander and soon after they made the arrangement. ,The MNLF commander would turn over 38 hostages to Arquiza. After that, the rebels, mostly from the Yakan tribe of Basilan, would surrender.,Rappler was able to speak with Nifras days after, but he chose to keep quiet about what happened. He left Zamboanga to \"heal,\" he said.,The reporter in him made Arquiza ask: Why are you doing this, commander? Ismael supposedly told him, ,\"Kasi pagod na kami sa giyera. Ayaw ko na madamay [ang] mga taong ito.\", (We are tired of the fighting. I don't want these people to get involved.),Arquiza said the commander\u2019s sole demand was that he report the surrender live on radio. He did. He reported over ,Radio Mindanao Network ,(RMN) the possible release of hostages. Afterwards, he proceeded ,to Sta Barbara later that afternoon of September 12 to escort the hostages out of the battle zone. ,But he was blocked by government troops.,It's not safe, he was told. He was surprised. \"Commander Ismael\" told him they had made their own arrangements with the security forces on the ground. They were only waiting for him. That's when Arquiza called his police contact and sought help. When he didn't immediately hear from them, he went home. ,Around 9 pm of the same day, Western Mindanao police commander Chief Supt Juanito Va\u00f1o called up Arquiza and then personally fetched him from his house in Talon-Talon. Arquiza thought Va\u00f1o would bring him to Sta Barbara, but he was instead brought to the headquarters of the Westmincom, the base of the crisis management committee.,Arquiza joined the police and some \"negotiators\" who discussed the surrender. He was, however, escorted out of the room before Mayor ,Salazar arrived. ,Arquiza was transferred to the Westmincom lounge, where he stayed with police officials who knew the policemen to whom the MNLF rebels in Santa Barbara surrended, such as PNP-Special Action Force commander Director Carmelo Valmoria.  Zamboanga City police chief Senior Supt Jose Chiquito Malayo was also in the lounge.  ,(Malayo would later figure in the surrender of 23 MNLF members, mostly from the Yakan tribe of Basilan.), ,READ: Hostaged? Zambo top cop doesn't look like it,Arquiza tried to call \"Commander Ismael\" but his phone was unattended. Valmoria then called someone, apparently an intelligence officer on the ground, who transferred the call to the \"spokesman\" of \"Commander Ismael\" who identified himself as Paul Casa.,Arquiza said he was instructed to sound scared. They were checking the sincerity of the surrender. ,Arquiza waited while the cops made decisions. But it was soon almost midnight and Casa said, \u201c,Bukas na lang. Pagod na si Commander Ismael,.\u201d (Let's just do this tomorrow. Commander Ismael is tired.) ,\u201c,Medyo natagalan lang pagpunta doon kaya napagod si, Commander Ismael., Hindi natuloy,,\u201d said Arquiza. (The whole thing took awhile that's why Commander Ismael got tired. It didn't push through.),But Arquiza heard the police say, \",Wala na ito. Second option na,.\",The following day, Friday, September 13, they were supposed to try again. \"Commander Ismael\" and his government contact both called Arquiza, who waited in his house in Talon-Talon for further instructions. When he heard the heavy firing in the afternoon, he knew it was not going to happen anymore. ,Yakan tribe,Rappler reported on Thursday night, September 12, that about 80 MNLF fighters from the Yakan tribe of Basilan led by \"Commander Ismael\" surrendered to police troops in Sta Barbara. They were separate from the group in nearby Sta Catalina led by Habier Malik.,Police intelligence sources and residents in Sta Barbara told Rappler they surrendered to a small team of the Philippine National Police, the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, and the Philippine Center for Transnational Crime. ,\"A certain member of MNLF under commander Ismael with white flag reached our position and negotiated their surrender,\" according to one source on the scene. Rappler was able to speak to Casa Thursday night. He said he approached the military at around 6:30 pm to arrange a ceasefire. \"We asked if they were going to surrender, he said it's up to Commander Ismael.\",A PNP source would later say: \"They're in front of us, 70+. We dont' have the exact number of hostages.\" The PNP would also ask the rebels where Malik was. They were told he was not with them. He was \"in the next mosque towards our direction.\",The PNP began \"processing\" the surrenderees that night, but they could only do so much. They were waiting for Arquiza, who, unknown to them, was left waiting for hours at the Westmincom.,The Rappler story published on Thursday night was immediately denied by Secretary Roxas that same night, and by President Aquino the following day. The denials surprised people involved in the surrender, including Arquiza.,READ: Zambo councilor-reporter involved in surrender speaks, and ,Rappler statement on the surrender in Zamboanga,In a text message to Rappler CEO and executive editor Maria Ressa on Friday morning, Roxas said, \"There were some credible feelers last night [Thursday]. We were working on it and [they] evolved into some positive results early this morning.\",READ: 'Positive results' in nego with rebels,Inside Westmincom,What Roxas failed to talk about was the committee's indecision on Thursday night.,While Arquiza was at the Westmincom lounge that night, security officials ,were talking about how difficult it would be to process surrenderees in the evening.,Jesuit priest Fr Albert Alejo, handpicked by Mayor Salazar to coordinate efforts to resolve the standoff, said he ,overheard Valmoria and Va\u00f1o discuss the \u201csurrender of a lot of people\u201d and that it was declared a \"no go.\",\",Ito na lang kay Father, doable,,\" Alejo overheard the police commanders telling each other. They were referring to Fr Ufana.,Alejo also overheard the officials ,say, \",Hirap i-process 'yan. Gabi na,. That\u2019s not possible. We need a lot of back-up. ,Times 3 ng sundalo. Kung may bakbakan pala. 'Yun pala may dalang granada. Bakit gusto may media? Delikado,.\",(It will be difficult to process them. It's already dark. It's not possible. We need a lot of back-up \u2013 3 times the number of soldiers already deployed there. What if there's a firefight? What if they have a grenade? Why are they asking for the media? It's dangerous.),Alejo said he didn't know what group they were talking about then and that he only faintly overheard the conversation. He said he would later ask Va\u00f1o about the surrender of the 80 MNLF fighters. \"It did not happen,\" he was told.,In Sta Catalina ,Alejo, who had been in touch with Malik himself, presented the commander\u2019s demands for the release of Fr Ufana. Malik was asking for 500 food packs and an ambulance so the government could get from the battle zone two dead MNLF fighters and bury them. ,Alejo, Va\u00f1o, and Valmoria fought over the 500 food packs. They eventually reduced the number to 200. They also agreed to send a couple from Jolo to fetch Ufana. But it was soon 3 am and Valmoria said, \u201cMadilim pa raw kasi. Delikado.\" (It's still dark.

This time though, the Court allowed the audio livestream because of public interest in the issue.,\u201cNow, on this particular occasion, we felt that because the issues are in fact very, well, they're gut level issues, people are angry, people are definitely taking a position one way or another on PDAF and because it is national in scope, there are a lot of people involved in the issue.\u201d,\u201cThe Court felt it was important that people could hear what was going on and hear it real time.

All of these things will be used for, lalo na sa (especially the) intelligence fund,\u201d Duterte said on August 25.,Again, no one from among the representatives had any inquiries for Medialdea after his presentation, marking the end of the hearing after 10 minutes.,Albay 1st District Representative Edcel Lagman, however, manifested that he has several inquiries about the OP budget, but he would reserve his questions during the House plenary deliberations.,\u201cWhat we did was to follow tradition that interpellations are not asked during the budget presentation of the Office of the President and the Office of the Vice President,\u201d explained Lagman, who is part of the so-called \u201cLegitimate 8\u201d minority bloc in the House.,\u201cBut that rule or tradition does not extend to the plenary session where we could ask questions for interpellations,\u201d he added.,The House committee on appropriations continues its budget hearings on other government offices this week.,No schedule has been announced yet for the House plenary deliberations of the ,P3.35-trillion proposed budget , for 2017. \u2013 ,with a report from Pia Ranada/Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/146051-house-appropriations-committee-budget-office-of-the-president-office-of-the-vice-president", "title": "No questions asked: Congressmen hear OP, OVP budgets within minutes", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/ph-travel/133388-visayas-travel-destinations-beaches-falls-caves,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/166467-arnel-pineda-meets-journey-singer-steve-perry,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/nation/143136-office-president-budget-2017,http://www.rappler.com/business/144763-asean-op-budget-asean-summit-2017"},

{"content": "\nA Unicef report says the Philippines is the 5th country worldwide with the most cases of low birthweight infants    , ,MOTHER AND CHILD. The nutritional status of mothers before and during pregnancy can have short-term and long-term impacts on their children. Photo by Akira Liwanag/EPA,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Philippines is the 5,th, country in the world with the most cases of low birthweight infants, according to a 2013 report by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (Unicef).,This is a consequence of poor nutrition among women before and during pregnancy.,The World Health Organization (WHO) says that low birthweight babies are at more risk of health problems manifested not only during early development stages but also until adulthood.,If this trend persists, not only women and children are put in peril, but also the entire country\u2019s future workforce. ,The lack of investment in women\u2019s health may result in a weak, sickly, and dull population, ultimately putting a strain on the Philippine economy, education, and development.,At present, it seems that the long road to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 \u2013 including the improvement of women\u2019s and children\u2019s health \u2013 will be a bumpy one.,Double responsibility, ,\u201cThe health and survival of mothers and their newborns are linked,\u201d Unicef stressed.,A pregnant woman must satisfy not only her own nutritional requirements but also those of the growing fetus in her womb.,Her nutritional status affects her child\u2019s health at birth. This crucial period can also determine growth and development in the years to come.,All of the baby\u2019s nutrition needs come from the mother. ,Insufficient nutrition could lead to different problems such as stunting which refers not only to hindered physical growth, but also to impaired cognitive abilities. Stunting refers to having a lower height for one's age and is caused by long-term insufficient nutrient intake. It occurs before the age of two and its effects are irreversible.,Unicef reported that 80% of the world\u2019s stunted children live in 14 countries, among which the Philippines ranked No. 9,. ,As of 2011, 33.6% of Filipino children under 5 years old were stunted., ,During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body prioritizes the baby\u2019s nutrition needs.,For example, if the mother is anemic, her hemoglobin count may further drop since the baby inside her also needs hemoglobin for oxygenation. This may compromise the health of both mother and baby.,Unicef advises mothers to receive micronutrient supplements, extra food and fluids \u201cto rebuild their own nutrient stores.\u201d,Pregnant women should focus on their health and nutrition needs to prevent difficult labor and complications such as severe hemorrhage, infections, high blood pressure, and abscesses of the breasts, according to the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (FNRI-DOST).,Pregnant and nutritionally at risk ,In the Philippines, one out of every 4 pregnant women is nutritionally at risk, ,FNRI-DOST reported in its most recent survey in 2011.,Close to one-fourth or 23.5% of pregnant mothers with children 0-5 years old are also at risk and 11.8% of lactating mothers are underweight, the same survey said.,AT RISK. 1/4 of all pregnant Filipino women are nutritionally at risk. Source: FNRI-DOST Updating of NNS 2011,These figures barely changed in the past decade, reflecting the country\u2019s slow progress in improving the health and nutritional status of pregnant women., ,Poorly nourished mothers will also most likely give birth to low birthweight infants \u2013 those weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth.,Low birth weight,LOW BIRTHWEIGHT. The Philippines ranks 5th in the world for having the most cases of low birthweight infants. Source: UNICEF Global Nutrition Database 2012,The incidence of low birthweight exceeded 20% in the Philippines; the same was observed in India and Pakistan, according to Unicef. ,The figure is alarming, considering that these unhealthy infants will someday grow to be our society\u2019s backbone.,This can also have adverse effects on the economy. WHO suggests that low birth weight results in \u201csubstantial costs to the health sector and imposes a significant burden on society as a whole.\u201d,According to FNRI-DOST, 20.2% of Filipino children under 5 years old were underweight in 2011. The MDG target is to reduce this number to 17.3% in 2015. The probability of the Philippines achieving this goal is said to be \"medium.\",The Philippines is the 10,th, country in the world most affected by wasting or having low weight for one\u2019s height. Wasting is an acute form of malnutrition and increases the risk of death among children.,In 2011, 7.3% of Filipino children under 5 years old suffered from wasting.,Making the right food choices,Milagrina Jacinto, president of the Department of Health (DOH) League of Licensed Nutritionist-Dietitians Inc. and head of the Nutrition and Dietetics Service of the Quirino Memorial Medical Center (QMMC), emphasized the importance of eating the right quality and quantity of food during pregnancy.,\u201cPregnancy is a crucial period. The mother is not only feeding herself, but also the baby inside her womb,\u201d Jacinto said.,Jacinto clarified the misconception that eating healthy means spending more money. \u201cIn terms of quality, it doesn\u2019t mean you eat the most expensive food. For example, you can substitute meat with other protein-rich foods such as legumes like ,monggo,, or with tofu, eggs, or fish. The nutrients are important, not the price.\u201d,Families may grow fruits, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables such as ,kangkong, malunggay,, and sweet potatoes in their backyards. These simple yet nutritious foods can contribute to the strengthening of the immune system.,Giving pregnant mothers food and micronutrients would improve their nutritional status as well as store the micronutrients necessary for their fetuses and eventually, their newborns.,Well-informed, well-nourished,A well-informed and well-nourished mother can better nourish her baby.,Education also plays a vital role in keeping a country healthy. Everyone, not just mothers, must be aware of their nutrition needs as well as the simplest and best ways to meet those needs.,Jacinto said government hospitals, like QMMC, offer free programs that educate pregnant women, such as counseling services, one-on-one consultations with nutritionist-dietitians, and forums and lectures on pregnancy, health and nutrition.,Because hospitals and LGUs vary in the free services they offer, the public must not hesitate to ask what these programs are.,Pregnant women, Jacinto added, should inquire about maternal care programs, antenatal care, post-partum care, immunizations, feeding programs, micronutrient supplementations, and other services available in their community.,The government, together with schools, local government units (LGUs), the media, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private sectors, and the general public must work together in raising health and nutrition awareness, Jacinto said. ,\u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/48039-hunger-during-pregnancy", "title": "Hungry and pregnant in the Philippines", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/57725-violations-milk-code,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/54282-young-poor-pregnant-ph,http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/33688-survey-pregnant-mothers-nutrition-risk"},

We need the sea.),Weeks after Yolanda, the government began imposing a ,no-build zone measure, that would prohibit the building of structures within 40 meters from the shoreline. Storm surges that reached 100 m inland proved that living right by the sea is not safe. Many of the casualties in Leyte were due to storm surges devastating coastal communities.,But the no-build-zone rule does not sit well with fishermen who need to be close to the sea in order to pursue their livelihood. (,IN PHOTOS: Rebuilding lives inside the 'no-build' zone,),Fishermen need their boats near the sea. In fishing communities, most fishermen have their boats by the doorways of their homes. They need only push them across the sand to get to the shore a few meters away.,For fishermen whose fathers were also fishermen before them, it has been this way for generations, even through storms and rough waves.,Following the no-build zone rule, the barangay captain wants to move the fishermen nearer the barangay center \u2013 far away from their boats and the sea.,\u201c,Napakalayo.

President Benigno Aquino III is set to endorse Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II this week. Malaca\u00f1ang file photo  ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 It has been a long journey full of meetings, consultations, and vague answers to clear-cut questions but within the week, all roads will lead to Club Filipino in San Juan City, where President Benigno Aquino III will finally endorse his bet for the 2016 presidential elections.,Several sources privy to the plans of Malaca\u00f1ang and the ruling Liberal Party (LP) have confirmed to Rappler that Aquino is set to endorse Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II as his bet for the 2016 elections at the Club Filipino on Friday, July 31 at 9 am.,Roxas is not expected to announce his running mate during the declaration. ,The same personalities \u2013 allies of the ruling LP, particularly those who have remained loyal to Roxas \u2013 are expected to crowd Club Filipino when the endorsement happens.,It will be a flashback to 2009, when Roxas, then set to be the LP\u2019s standard-bearer for the 2010 presidential polls, slid down at the last minute for Aquino, whose popularity surged after the death of his mother, democracy icon and former president Cory Aquino.,Aquino earlier said he would ,announce his choice, for the standard-bearer of the LP-led coalition after his last ,State of the Nation Address, (SONA) on Monday, July 27. Although he hinted in mid-July that he might ,make an earlier announcement,, it now appears that things will still go according to plan.,Meetings with Poe, Escudero,The road that led to Club Filipino was long and winding.,Aquino, explaining that he was not merely the leader of the LP but of the groups it coalesced with, has been in hours-long conversations with political allies.,Aquino met with neophyte ,Senator Grace Poe,, currently the leader in presidential preference polls, at least 4 times in the past few months.,STILL A GO? Senator Grace Poe and Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II. File photo ,For a while, it seemed as though Aquino was having a hard time picking between Roxas and Poe. The senator and her close friend, Senator Francis Escudero, had said as much in ,interviews with the media,.,But in late July, Poe, in a statement to media, hinted that talks between herself and the LP, as represented by the President, had either ,faltered or hit a road block,.,The President\u2019s impending endorsement of Roxas became clearer in his final SONA, where he ,heaped praises, on Roxas.,\u201cTo Secretary Mar Roxas: whether you are in or out of government, the enemies of the Straight Path have not stopped criticizing you. Because you count, because your words matter, they have continued to do their best to put you down; Through their constant attacks on your character, your critics themselves have proven that they are afraid of your integrity, skill, and ability to do the job. It\u2019s only because they have nothing to boast of that they\u2019re trying to bring you down. Mar, you are proving: You can\u2019t put a good man down. Just as my mother and father had faith, so too should you have faith that our countrymen know who truly puts country before self.\u201d,\u2013 President Benigno Aquino III on Mar Roxas during the 2015 SONA,But not all of the Aquino administration\u2019s allies are sold on Roxas. There are some who have been pushing for Poe because of her survey numbers.,Unlike Poe, Roxas has been lagging behind in early preference surveys, placing 3rd or 4th. Trailing Poe is opposition leader Vice President Jejomar Binay, who continues to be hounded by allegations of corruption.,Some LP allies, however, insist that popularity should not be the end-all-be-all in picking a standard-bearer.,\u201cWinnability is important. But popularity and winnability aren\u2019t the only ingredients needed. We need to take into consideration integrity, competence, and experience,\u201d Quezon City Representative Jorge Banal told reporters in a previous interview.,For Banal and a lot of LP members, a Roxas-Poe tandem would have been \u2013 or still is \u2013 a dream ticket.,Of ghost months and superstitions,Aquino\u2019s plan of announcing his bet only after the SONA made some pro-Roxas politicians anxious. The schedule meant they only had 4 days before July ended, and the dreaded \u201cghost month\u201d of August would begin.,The month of August is considered unlucky by the more superstitious Filipinos, and people are cautioned against starting new things during the ghost month \u2013 a presidential bid included. Aquino, according to those close to him, is a fervent believer in the inauspicious nature of August.,Both of Aquino\u2019s parents died in August \u2013 his father, martyred Senator Benigno Aquino Jr, died on August 21, 1983; his mother Cory died on August 1, 2009. The young Aquino nearly lost his life on August 28, 1987, during a coup attempt against his mother.,His former Cabinet official, interior secretary Jesse Robredo, also died in a plane crash on August 18, 2012. ,Mar Roxas joins President Benigno Aquino III during a trip to Zamboanga city. File photo by Gil Nartea/Malacanang Photo Bureau ,Had Aquino remained undecided by the time August rolled in, that meant the LP and its allies would have to wait until September for an endorsement of a standard-bearer.,Sources told Rappler that Roxas\u2019 team blocked off July 29, 30, and 31 for a possible endorsement date. July 28 was ruled out because Aquino would be exhausted from the July 27 SONA; the President himself said on Monday he was not feeling well.,Thursday, July 30, was an unlikely choice because of the scheduled ,Metro Manila-wide earthquake drill,. ,People close to Roxas, his wife and broadcast Korina Sanchez included, also happen to be believers in the bad tidings of announcements and decisions made during the ghost month.,\u201cIf we wait until after August, that would be advantageous to Poe,\u201d conceded one LP ally.,The month of August will be another crucial period for presidential aspirants. Polling firms are set to conduct surveys towards the end of the month, and are set to release the results by September.,2016-2022,Courting Poe to be Roxas\u2019 running mate isn\u2019t just about eliminating a threat or riding on her popularity come 2016.,For LP members, it\u2019s also about making sure the administration\u2019s \u201c,Daang Matuwid ,(Straight Path)\u201d \u2013 its tagline for its transparency, anti-corruption and good governance platform \u2013 is in place for 12 more years.,The continuation of reforms has been a recurring theme in many of Aquino\u2019s speeches. After touting his administration\u2019s accomplishments during his last SONA, the President again emphasized the importance of choosing ,Daang Matuwid, and shunning the country\u2019s so-called old ways.,\u201cOn the other hand, if we return to the crooked path, we will be condemned to waiting for nothing. We will once again be left behind, and the upward trajectory of our economy will reach a premature end.,We have indeed planted impressive reform; and we have already nourished them with intense effort and sacrifice. Who in their right mind would decide to cut the tree down on a whim, when we have only begun harvesting its fruits?,There is a sentiment that I want to share with you; it is best captured in the question: \u201cWill we lose all that we have built\u2014all that we have worked hard for\u2014in one election?\u201d From this perspective, the next election will be a referendum for the Straight and Righteous Path. You will decide whether the transformation we are experiencing today will be permanent, or simply a brief and lucky deviation from a long history of failure.\u201d,- President Benigno Aquino III in his final SONA,The idea is for Roxas to continue and build on existing reforms and programs from 2016 until 2022, followed by a Poe administration until 2028.,An extra 6 years, members of the LP argue, would do well for Poe, who has barely reached the 3rd year of her 6-year term as senator.,But Poe, in previous interviews, dismissed that notion. She claimed that experience did not help past vice presidents who became presidents to do well in office \u2013 an apparent reference to former presidents Joseph Estrada and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.,Poe is said to be gearing for her own presidential bid, with campaign headquarters to boot. Roxas\u2019 campaign team, meanwhile, has been quietly fixing up \u201cBalay,\" the LP\u2019s headquarters, for the interior secretary\u2019s 2016 campaign.,Should Poe push through with a presidential bid even without the President's endorsement, even those allied with the administration are doubtful that the LP-led coalition will remain intact. ,With an endorsement in the bag and only a final date left hanging, the journey to 2016 \u2013 and to Malaca\u00f1ang \u2013 begins for Roxas and the Liberal Party.,Will the road be as bumpy as 2010? ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

That job is not for those who are not prepared. I cannot really say, but things like this are not planned.),Poe added: \",Ngayon lamang ay nag-iisip akong mabuti.

In this file photo, President Duterte is joined by Vice President Robredo in remembering the victims of Super Typhoon Yolanda. File photo by Karl Alonzo/Presidential Photo  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Malaca\u00f1ang cited \",irreconcilable differences,\" between President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo as the main reason for the President's decision to stop her from attending future Cabinet meetings. ,Those differences have been apparent since the President assumed office in June this year.  Robredo, in her December 5 resignation letter, conceded as much. \"I have exerted all effort to put aside our differences, maintain a professional working relationship, and work effectively despite the constraints because the Filipino people deserve no less,\" she wrote to Duterte. (READ: ,Full text: Robredo's resignation letter,),While Robredo has said that she shared with Duterte the same vision for the country, she never hesitated to declare contrary positions on key policies and pronouncements made by Duterte. (READ: ,SONA 2016: Robredo, Duterte 'share common direction',) ,Two huge issues issues set them apart: the government's conduct of its war on drugs, and Duterte's decision allowing the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery.,And there's one person who stands between them, too: defeated vice presidential candidate Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. After winning the presidency in June, Duterte initially said he would, not give Robredo any Cabinet position, because this could \"hurt Bongbong's feelings.\" But he later ,gave Robredo the housing portfolio,. In a trip to China recently, Duterte brought Bongbong Marcos with him and introduced him to Filipinos there as possibly the country's next vice president. (READ: ,If Marcos wins protest, 'maybe we'll have new VP',),Below are the key policy differences of Duterte and Robredo:,1. War on drugs,Since the President launched his war on drugs, more than 5,869 Filipinos have been killed, based on the ,latest figures, from the Philippine National Police (PNP). At least 2,028 were killed in police operations while 3,841 were victims of extrajudicial killings.,As early as July, Robredo urged the public to be vigilant toward the ,rising number of casualties,, reiterating her stand that the rule of law must prevail.,In a speech before the PNP on August 22, she asked the police to \",do what is right,\" in fighting drugs. She said: \"It's not about deciding who dies or who lives. It's also about making sure that when the fighting dies down, what's left is a community that trusts more than fears.\",And while the government was keen on building drug rehabilitation centers across the country, Robredo said the money could be put to better use elsewhere, saying only 10% of the 700,000 surrenderers of the anti-narcotics campaign are in need of medical intervention. Majority of the surrenderers must be re-integrated back through a ,community-based rehabilitation program,, she said. (READ: ,Robredo: Family, church key in nat'l drug rehab program,) ,2. Age of criminal liability,During the presidential campaign, Duterte pushed for the amendment of the juvenile justice law by lowering the age of criminal liability from 15 years old to 12 years old.,This found support at the House of Representatives under ,Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez ,with the filing of a bill amending the age of criminal responsibility to 9 years old. (READ: ,Children in conflict with the law: Cracks in Juvenile Justice Act,) ,Robredo is opposed to this.,3. Reviving death penalty,Duterte wants to restore capital punishment. In a private meeting with lawmakers in Davao City last July, Duterte asked them to ,pass the measure,, explaining that the revival of the death penalty would help his campaign against illegal drugs.,Alvarez and Senator Manny Pacquiao have filed bills supporting this.,Robredo, a former human rights lawyer, has been firm in her position ,against the death penalty,, emphasizing the United Nations' declaration that every person has the rigth to life. Various studies, she said, have also debunked the correlation between death penalty and lower crime rates.,4. Moratorium on land use,Last September, Duterte approved Agrarian Reform Secretary Rafael Mariano's proposal to impose a ,two-year moratorium on land conversion,. Mariano said this would immediately protect more than 4.7 million hectares of agricultural land that have already been awarded to farmer-beneficiaries.,But, Robredo joined other government units ,such as the National Economic and Development Authority, Department of Finance, and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) in blocking this move. The then housing chief argued that a moratorium would \"further delay the housing and resettlement processes\" since most of the lands available are agriculture.,5. Women's rights,Although the President has no specific national policy on women's rights, he has been widely criticized for how he's been treating women publicly. During the election period, he drew flak for joking about the ,rape of an Australian missionary,. (READ: ,Duterte needs training on gender, anger management - Robredo,) ,Robredo has also been at the ,receiving end ,of his sexist remarks. The President has ,called her beautiful, on various public events, and she let them pass. But the ,Vice President drew the line, when Duterte teased her about ,wearing a short skirt, during his speech commemorating the anniversary of Super Typhoon Yolanda.,6. Foreign relations,The President has committed to an ,independent foreign policy,, slamming US President Barack Obama, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and the European Union (EU). He has repeatedly said that the country can survive ,without foreign aid,.,A long-time non-governmental organization (NGO) worker, Robredo said that it is best to maintain the Philippines' good foreign relations because the country, benefits from these bodies' assistance on anti-poverty programs,.,Robredo also transformed the Office of the Vice President into a more advocacy-based agency, linking poor local government units (LGUs) to aid groups. They are currently in partnership with the UN, EU and the Asian Development Bank.,7. Marcos burial,This is perhaps the most divisive issue confronting the Duterte administration, and Robredo is the highest ranking leader to oppose him over it. Duterte allowed the burial of Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, triggering protests from various groups that went to the Supreme Court to question the decision. The SC voted in favor of Duterte in a ,November 8 verdict. ,Marcos was buried in a ,secret ceremony on November 18,.,Robredo, who defeated the late President's son and namesake, former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr, in the last vice presidential race, denounced the ruling, arguing that it was not \"consistent with morality.\" She described the secret burial as a move by a  \",thief in the night,.\",Secretary to the Cabinet Leoncio \"Jun\" Evasco Jr explained that Robredo's stance on the issue had nothing to do with the President's decision barring her from Cabinet meetings. But Robredo considered the move as part of efforts to ,steal the vice presidency from her.,Marcos has a ,pending electoral protest, against her before the SC, which acts as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal.

It acts as a markethehing arm of the DA in the acquisition and distribution of farm outputs.,We have focused our research on this government-owned and -controlled corporation after whistleblower Benhur Luy identified it as one of at least 3 government entities through which alleged scam brains Napoles usually accessed the PDAF of senators and congressmen.,READ: ,Pork barrel 'queen' parties with solons,From 2007 to 2011, COA noted that a combined P1.35 billion of PDAF from at least 49 senators and congressmen went to NGOs that:,In a number of cases, NGOs got several PDAF releases \u2013 with one getting as many as 10 in an election season.,The NGOs got these from congressmen from districts that were not in the same regions, suggesting that their pork barrel might not have been used for their constituents.,Of the 26 NGOs that state auditors questioned, only 11 were in existence \u2013 at least, on paper, according to their incorporation records at the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2013 years before the 5-year period audited by COA.,Four do not have incorporation records at all, although 2 of them have names bearing big similarities with NGOs registered with the SEC.,The rest of the NGOs were incorporated only shortly before they availed themselves of the lawmakers\u2019 pork barrel.,The 7 NGOs with interlocking interests and the amount of PDAFs they received over 5 years were the:,Of these 7, Social Development Program for Farmers Foundation Inc and People\u2019s Organization for Progress and Development Foundation have whistleblower Benhur Luy as an incorporator and officer, indicating its link to Napoles.,The two other NGOs on the list that Luy said was created by Napoles (but didn\u2019t have Luy as incorporator) are:,In all, Napoles\u2019 4 NGOs got 12 PDAF releases through Nabcor totalling P405.02 million. They comprised 30% of the total released to questionable NGOs. In fact, the amounts received by Social Development and Masaganang Ani were the first and third highest amounts, respectively, that went to NGOs.,The following names were listed as incorporators and officers of multiple NGOs questioned by COA:,Senators\u2019 pork,Rappler also noted interesting releases during election seasons.,In 2007, PDAFs were released to NGOs less than two months before the May 14, 2007, polls, which was in violation of the election ban. A single release amounted to P23 million just five days before the elections.,In the 2009-2010 audit, Kabuhayan at Kalusugang Alay sa Masa Foundation Inc got 10 releases amounting to P65.96 million.,Senators\u2019 pork barrel releases carried interesting stories as well.,In 2009-2010, two senators \u2013 Edgardo Angara and Juan Ponce Enrile \u2013 allocated their PDAF of P20 million and P15 million, respectively, to an NGO that was formed only in 2009.,The group therefore had no track record, in violation of COA rules.,Senator Jinggoy Estrada released a total of P9.7 million to the Quezon City-based MAMFI in two tranches in 2010. COA noted irregularities in the transaction as well as project implementation.,The check issued for P8.245 million representing 85 % of the project cost was not submitted for audit. Two persons without authorization from the NGO received the checks issued by Nabcor.,Senator Ramon \u201cBong\u201d Revilla allocated P9.7 million \u2013 interestingly, the same amount requested by another group from Senator Estrada \u2013 to St. James the Apostle Multi-Purpose Cooperative.,This was \u201cdespite its failure to comply with the requisites for entitlement to government funds,\u201d the COA said. The audit agency also found out that the money was deposited to a Land Bank account in Quezon City.,\u201cHowever, there was no proof submitted that the said account belongs to the Cooperative.\u201d Ninety percent of the total project was immediately released to the cooperative shortly after signing of the MOA between the cooperative and Revilla\u2019s office.,READ: ,Admin solons linked to pork barrel scam,Pattern of anomalies,A common anomaly cited by COA among Nabcor\u2019s beneficiary NGOs was that they had offices outside the project sites. COA rules require that the NGO should be based in the community where it is implementing a project.  ,For example, the office of Napoles\u2019 Social Development Program for Farmers\u2019 Foundation is located in Bi\u00f1an, Laguna, but its supposed projects were based in Sarangani, Agusan del Sur, Benguet, South Cotabato, Pangasinan, Lanao del Sur, and Masbate.,COA also found that checks issued by Nabcor to the same NGOs were deposited in different account numbers. This may corroborate claims by former employees of  Napoles that they deposited money to Napoles\u2019s personal bank accounts.,Some of the NGOs failed to submit a list of beneficiaries.,READ: ,Palace: NGOs asking for PDAF to be vetted,As early as its 2008 audit report, COA found that \u201cthere were no list of beneficiaries\u201d provided by 17 NGOs that received the pork barrel that year. There were no inspection reports or certificates of project completion.,Despite these deficiencies, however, 8 NGOs continued to receive pork barrel for 2009 and 2010. Napoles\u2019 Social Development and Masaganang Ani.,In its recommendations in the 2011 report, COA issued a \u201cnotice of suspension\u201d to all the NGOs covered in the 2009-2010 audit.

The first meeting happened before Holy Week, and the second just before President Benigno Aquino III left for Canada.,The meeting before Holy Week was only between Roxas, Senator Poe, and her husband, according to Roxas. The \"success\" of the first meeting led to a second, this time with Aquino, which was held in Malaca\u00f1ang on May 5. (READ: ,Poe asked Aquino: Will you support me?,),Roxas did not delve into the details of the meetings, only telling reporters that the discussions went well.,\u201c,Maganda ang usapan tungkol sa daang matuwid, paano natin mapapalakas at mapapatibay ito,,\u201d said Roxas on Tuesday.

Asked about the party\u2019s timeline, Roxas said their plans will become clear in the \u201cnext few weeks or months.\u201d,Roxas planned to run for president in 2010 under LP, but slid down for Aquino, whose numbers were boosted by the death of his mother, former president and EDSA revolution icon Corazon Aquino. ,Instead, Roxas ran for vice president and eventually lost to now Vice President Jejomar Binay. He has yet to confirm his plans for the coming elections, despite the pronouncements of both his allies and rivals in politics.,Long meeting ,On Monday, Poe told reporters she had a \u201clong meeting\u201d with Aquino on May 5 at Malaca\u00f1ang and that Roxas joined the \u201clast part\u201d of the huddle.,Poe added it was \u201cclear\u201d that the President is already thinking about the 2016 polls and \u201csomeone [the Liberal Party] can support who has the trust of the people, and has the chance to push for their reforms.\u201d Poe added Aquino was looking for an \u201calternative.\u201d,The interior secretary refused to comment on \u201cwhat [Poe] said or didn\u2019t say,\u201d but emphasized that the meeting went well.,\u201c,Lahat naman tayo na nag-nanais na magkaroon ng continuity itong Daang Matuwid, itong magandang nangyayari sa ating bansa, ay dapat matuwa na nangyari ang meeting na ito,,\u201d he said. (Anyone who wants the Straight Path, the improvements in our country to continue, should be happy this meeting happened.),Nothing concrete was discussed in their meetings, at least when it comes to the elections, Roxas said. \u201c,Pag-uusap lang naman ito. Ang pinakamahalaga, ang pinaka-pundasyon ay ang prinsipyo,,\u201d he said. (This is just a discussion. What\u2019s important is you\u2019re grounded on common principles.),\u201c,Palagay ko ang mga kababayan natin, marunong naman sila, marunong silang kumilatis sa kakayahan, sa karanasan, sa kalinisan ng kung sino man ang pipiliin nila,,\u201d he added. (I think our fellow Filipinos know how to scrutinize a candidate\u2019s capability, experience, good track record when it comes to picking their bet.),The man who defeated Roxas in 2010 is also the leading candidate for president in 2016: Binay.

{"content": "\nCongressmen allied with the President wonder if there's anyone else the Liberal Party can endorse in 2016, amid concerns that Interior Secretary Mar Roxas is not a viable candidate     ,WINNABLE? Allies of the President wonder if Interior Secretary Mar Roxas is the right person for President Benigno Aquino III to anoint. Photo by Mike Alquinto/DILG,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 In the House of Representatives, there's unease among key allies of President Benigno Aquino III. They are worried about 2016.,\u201cIs it really going to be Mar?\u201d allies ask each other, referring to presumed Liberal Party (LP) standard bearer, Interior Secretary Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas II. \u201cIs there really nobody else?\u201d,Congressmen are beginning to lose hope that Roxas still has a fighting chance in the 2016 presidential race. Opposition candidate and Vice President Jejomar Binay \u2013 who has long ago announced his intent to run for president \u2013 appears formidable with his soaring approval ratings. Roxas' numbers, meanwhile, are going the opposite direction. ,In the ,latest Pulse Asia survey,, Binay topped a list of 11 names of possible candidates, with 41% of respondents saying they would vote for the Vice President. Roxas was in 5th place, with only 7% picking him as their first choice. And with the ,scrapping of the Priority Development Assistance Fund ,(PDAF) \u2013 discretionary funds allotted to lawmakers which they have used in the past to secure votes \u2013 it is not difficult to understand why congressmen allied with his party are nervous about 2016.,Aquino's allies in the House of Representatives are \"looking at options\" as early as now, and starting talks with other parties in anticipation of 2016, according to a legislator supportive of the President. Convinced that the LP has no viable candidate at the moment, nor could government fund allocations such as the PDAF, legislators are concerned about their own welfare.,\u201cEveryone wants to be on the right side. There's a growing sentiment that when you're aligned with the party [in power] it's easier for you,\u201d the legislator told Rappler. \u201cBut there's a prevailing sentiment that [Mar] is not winnable.\u201d,In Malaca\u00f1ang, 2016 is also top of mind for the President. Along with the creation of the Bangsamoro, the rehabilitation of Yolanda-hit areas, and his commitment to inclusive growth, picking his successor is also a point of concern for the Chief Executive. His recent speeches are clues.,Aquino often ,weaves in an appeal to the public, \u2013 at groundbreaking ceremonies and holiday appearances, business gatherings and provincial visits \u2013 to \u201cpick a leader who will continue and further improve the reforms we've made,\u201d and to ask the people for vigilance against those who \u201cwant to return to the old system.\u201d,He's concerned that the next president will put his reforms to waste, if it's someone who is not allied with him. Thus, his constant message of continuity.,\u201cThey don't show it, but they're worried about the surveys,\u201d a Malaca\u00f1ang source close to the President told Rappler.,Hopeful for Mar,The President's choice for 2016, as of today, is Roxas, who in 2010 gave up his presidential ambitions for Aquino.,Roxas is well-educated, with an impressive academic background. He is a Wharton graduate, the grandson of a former president, and the son of a retired senator. He has ample government experience and has a clean record when it comes to handling government funds. In short, Roxas is the perfect successor. ,(READ: ,Why there's no giving up on Mar Roxas,),The LP's strategy is to bring Roxas to a respectable position in surveys and hope that Aquino's endorsement will further push him to a comfortable distance from Binay. The problem is, ,Aquino's ratings are at their lowest, since the beginning of his term.,Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, a key Roxas supporter, is confident that the numbers will change, and that much can happen in two years. They expect that after Aquino's State of the Nation Address, and the administration's explanation about the ,Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) that was declared partly unconstitutional by the Supreme Court,, the President's numbers will rise again. And probably so would Roxas'.,\u201cThere was an abnormal blip after DAP and PDAF. He will recover,\u201d Abad said, blaming the drop in Aquino\u2019s numbers on a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d by those who want to deflect themselves from the PDAF issue and those who have an axe to grind with the administration.,'SURVEYS CAN CHANGE'. Secretary Mar Roxas' allies say the reception of Roxas on the ground is warm, and believe surveys can change. File photo by DILG,LP stalwart and Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya also told Rappler the focus is on the programs of the President \u2013 which they believe will be more than enough to sway votes come 2016 \u2013 and insisted the surveys \"don't worry us.\",But to some politicians and strategists allied with Aquino, this is beginning to sound like wishful thinking.,Proof of this is the level of activity and buzz at the Liberal Party headquarters in Balay, the family residence of Roxas.,Roxas invites his party mates in Congress for gatherings every first Monday of the month. There they talk about issues, the party\u2019s various positions, projects of regions, and the party\u2019s structure, among others. According to the legislator source, the number of lawmakers who go to these meetings have steadily begun to decrease. Casual endorsements for Roxas by the handful of die-hard allies have been met with little enthusiasm by the majority, and sometimes tension, if not awkwardness.,Aquino's struggle,The struggle to find a viable successor is real to the extent that it has influenced some of the President's recent actions.,Driven by the desire to pass important bills before he leaves office, Aquino understands his influence over legislators is diminishing as days go by, especially with less than two years left in his term. , ,Wanting to ensure he doesn't lose any support for his other significant bills and reform initiatives, and in fear of becoming a lame duck president, Aquino in mid-August dropped a bomb: from being adamantly opposed to touching the Constitution, ,he suddenly suggested an openness to a second term., The Constitution \u2013 established during the presidency of his mother and democracy icon Corazon Aquino \u2013 \u00adcurrently prohibits a president from running for re-election after one 6-year term.,Aquino never meant it.,\u201cThe second term idea was never serious,\u201d a Malaca\u00f1ang official close to the President said.,The same source explained that the pronouncement of a second term was only to \u201cprovoke the other side\u201d and \u201cto confuse them,\u201d to make Binay\u2019s camp slow down on their campaign aggression. It was an attempt to soften up the opposition and make them think twice about attacking the President, in addition to ensuring his allies stay faithful to him.,If Aquino's camp knew they had a strong candidate to begin with, talks of a second term would never have even been floated.,Even in Congress, the President's statements on a possible second term had little credibility and was met with confusion.,Asked whether Aquino floating the idea of a second term worked to keep congressmen on his side, the legislator source said the President's allies were surprised to hear Aquino say he was open to it but knew it wasn't a real consideration since day one.,SECOND TERM? President Benigno Aquino III says in a television interview that he is open to a second term, but sources say it was all a strategy. Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau,\u201cEveryone in Congress believes it's not going to happen,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe know him as a person. He always talks about the number of days he has left. And we know he wants his last two years to be productive.\u201d,A more effective solution, said the legislator source, may lie in Aquino finding an alternative to Roxas. The source clarified many believe Roxas can do a good job as president in maintaining the reforms of this administration \u2013 the problem is his winnability.,But Aquino is also to blame, said the source.,Because the President has yet to anoint Roxas as his chosen one, \u201cRoxas has been unable to consolidate\u201d or \u201cgalvanize support.\u201d At the same time, Aquino's silence also helps Binay, who is spared of criticism from allies of the President as long as he himself hesitates to separate the Vice President from his administration.,\u201cWe can't criticize Binay because he's still part of the family. We're caught in the middle,\u201d the lawmaker pointed out. \u201c[The President] should make a decision.\u201d,Coalition cracks,The situation is also exacerbating cracks within the LP and within Malaca\u00f1ang.,At the moment, talks among congressmen of moving out of the Liberal Party or backing a different candidate are rife, but no actual transfers have taken place \u2013 at least not yet. At least two sources Rappler interviewed said they expect moves to start happening in the first half of 2015 \u2013 unless the LP finds a viable alternative to Roxas.,There are about 112 LP members in the lower chamber, out of 290 seats.,A similar dynamic is taking place inside the Palace. All continue to be loyal to the President, but it's no secret ,there are factions within Malaca\u00f1ang's walls,.,Since 2010, when Aquino first set foot in the Palace, he took with him the men who helped him during his campaign.,They were united in backing Aquino, but divided in their bets for vice president. The so-called Samar faction is linked to Binay, who ran with the opposition, while the Balay faction or the LP is identified with Roxas, Binay\u2019s 2010 rival for the vice presidency.,More than halfway through the President's term, the factions are even more pronounced now that 2016 nears.,When the controversy surrounding the administration\u2019s economic stimulus package, the DAP, first came out, some of the men closest to the President inside Malaca\u00f1ang were just as surprised as the Filipino public. ,Allegations of bribery and senators receiving millions of pesos of DAP funds, for projects not part of the General Appropriations Act also caught administration officials off-guard. They knew about DAP, but they did not know the details regarding DAP allotment to lawmakers.,One thing those left out of the loop had in common? They are not members of the Liberal Party.,Thorough discussions on DAP is one of many examples of how, in the President\u2019s inner circle, some groups or individuals bypass others when speaking to Aquino.,While they may be constantly sniping at each other, they continue to serve one master: Aquino. \u201cWorking behind [Aquino's] back? They won\u2019t cross that line. At least for now,\u201d the Palace source told Rappler. \u201cMaybe next year.\u201d,'Not the time',Abad said it is much too early to make any judgments on Roxas. \u201cI think it's premature to make conclusions of the viability of the candidate at this point,\u201d he said.,He speaks of \"two tracks\" moving forward. \u201cThe first one, which is important, is that the President's reform agenda must not just continue but intensify,\" Abad told Rappler.,\u201cThe other track is: to whom then is the torch going to be passed? That's an important track. Those who believe that they are both capable as well as committed to this reform thrust of the Aquino administration, they must begin to prepare themselves so that when that moment comes, when that opportunity opens, the door opens right before them, then they can have that moment and carry the torch.\u201d,FOCUS ON REFORMS. Liberty Party stalwarts believe focusing on reforms will be enough to sway votes for the President's chosen one in 2016. Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau,Because the party's focus is on making the reforms so convincing that the people would be scrambling to ask the President who he will appoint, Abad insisted \u201cnow is not the time\u201d to worry about 2016, but \u201cthe time to prepare.\u201d,Having been a congressman through 4 presidencies himself, Abad also brushed off concerns of their allies in Congress.,\u201cOf course they want to be with the winning candidate, but that\u2019s the nature of politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have 22 months until we vote. Politicians are ,seguristas,. But presidential elections are not determined by local politics. Presidential elections, unlike congressional and senatorial elections, are governed by issues of vision and persona.\u201d,Abad said Aquino would be \u201cintimately involved\u201d when the time to campaign for 2016 comes, since \u201che is the most identified with all this poverty reduction and economic agenda with a strong good governance platform.\u201d,He also expressed confidence that Binay\u2019s numbers will see a decline, especially once the President anoints his successor, and the Vice President gets distinctly separated from the administration.,So how does one solve a problem like Roxas? To some of the President's men, he apparently isn't the problem. ,\u2013, ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/68827-mar-roxas-viability-2016-elections", "title": "How do you solve a problem like Mar Roxas?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/122346-female-genital-mutilation,http://www.rappler.com/nation/63630-aquino-endorsement-poe-roxas,http://www.rappler.com/nation/44076-sc-junks-pork-barrel-unconstitutional"},

I have chosen to ignore this and focus on the job at hand. But the events of recent days indicate that this plot is now being set into motion. , ,From the very beginning, the President and I had major differences in principles and values.

{"content": "\nFor as long as economic activity is heavily concentrated in a few urban areas, no one can really blame the poor for wanting to leave their relocation sites in exchange for brighter prospects in the city centers\n,Society is governed by two types of laws: the laws enacted by governments and the laws of supply and demand.,This distinction can explain why people sometimes behave differently from the intended outcomes of policy.,Take for example the imposition of a minimum wage. While it is almost always intended to benefit poor workers, the minimum wage can result in a disincentive to hire among employers and, hence, higher unemployment especially among young and inexperienced workers. (See a ,previous article, on the Kasambahay Law.),Never-ending tension,The interaction between the laws of government and the laws of economics is also apparent in the seemingly never-ending tension between the government and informal settlers (\u201csquatters\u201d in colloquial terms).,For instance, in an effort to declog waterways in Metro Manila, the current administration (through the Department of Interior and Local Government or DILG) ,has started, a massive resettlement project to move around 60,000 informal settlers situated along major waterways like Pasig River, Tullahan River, and San Juan River.,Yet another project aims to relocate thousands of families situated near Agham Road in Quezon City\u2019s North Triangle area to give way to a new central business district.,Decades of experience suggest that such efforts, by themselves, will not be fully effective in permanently relocating the poor away from city centers. This is despite the presence of otherwise unattractive urban features like higher housing rents and natural hazard risks. Poor informal settlers just keep coming back to the city.,But why exactly?, ,Housing vs. commuting,For one thing, the desire to live and work in city centers can depend largely on the relative attractiveness of living in city centers versus subcenters.,Consider the plight of an informal settler family living in the middle of Quezon City and being offered cheap housing in a relocation site somewhere in ,Balagtas, Bulacan,. Let\u2019s assume for a moment that they refuse to give up their present employment or business in the city center.,On the one hand, housing does cost cheaper in Bulacan relative to Quezon City. That is, the price of housing per square meter goes down with each extra kilometer farther away from Quezon City and nearer Bulacan.,On the other hand, the total cost of commutes to and from the city center will become higher. In the absence of a light rail transit (like the proposed MRT-7 to run along Commonwealth Ave), the family\u2019s commute can take ,hours, via tricycles, jeeps, and buses. Imagine a poor family doing this costly commute 5 times a week.,Taken together, the farther the family is from Quezon City, housing prices go down while the total commute costs rise. For as long as an extra mile of commuting costs more than the extra decrease in housing prices, the poor informal settler family will choose to remain in the city center and refuse offers to live in the suburbs.,From this cost-benefit decision calculus, the way to induce the informal settler family to live outside of city center is straightforward: Increase the attractiveness of living far away by reducing the relative cost of commuting.,While a light rail transit can help in this regard, subsidizing commute costs for the poor (given high upfront infrastructure costs) will be hard to justify on a long-term perspective. (Even today, there is an ,effort to reduce, the high subsidies allocated to the MRT-3 running along EDSA.),Benefits of clustering,Another way to incentivize informal settlers to live in the suburbs is by making these places viable areas to live and work in. Hence, we obviate the need to reduce (or even subsidize) commute costs to and from the city centers.,This can be done by recreating in the suburbs what the poor are looking for in the city centers: The benefits and opportunities which arise from the ,clustering, of economic activity.,Indeed, great things arise when firms and establishments of similar or different trades locate near one another. Firms can reduce their costs by sourcing their materials from nearby suppliers; they can learn about emergent market trends and copy each other\u2019s production techniques; they can also benefit from the pooling of clients and attract more foot traffic than if they were separated and isolated.,On the other hand, workers also benefit from interactions with workers of other firms. In the event of job layoffs in one firm, searching for a new job will be less difficult since they can immediately find alternative employment in nearby establishments and rely on referrals by friends and colleagues nearby.,These and many other benefits (collectively known as \u201cagglomeration economies\u201d) explain the emergence of malls (e.g., SM City), new cities (e.g., Santa Rosa in Laguna), urbanized districts (e.g., Bonifacio Global City in Taguig), and economic zones (e.g., SBMA in Subic).,MASSIVE RESETTLEMENT. To declog waterways in Metro Manila, the Aquino administration starts a massive resettlement project to move around 60,000 informal settlers situated along major waterways. Photo from Shutterstock,Urban slums,Urban slums, too, can be thought of as communities arising from the benefits of agglomeration economies. A visit to one of the larger slum communities in the metro will show that these areas are not so much a homogeneous collection of residential units, but are in fact dynamic, thriving centers of business, too.,From wet and dry markets, bakeries, laundry shops, internet cafes, barbershops, parlors \u2014 name it, they\u2019ve got it. Businesses in these communities also locate themselves such that they\u2019re visible to people going to and fro schools, offices, and transit terminals \u2014 much like how mall establishments strategically locate where foot traffic is highest.,The clustering of economic activity results in benefits and opportunities which everyone, including the poor, will naturally seek to partake in. The fact that the poor are willing to overlook things like congested houses and natural hazard risks in slums suggests that residing in these areas must deliver immense benefits to their lives, enough to overcome the costs of these inconveniences.,In other words, for as long as there are agglomeration economies to be enjoyed in city centers, the incentive of living in urban areas will exert a powerful pull over the poor\u2019s decision where to live and work. Such pull can be powerful enough to overcome any piece of legislation or policy aiming to permanently relocate them to far-flung areas with little or no such agglomeration economies.,New business districts,Perhaps, then, a better way to look at the problem is not to simply relocate informal settlers hither and thither, but to ,integrate, them in the urban landscape by developing agglomeration economies in more and more areas outside of metropolitan areas.,In other words, there should be a concerted effort to promote the development of business districts with high growth potential and substantial job creation in areas around and outside metropolitan areas like Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Metro Davao.,To some extent this is already happening, what with the emergence of high-growth areas like Cavite, Laguna, and Batangas south of Metro Manila; Iloilo City in the Visayas; and Cagayan de Oro City in Mindanao.,However, there are currently not enough of these emerging business districts around the country to accommodate the millions of people still living in poverty. Bringing the benefits of economic clustering closer to the regions (and hence, the poor) would be a perfect way of promoting inclusive growth and alleviating regional inequalities.,Don\u2019t blame the poor,Given the powerful economic incentives of living in the cities, mandating the full and permanent resettlement of the urban poor to the hinterlands will be as futile as King Canute ordering the tides of the sea to retreat through law or decree.,For as long as economic activity is heavily concentrated in a few urban areas \u2014 that is, growth is geographically exclusive and not inclusive \u2014 no one can really blame the poor for wanting to leave their relocation sites in exchange for brighter prospects in the city centers. ,Until development is brought to these suburban areas, that is the poor\u2019s way of partaking in the fruits of economic growth. \u2013, Rappler.com,JC Punongbayan holds a master\u2019s degree in economics from the UP School of Economics.

But even with a presidential endorsement, 24% said they would not vote for Poe compared to a bigger percentage of 42% who said they would not vote for Roxas. About 3% of those surveyed said an endorsement from Aquino would have no effect on their choice of Poe, while 4% said it would have no effect on their choice of Roxas.,Roxas, a trusted ally of Aquino, is being eyed as the ,Liberal Party's presidential candidate, so that reforms initiated by the administration would have continuity, party officials have said. They had pinned their hopes on the strength of an Aquino endorsement premised on the President's high approval ratings.,Pulse Asia conducted a survey from June 24-July 2, 2014 on first choice presidential preference, given a presidential endorsement.,(Click on the circles below and hover over the shaded portions of the wheel to see actual numbers),Binay still far ahead,The same survey also showed Vice President Jejomar Binay still solidly ahead of possible contenders in the 2016 presidential race.

She has managed to ,pass one major bill, at the Senate, the Freedom of Information bill.,She has two other bills awaiting the President\u2019s signature \u2013 Strengthening the Dangerous Drugs Act, and the Free Mobile Disasters Alert Act.,Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada was a distant third choice with 9%; he was not listed in the previous survey.

Senator Antonio Trillanes IV presents documents that supposedly prove President Rodrigo Duterte had over P2 billion in his bank accounts, during a news briefing on February 16, 2017. Photo by Joseph Vidal/PRIB  ,MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) \u2013 It was a throwback of sorts on Thursday, February 16, as Senator Antonio Trillanes IV revived his challenge to President Rodrigo Duterte to \"prove him wrong\" that he had as much as P2.4 billion in his bank accounts not declared in his Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth when he was mayor.,\"Ilabas mo ang tapang mo dito. Ipakita mo na mali ako, (Show how brave you are now. Prove me wrong),\" Trillanes said in a news briefing where he distributed copies of documents he obtained from concerned citizen \"Joseph de Mesa,\" after validating their authenticity.,Trillanes, among Duterte's staunchest critics, alleged that the President had accumulated P2.4 billion in several Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) accounts, one at the branch in Julia Vargas in Ortigas, Pasig City.,It's the ,same allegation, he made during the 2016 campaign period when the senator, running as an independent vice presidential candidate, accused Duterte of corruption during his stint as Davao City mayor. ,This time, however, Trillanes provided to media the supposed transaction records of bank accounts owned by Duterte, his 3 adult children, and his common-law wife, Honeylet Avance\u00f1a, from 2006 to 2015.,Trillanes said he was reviving the issue of Duterte's bank accounts supposedly because his questions remain unanswered. The senator, whose term ends in 2019, said he is willing to step down from his post if his allegations turn out to be a dud. ,\"Sinabi niya na papatunayan niya. Wala naman, 9 months na. So, Mr President, panahon na [na sagutin ito] at mamaya't-mayain kita. Hindi ko bibitiwan ang isyu na ito,\", Trillanes said.,(He said he would prove me wrong. But nothing has happened and it's been 9 months already. So, Mr President, it's time [to answer this] because I won't stop reminding you. I won't let go of this issue.),The bank accounts listed under Duterte are mostly accounts owned alongside his children, two of whom are also elected officials in Davao City \u2013 Sara is the mayor while Paolo is the vice mayor. ,Trillanes said the money that went into Duterte's accounts \u2013 a mix of inter-account bank transfers, purchases of insurance policies, credit memos, and deposits \u2013 were not just from campaign contributions, and allegedly \"showed a pattern of behavior\" of corruption.,He said among the notable transactions were those involving Davao City businessman ,Sammy Uy,, the President's friend and campaign contributor, who reportedly gave a total of  P120 million to members of the Duterte family.,'Time to unmask',The senator said aside from getting the documents, he felt it was time to revive his challenge to Duterte as the noise of the campaign had died down. He also reiterated his vow to resign from the Senate if he would be proven wrong.,\"It's time to unmask this guy,\" he said, referring to the President.,He said his objective in reviving the allegation was to \"inform the public,\" especially those who supported Duterte on the strength of his campaign promises.,\"Maraming naloko. Noong kampanya, hindi napakinggan ito....Ngayon nakikita na ang kalidad nitong Pangulo natin. Mas bukas na ang kanilang pag-iisip, (Many were fooled. This was drowned out by the campaign noise... Now, they can better see the quality of our President. Their minds are more open now),\" he said.,Asked about the simple lifestyle shown by the President, including his ,humble home, in Davao City, Trillanes reiterated his earlier claim that Duterte owned other properties. (READ: ,Rodrigo Duterte's 386 P. Guevarra property,),Trillanes filed a ,plunder complaint, against Duterte days before the May 2016 elections, for allegedly having ghost employees at the Davao City Hall under his watch.,'Political noise',Malaca\u00f1ang and administration alllies dismissed the allegations as \"political noise.\",Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said in a news briefing on Thursday that Duterte would respond to the allegation \"if necessary and if within the right context... but not just to respond to some grandstanding.\",\"It's a rehash of items that have been already discussed 3 days before elections. So basically, he's just bringing up old issues. Now, if he truly has something in mind then he probably should just go through the proper authorities in order to be able to lay down something like this. It's best to do it according to due process,\" Abella said.,He said in another media interview that Duterte \"faces humongous challenges in nation-building and he has better things to do with his time than to be explaining something that had already been gone through in the past.\",\"We have a political landscape where people tend to make this kind of noise. The President is not focused on these things. He's not trying to defend himself; the President is more focused on nation-building,\" Abella added.,As far as Malaca\u00f1ang is concerned, Duterte had already \"addressed\" the allegation.,\"This should be properly addressed at the proper venue. If he thinks he has something else, he should raise it to the proper authorities. As far as the Palace is concerned, it has already addressed this\u2026.I think there should be a more civilized way of handling these things rather than grandstanding, don't you think?\" Abella said.,Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, Duterte's vice presidential candidate during the 2016 elections, dismissed Trillanes' move as a \"desperate attempt to stop the reforms\" of the current administration.,Cayetano, who like Trillanes is a member of the Nacionalista Party, said in an interview with reporters after Trillanes' press briefing that his party mate's patrons might have been adversely affected by these reforms.,\"He should have come out with this before June 30 because [Duterte] did not have immunity [from suit] then,\" he added. \u2013 ,with a report from Pia Ranada / Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/161633-trillanes-revives-duterte-bank-accounts", "title": "Trillanes on Duterte bank accounts: 'Prove me wrong'", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/164407-duterte-impeachment-complaint-fight-for-all-filipinos-alejano,http://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/corona-trial/1089-full-interview-with-lawyer-jose-manuel-diokno-on-pre-trial-and-nature-of-proceedings,http://www.rappler.com/nation/162763-senate-summons-lascanas-davao-death-squad-probe,http://www.rappler.com/nation/146927-medialdea-issues-memo-duterte-spokesmen,http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/131166-trillanes-duterte-sign-bank-waiver,http://www.rappler.com/%20http:/www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/156159-rodrigo-duterte-shinzo-abe-summit-samuel-uy"},

Whether a Roxas-Poe is feasible is anyone's guess.    ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 In the end, the 2016 presidential race will be reduced to a one-on-one fight between the ruling Liberal Party\u2019s (LP) presumptive bet Mar Roxas and Vice President Jejomar Binay.,That\u2019s the fearless forecast of LP political affairs adviser and Caloocan Representative Edgar Erice, even as survey figures show otherwise.,But Erice who spoke to Rappler on Monday, April 20, said he is confident that Roxas, who\u2019s lagging behind in presidential preference surveys, will be able to catch up.,One perfect example is Binay himself, who surged in the surveys later in the campaign during the 2010 national race.,\u201cMy wild guess\u2026it will be a one-on-one,\u201d Erice said, referring to Roxas and Binay. As to other prospective presidential candidates, Erice casually dismissed them. \u201cThe Third Force will always land third.\u201d,Latest ,Pulse Asia survey, results released last March showed Binay holding sway with 29 percentage points despite being dragged into several corruption issues, with neophyte senator Grace Poe getting 14 percentage points, but holding on to second place in presidential preference.,Manila Mayor and former president Joseph Estrada and Davao Mayor Rodrigo \u201cRody\u201d Duterte are locked in third place with 12 percentage points each.,Roxas, the current Local Government Secretary, is in 6th place with only 4 percentage points, 2 points lower compared to a survey conducted in 2014.  ,But to Erice, \u201cthey survey is the least of our problem.\u201d He cited the case of Binay \u201cwho was only 2 points\u201d at the early start of the campaign in 2010.,Erice said Roxas\u2019 numbers are expected to rise once President Aquino anoints him as his preferred successor in 2016. The President, he assured, will be active in campaigning for Roxas. \u201cHe will do whatever he can that the successor will come from LP.\u201d,Erice also said the LP, \u201cwhich is the strongest party in terms of machinery\u201d will be fully behind Roxas.,He said Roxas will resign from the cabinet the moment Aquino anoints him his successor. ,Aquino's satisfaction ratings, have declined however as a result of the Mamasapano bloodbath. The latest net satisfaction rating of the Aquino administration dropped to an ,all-time low, to 19 percent.,Favored VP partner,Analyzing the political configuration, Erice sees a tandem forming between Roxas and Poe as a natural progression.,\u201cIt is the writing on the wall, Mar and Grace,\u201d Erice said, in reference to a Biblical narrative of Daniel interpreting the handwriting on the wall while Babylonian King Belshazzar was hosting a feast. Daniel predicted the downfall of the Babylonian king. ,Poe has played coy about her political intentions for 2016. Supported by both the LP and the opposition United Nationalist Alliance, Poe topped the senatorial race in the midterm 2013 polls.,On Tuesday, April 21, however, ,Poe, pointed out she has not received any direct offers from either Roxas or the LP.,In a text message, she said, \u201cThere has been no formal offer from them,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to interpret feelers that are not direct to the point. I cannot comment on the possibilities because Sec Mar himself has not publicly declared his intentions.\u201d,Her high numbers in surveys have made her the number one choice of political strategists and tacticians as running mate of their presidential wannabe clients. In an earlier podcast interview, ,Angelito Banayo,, who works for Duterte, said Poe is the perfect running mate. ,Will Poe follow the footsteps of broadcaster Noli de Castro, who topped the senatorial race in 2001 and who went on to win the vice presidency in 2004?,Several sources have said Poe has supposedly committed to support the vice presidential bid of Senator Francis Escudero, who placed fourth in the 2013 senatorial race. In 2010, Escudero set his eyes on the presidency, only to back out following a rift with his former party, the Nationalist People\u2019s Coalition.,The sources said Poe wants to repay Escudero for helping her in her 2013 senatorial campaign, which she topped.,Erice said the LP has started courting Poe as Roxas\u2019 running mate. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/90659-roxas-poe-tandem-liberal-party-erice", "title": "Roxas-Poe tandem inevitable \u2013 LP's Erice", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/68370-star-magic-ball-2014-best-dressed-gowns-red-carpet,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits"},

{"content": "\n(4th UPDATE) Voting unanimously, 14 justices decide against the pork barrel system\n,ACTING ON PORK. The Supreme Court says the pork barrel of lawmakers is unconstitutional. File photo by Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines (8th UPDATE) \u2013 The Supreme Court on Tuesday, November 19, declared as unconstitutional the legislators' controversial pork barrel fund known as the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF).,The High Tribunal also struck down as illegal provisions in two laws that allow the President to use the Malampaya Fund and the President's Social Fund for purposes beyond the mandate of the funds.,The vote against the PDAF was 14-0, according to Supreme Court spokesman Theodore Te. Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco Jr inhibited from the case because his son is a congressman. The ponente, or writer of the decision, is Associate Justice Estela Bernabe, an appointee of President Benigno Aquino III.,The verdict reads:,\u201cIn view of the constitutional violations discussed in this Decision, the Court hereby declares as UNCONSTITUTIONAL: (,a,) the entire 2013 PDAF Article; (,b,) all legal provisions of past and present Congressional Pork Barrel Laws, such as the previous PDAF and CDF Articles and the various Congressional Insertions, which authorize/d legislators\u2014whether individually or collectively organized into committees---to intervene, assume or participate in any of the various post-enactment stages of the budget execution, such as but not limited to the areas of project identification, modification and revision of project identification, fund release and/or fund realignment, unrelated to the power of congressional oversight; (,c,)  all legal provisions of past and present Congressional Pork Barrel laws, such as the previous PDAF and CDF Articles and the various Congressional Insertions, which confer/red personal, lump-sum allocations to legislators from which they are able to fund specific projects which they themselves determine; (,d,) all informal practices of similar import and effect, which the Court similarly deems to be acts of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of discretion; and (,e,) the phrases (1) \u201cand for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President\u201d under Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 910 and (2) \u201cto finance the priority infrastructure development projects\u201d under Section 12 of PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993, for both failing the sufficient standard test in violation of the principle of non-delegability of legislative power.\",Malampaya and President's pork,In its decision, the Court stopped the release of money from the Malampaya fund that is not for energy projects and activities. It struck as illegal the phrase \"and for such other purposes as may hereafter be directed by the President,\" which is stated in Presidential Decree 910, or the law that is the basis of government's use of revenues from national resources such as gas. ,The justices also disallowed the release of parts of the President's Social Fund that are used \"to finance...priority infrastructure development projects,\" as stated in Presidential Decree 1869.,Critics have said these phrases are discretionary in nature. (,READ: The pork barrel trail,),The Court said they were striking down these portions of the two laws \"for failing the self-sufficient standard test in violation of the principle of non-delegability of legislative power.\",The Court also ordered all prosecutors to investigate and prosecute all government officials and private individuals \"for possible criminal offenses related to the irregular, improper and/or unlawful disbursement/utilization of funds under the Pork Barrel System.\",Remaining 2013 PDAF to be returned to Treasury,With the SC decision, the temporary restraining order on the PDAF imposed on September 10, 2013 has been declared permanent. ,The remaining 2013 PDAF allocations yet to be released to lawmakers, as well as portions of the PSF and Malampaya Funds declared unconstitutional, will be returned to the government's coffers,Ahead of the SC decision, both chambers of Congress waived their right to their frozen PDAF for 2013 and authorized the President to use it as a calamity fund.,In an ambush interview shortly after the decision was announced, Budget Secretary Butch Abad said he has yet to read the SC decision as of posting time but the government is studying how the funds will be used. ,Meanwhile, the SC denied the petitioners' request for the budget department to provide a detailed list of how the PDAF, the Malampaya and PSF Fund was utilized and availed since the public already has access to the documents. ,Below are the parts of the decision, as read by Atty Te in a press briefing Tuesday:,Following public uproar over the multibillion pork barrel scam, petitioners went to the High Court to question the legal basis that allowed lawmakers to participate in the execution of projects even after the budget is passed.,Earlier, Justice Carpio called the PDAF \",illegal on its face,\" and \"riddled with unconstitutionality.\" ,He said the 2013 General Appropriations Act (GAA) violated the Constitution when it gave Cabinet Secretaries the President\u2019s power to realign savings and required the concurrence of both chambers of Congress to realign and release funds.,In the past, the High Court upheld the system's constitutionality. But the PDAF in the 2013 national budget was \"a different animal,\" Carpio earlier said, because it made the identification of a lawmaker's project \"mandatory\" rather than \"recommendatory.\",The pork barrel scam involving the ,alleged misuse of at least P6 billion worth of lawmakers' discretionary funds, sparked massive protests to abolish the system. The woman at the center of the scam, Janet Lim Napoles, is detained over serious illegal detention charges and also faces a plunder complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman.,In its decision, the high court also ordered the investigation of government officials who may have misused the funds. ,Earlier, the House of Representatives decided to scrap the PDAF from the proposed 2014 GAA and realign its P25.2 billion allocation to 6 executive agencies.,Most senators, meanwhile, are leaning towards completely deleting their PDAF allocation for 2014 from the budget., - ,with reports from Angela Casauay/Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/44076-sc-junks-pork-barrel-unconstitutional", "title": "SC junks PDAF as unconstitutional", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/122115-arrest-warrant-neri-naig-miranda-danilyn-nunga-libel,http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/152589-hottest-gay-guy-braves-hiv-test,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/148528-wynwyn-marquez-mark-anthony-fernandez-mark-herras-uncle-death,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/nation/38699-napoles-scheme-pdaf-infographic,http://www.rappler.com/nation/40890-pdaf-oral-arguments-original-sin"},

Yet Poe said she did not force Aquino to give her a specific offer because she was also not yet ready to decide.,The senator, who is faring well in surveys, said her meeting with Aquino lacked specifics, but there was a particular question she boldly asked.,\u201c,'Mr President, kung saka-sakali, 'di naman po ako Liberal, susuportahan ba ninyo ako?' Sabi naman niya gusto niyang magkaroon ng konsultasyon sa grupo nila para kahit hindi Liberal, pero ang prinsipyong 'sinusulong niya para sa reporma ang may kakayanan ang taong gawin iyon ay gusto niyang suportahan.\u201d,(\"Mr President, if ever [I decide to run], I am not a member of the Liberal Party, will you support me?\" He said he wants to consult his group, but even if it's not a Liberal Party member, the person who can push for the principle and the reforms they are fighting for, he would support.),Poe said that Aquino responded with a commitment. \u201cAt least from a personal level, but of course, the President has to consult his party for approval. He said he would like to make that commitment.\u201d,The President announced on a trip to Canada last Friday that he talked to Poe about the 2016 polls, but refused to say what \u201ccommitment\u201d he gave her.,Aquino is the chairman of the ruling Liberal Party (LP). The party president on leave, Roxas reportedly wants to be the LP's standard-bearer but has been ,trailing behind Poe and front runner Vice President Jejomar Binay in opinion polls,. Poe is an independent candidate allied with the administration, and ran with the LP's Senate slate in 2013. ,Some LP members are ,pushing for a Roxas-Poe tandem, but others believe that with Poe's popularity, she will be better off as a presidential bet.,A reluctant possible candidate, Poe said the meeting with the President will help her decide on her political plans.,\u201c,It is a huge honor to have the trust of someone you respect. If ever, I won't say I have a bigger chance now but, of course, that adds to the decision I will make. But I can't say I am already sure because this is just one aspect.\u201d,Poe said much of her meeting with Aquino was \u201creading between the lines.\u201d She said he did not even directly ask her if she was open to higher office.,\u201c,This is what is clear. Aren't people asking if he is thinking about 2016? It's clear that he is. Second, it's clear that the President is thinking of someone they can support who has the trust of the people, and has the chance to push for their reforms. On a practical matter...oh never mind, that's it.\u201d,Poe said Aquino is looking for an \u201calternative.\u201d,\u201c,Siguro 'yun ang alternative na sinasabi, na mayroon na ang administrasyon kung sakali, pero ito ay pinag-iisipang mabuti. Karangalan na matawag ng 'ginagalang natin na mamuno sa atin. Pero 'di nangangahulugan noon bigla kang lulukso at sasama diyan.\u201d,(Maybe that is the alternative that he is saying: that the administration also needs an alternative if ever, but I have to think that through. It's an honor to be considered, but it doesn't mean I will immediately jump and join the bandwagon.),'Principled allies',What will make Poe decide to run for office?,The senator said she first has to study, and consult her mother, actress Susan Roces.,\u201c,Importante rin sa lahat, buo ang loob mo. 'Di lang sa tingin mo kaya mo, mananalo ka, kundi paano ka ba talaga makakatulong? At ang pinakamalaking problema natin ang mahihirap. Paano natin maiangat iyon? 'Di lang reporma laban sa korapsyon, pero ang pagtulong talaga. Kaya ko ba? Sa ano ba'ng posisyon? Pinag-iisipan ko pa,,\u201d she said.,(The most important is a firm resolve. It's not just about thinking if you can do it and win, but thinking how you can help, and our biggest problem is poverty. How do we uplift the poor? It's not just about anti-corruption reforms but really helping. Can I do it? In what position, I am still thinking it through.),Poe admitted that she is inexperienced, being a senator for only two years after heading the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board. In an apparent reference to Binay, she said her edge is her clean record in government.,\u201c,There are many who have been in government for a longer time, so it's not easy to decide. But I believe that despite shortcomings and things left to be done, the reform on corruption must be continued,\u201d Poe said.,Poe also addressed concerns about her perceived rift with Aquino after she issued a scathing report holding the President ultimately responsible for the January 25 Mamasapano clash. The biggest crisis to hit Aquino's administration, the clash in Maguindanao killed 67, and put the peace process in peril.,She has also criticized Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya over the poor Metro Trail Transit (MRT) services, and resigned police chief Alan Purisima over corruption. Abaya and Purisima are friends of Aquino.,Still, the senator said she and Aquino are \u201cprincipled allies.\u201d,\u201c,The mere fact he called me there means he appreciates my work. He knows I am an ally, a principled ally. My priority is what's best for the country. I also appreciate what he has done. There may be some deficiencies in any particular system, but we're here to help make it better,\u201d Poe said.,Drilon: Mar still LP bet,Poe said she talked to her close friend, Senator Francis Escudero, about the meeting with Aquino. Escudero is rumored to be running for vice president, and a possible running mate of Poe should she seek the presidency as an independent bet. ,\u201c,We're supportive of each other. We don't want to compete against each other. Senator Chiz is also independent so whatever his plan is, it's not tied to a particular party. I think [the LP] is also considering him,\u201d she said.,LP vice chairman Senator Franklin Drilon though maintained that ,Roxas is still the \u201cpresumptive candidate\" of the administration,. It was Drilon who first revealed that Roxas supposedly said he wants to run for president.,\u201c,But, of course, we have to seek the opinion of the highest official of the land, and our chairman,\u201d said Drilon.,Despite his high post in the LP, Drilon said he was not \u201ctotally aware\u201d of the Poe meeting. \u201cI don't think the President should ask anyone's permission.\u201d ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/92868-poe-aquino-support-2016", "title": "Poe asked Aquino: Will you support me?", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151371-jodi-sta-maria-drugs-alcohol-after-annulment-pampi-lacson,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/146000-sneak-peek-fifty-shades-darker-christian-greys-perspective,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156674-duterte-christmas-eve-photos"},

Trillanes was among the senators who led the more than yearlong investigation.,\",Noong una, ang tapang mo, very transparent ka sinasabi mong\u2026marami kang pinatay at kung ano-ano pa pero dito natanggal ang tapang mo at nagtatago ka ngayon sa mga technalities, Pirmahan mo na ang waiver para magkaalaman na,,\" he added.,(At first, you were so brave, and very transparet in admitting you killed so many, among other things. But now, you've lost your courage and you're hinding behind technicalities. Sign the waiver so that the truth would be revealed.),The BPI account, Trillanes had earlier alleged, is not declared in Duterte's Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN), an impeachable offense if he is elected president.,Trillanes identified and listed at least 9 transactions involving the mayor's alleged joint account with his daughter, former Davao City mayor Sara Z. Duterte.,No affidavit,The senator made the statement as he rejected the demand of the Duterte camp to execute an affidavit detailing his allegations against the mayor before the latter signs a waiver to allow scrutiny of his Bank of the Philippine Islands branch in Ortigas.,He dismissed this as the camp's tactic to \"buy time\" until the May 9 polls and to track down the source of his information, whom he had promised to protect.,Trillanes said once proven wrong, he would not only pull out of the vice presidential race but would also \"immediately resign\" from the Senate where his term ends in 2019.,\"Pagka nakita natin na mali ang akusasyon ko na P2.4 billion na transactions sa account  niya, magreresign ako ora mismo sa Senado, mag-pu-pullout na ako sa VP race, wala na ako sa politika, they can sue me whatever, nandiyan, saksing buhay si Ted at ang mga nakikinig sa atin,,\" he said.,(If my allegations \u2013 that there were P2.4 billion in transactions in his account \u2013 are wrong, I will immediately resign from the Senate, I will pull out of the VP race.

Why not follow the law?\u2026Let us put the imprimatur of law,\" she said.,Alvarez reiterated that the alleged P200-million BPI account did not exist.,To this, the senator replied: ',Wag tayong paandaran sa ganyang mga legal obstacle, mga techicalities.

VP Binay already did that and it didn't work\u2026.That's just misdirection.),Alvarez countered that the demand for an affidavit is meant to ensure that the senator can be held liable if proven that he lied under oath. \"There is no Senate investigation now, no prosecution; only persecution.  You are going after our head by using unverified information,\" she added.,Trillanes replied that he can he sued for libel, and even for violation of the bank secrecy law, even without executing an affidavit.,Where's Duterte transparency pledge?,The senator also recalled the ,manifesto, signed by Duterte and his running mate, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, in March, allowing their bank accounts to be scrutinized by the public.,The manifesto, printed on a piece of cardboard, declared that the presidential and vice-presidential candidates who sign it \"pledge to open all our bank accounts in local and foreign currencies both here and abroad in the interest of transparency and accountability.\",Asked about this, Alvarez said this was just a \"general waiver\" that cannot be used for the BPI account. She reiterated that the Duterte camp is ready to execute a specific waiver once Trillanes complies with the affidavit challenge.,Trillanes claimed this only proved that the March manifesto was \"all for show, has no use, and only for propaganda.\" He said Duterte as gung-ho for transparency in this regard in March, but not anymore.,\",Palaging ganyan si Mayor Duterte puro propaganda. 'Pag naipit mo, kakambiyo. Ilang beses na po 'yan. Itong sinasabi ni Atty Alvarez, hindi tayo abogado pero hindi rin tayo tanga,,\" he said.,(Mayor Duterte is always like that, all propaganda.

Photo by Leanne Jazul/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 What is the crux of objections to the pork barrel? What ultimately led to the abuse of the system?,To petitioners questioning the system\u2019s legality, giving lawmakers the power to interfere in the execution of projects after the passage of the budget is what they call the \u201coriginal sin.\u201d,During Supreme Court oral arguments, counsel for the petitioners Alfredo Molo III said this \u201csin\u201d violated fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution. ,(READ: ,'PDAF, Malampaya illegal on its face' \u2013  Carpio,),The Court is tackling 3 petitions questioning the constitutionality of the pork barrel or Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), and the so-called presidential pork or the use of the Malampaya fund for purposes other than energy development, and the President\u2019s Social Fund (PSF). (READ: ,SC stops release of PDAF, Malampaya fund,),\u201cThe pork barrel destroys checks and balances. The original sin is giving legislators direct interest in the smooth [passage] of the budget,\u201d Molo said in the proceedings on Tuesday, October 8.,\u201cLawmakers are playing an active role in the PDAF. It\u2019s not their job to assist the executive agencies [in the execution of the project]. They\u2019re not allowed to execute. They are participating after the law has come into effect.\u201d,Molo said that aside from checks and balances, the pork barrel system also violates the principle of separation of powers of the different branches of government.,\u201cThe PDAF allows legislators post-enactment [of the budget] to execute projects. It crosses the line between the executive and the legislative [branches].,\u201cThese are not just recommendations that lawmakers do. The [budget department] circular affirms that the department cannot substitute the preference of a legislator. The implementing agencies themselves say they never identify the projects.\u201d,Molo said that any act of a lawmaker in relation to the project after the passage of the budget is unconstitutional.,Evolution of the pork ,Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno showed the evolution of the pork barrel and repeatedly asked Molo if practices added to the system were unconstitutional. Molo said yes if the act was done after the budget\u2019s passage.,Raymond Fortun, counsel for petitioner Jose Villegas Jr, said the question was how the executive power was being implemented.,\u201c,Ang executive ang dapat mag-implement. What\u2019s happening is you have Congress coming back, putting its dirty hands sa proyekto na sila mismo nag-propose. Nakikialam sila eh dapat ang power to implement nasa local officials,\u201d ,Fortun said in an interview.,(The executive should implement the project, but Congress comes back, puts its dirty hands in the project that they themselves proposed. They are interfering even if it\u2019s the local officials who have the power to implement.),Only the petitioners were able to present their arguments on Tuesday.

The respondents will argue for the constitutionality of the pork barrel on Thursday, October 10. Photo by Leanne Jazul/Rappler ,\u2018Complete breakdown of controls\u2019,The justices asked the petitioners whether or not the abuse of the pork barrel system as seen in the pork barrel scam can already be addressed by the executive and legislative branches.,In the pork barrel scam, lawmakers allegedly endorsed their development funds to fake non-governmental organizations in exchange for kickbacks as big as 50% of the ghost project. The Aquino administration said it can address the problem by changing the current pork barrel system to include more safeguards.,\u201cWe are sensitive to the fact that we are not politicians. There are political solutions. We have to know whether it\u2019s time to step in,\u201d Sereno said.,The Chief Justice told Molo, \u201cIf you want us to fill in the problem because [there is] systems failure, you must give us the constitutional basis to step forward.\u201d,Before the start of the proceedings, Solicitor General Francis Jardeleza told reporters that the government maintains that the problem requires a \u201cpolitical solution.\u201d,\u201cThe Congress as the political branch is given the first crack at having reforms and they are listening to the people. The reforms are in the GAA, [the budget passed on second reading in the House] does not contain PDAF anymore,\u201d Jardeleza said.,Laywer Eduardo Bringas from the petitioners\u2019 side disagreed.,\u201cReforms of the legislative do not deter the commission of anomalies. That\u2019s the reason we have the COA (Commission on Audit) report,\u201d said Bringa. ,Fortun agreed that the system was already a failure, and reforms will not be enough.,\u201cThe executive and legislative say we will make the policies to avoid anomalies. The problem is they both hold the funds so how can we trust them? Ever since the CDF (Countrywide Development Fund), we gave them the chance to correct themselves. We gave them 13 years to change the PDAF system. They put the safeguards. Now what happened to those safeguards? We simply cannot allow these people to continue making changes for us. We have to go to the SC,\u201d Fortun told reporters.,The CDF was the former name of the PDAF, and was also tainted with scandal in 1996. ,COA Chairperson Grace Pulido Tan, appearing as a resource person, said the scam was not just a systems failure. ,\u201cWe\u2019re saying this is not just systems failure but a complete breakdown of controls. If you look at the legal framework, there are a lot of laws, regulations, but somehow in the enforcement, the way the system itself was designed, the controls failed.\" ,PEOPLE'S SAVIORS?

Photo by Leanne Jazul/Rappler ,Who\u2019s the savior?,While criticizing the \u201coriginal sin\u201d in the PDAF system, petitioners like defeated senatorial bet Samson Alcantara said only the High Court can be the \u201csavior.\u201d,\u201cFilipino people are losing confidence in the political branches of government. Their only hope now is with this honorable court. To restore people\u2019s trust and faith in their public officials, do away with political patronage and ensure expenditure of public funds only for public purposes. This honorable court will not just be regarded as reformer but a savior of this country,\u201d Alcantara said.,Associate Justice Marvic Leonen though questioned the argument. Like Sereno, he told the petitioners to expound in writing why the court must step in.,\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfair that the only burden in correcting the system is with the court? Shouldn't we say it's also with the legislature and executive and we will do our part in correcting it?\u201d ,\u201cThe presentation in your pleadings is it seems we are saviors but the truth is the Filipino people [working with the government] are the saviors.\u201d,On Tuesday, ,former Chief Justice Reynato Puno urged anti-pork barrel advocates to use the people's initiative mechanism, to propose a law to scrap all forms of discretionary funds. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/40890-pdaf-oral-arguments-original-sin", "title": "SC saviors and pork barrel's 'original sin'", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/160152-uncut-fifty-shades-darker-mtrcb-rating,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157579-arci-munoz-breakup-boyfriend-badi-del-rosario,http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/133877-two-pronged-ofw-husband-wife,http://www.rappler.com/nation/139042-robredo-federalism-questions,http://www.rappler.com/nation/40865-oral-arguments-pdaf-malampaya-illegal,http://www.rappler.com/nation/38558-sc-stops-release-pork-barrel"},

At the time, lawmakers had total discretion over where and how their pork barrel would be allocated.,The public outrage that resulted from this system led to reforms involving the use of congressional allocations of lawmakers were used.

WFP's Praveen Agrawal and Ericsson's Ellie Hanna, Rima Qureshi, and Brent Carbno discuss the importance of providing technical assistance during disasters.Photo by Sheila Rada,GUIUAN, Eastern Samar - In Guiuan, where Yolanda first made landfall, there is no electricity, water is distributed everyday through water tanks, and many people are living in tent cities which serve as temporary shelters \u2013 but there is WiFi.,Though intermittent and sometimes slow during a weather disturbance, there is WiFi connectivity that allows the various humanitarian organizations on the ground to coordinate with one another, report back to their Manila headquarters, and send vital status updates that help in avoiding replication and duplication of efforts and maximize resources.  ,It is Michael Hanrahan\u2019s job \u2013 a telecoms engineer and volunteer from the Ericsson Response Team - to make sure that the WiFi connection is working smoothly, to trouble shoot the usual technical problems, and set up new connections like the Internet connection in the field hospital set up in Guiuan by international medical organization, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF).,Hanrahan is one of the 150 full-time Ericsson employees around the world who have volunteered to be on a rapid deployment list where they could be activated at any time to set up communications in emergency situations.,\u201cWe saw the warnings about the typhoon (coming to the Philippines) and we were on standby to come here. Within a day after the typhoon hit, we got the call for the need for telecom assistance and got ready to make our way to Tacloban,\u201d said Hanrahan.,Tech response during disaster,When disaster strikes, the usual first response is to provide food, shelter, and financial aid. But when power and communication lines are destroyed and the connection to the outside world is lost \u2013 as was the case with Typhoon Yolanda - the need for technical response is vital.,Connectivity facilitates decision-making in a timely manner through the movement of data.,According to Praveen Agrawal, Country Director of The World Food Programme (WFP) Philippines, \u201cThe right decisions at the right time will save lives.\u201d,The Ericsson Response Team is partnered with several organizations within the United Nations, most importantly the WFP who heads the Emergency Telecom Cluster (ETC). It is partnerships like this that allow for immediate response during disasters.,On November 9, the day after Yolanda hit the Visayas, Agrawal was on the ,first C130 flight to Tacloban, to get response operations underway. Within the first 48 hours, a team was on the ground with emergency telecoms equipment, and the WiFi system was up and running during the first week. ,\u201cIt is our job to provide telecom expertise \u2013 everything from fully functioning mobile connection to a localized WiFi network so all NGOs coming through can connect with one another,\u201d said Hanrahan.,For Yolanda, Ericsson Emergency Response deployed a WiFi system called WIDER: Wireless LAN in Disaster and Emergency Response that provided Internet connectivity in Roxas City, Guiuan, and Tacloban for humanitarian workers in the area. The system provides wireless hotspots, telecommunications, and Internet connectivity between different relief agencies at disaster sites.,\u201cCommunication makes a huge difference out in the field. Ericsson provides our telecoms expertise to set up communications systems to serve and assist the relief community in their efforts,\u201d said Hanrahan.,Currently, there are about 15 Ericsson volunteers working in Yolanda-affected areas to assist the communication needs of about 6,000 registered users.,Employee Initiative,Ericsson Response Team started out as an employee initiative in 2000. An employee expressed interested in doing humanitarian work and using technical knowledge to help those in need. It was a suggestion that was welcomed by Ericsson who turned it into a global program whose objective is to work with humanitarian organizations to fulfill a basic human need of communication, a need that becomes more pronounced in the advent of a disaster. ,Volunteers are full-time Ericsson employees who have been trained by the UN, WFP, and other humanitarian agencies to understand the needs of the humanitarian community on the ground and how to best provide solutions. They are also oriented on the possible challenges during the mission.,\u201cWe could easily provide financial assistance. We could provide food, clothing, medication but we believe we can make much more of a difference by providing our technical expertise. So the way we do that is by working with established processes, established organizations such as the UN so they can do their job better,\u201d said Rima Qureshi, Global Senior Vice President for Special Projects and Head of Ericsson Response Team.  ,Private and public partnership,The collaboration between Ericsson and WFP, which began in 2002, highlights the importance of strategic partnerships between private sector and public sector, and how bringing the right kind of knowledge and expertise can save lives.,Agrawal stressed the importance of forging such kind partnerships because it enables them to have immediate access to highly specialized technical people and state of the art equipment that the UN or its agencies may not necessarily have access to.,The emergency communications response provided by Ericsson has been on-going for two months now. A 4th team is scheduled to arrive and continue operations on the ground.,Ericsson will stay as long as the ETC cluster requires their services or until local telecom providers fully resume their operations. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/response/49627-importance-technical-response-disasters", "title": "Importance of tech response during disasters", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/124642-maria-ozawa-denies-one-night-stand-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/sports/22242-lookback-growing-pains-for-promising-up-crew,http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/150044-star-magic-ball-2016-kim-chiu-xian-lim-kimxi,http://www.rappler.com/nation/43277-un-government-communications-yolanda"},

File photo by Jansen Romero/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 He admitted to letting his emotions get the best of him and being \u201cdismayed at himself,\u201d but Liberal Party (LP) standard-bearer Manuel Roxas did not apologize for what he sees as a fight against \u201cbullies\u201d who are used to always getting their way.,In an interview with reporters on Tuesday, December 15, at the LP headquarters in Quezon City, Roxas was asked about criticism following a ,heated word war, between himself and presidential aspirant Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte.,Online and offline, people pointed out how the exchange of tirades dumbed down electoral discussion and focused on personalities instead of plans for governance.,\u201c,Siguro, hindi ako nakapagpigil. Ako rin mismo parang nadidismaya ako sa sarili ko na na-,distract, ako. Tayo po ay nais nating iahon ang ating bansa.

At talaga namang lalabanan natin sila,,\u201d Roxas said.,(I guess I wasn\u2019t able to control myself. I\u2019m kind of dismayed at myself too because I allowed myself to be distracted. We want to improve our country. I\u2019m running for president because these bullies, these opportunists, these people who are hindering the progress of our fellowmen \u2013 they need to be stopped. And I\u2019m ready to fight them.),The LP standard-bearer, who was endorsed by President Benigno Aquino III, tried to steer the conversation away from the so-called \"slap challenge\" between the two, pointing out that talk about his supposedly non-existent college degree and slapping does nothing for the country\u2019s 100 million Filipinos.,\u201c,Alam niyo, itong tigas-tigasan, itong siga-siga, bumenta na 'yan eh; gasgas na 'yan. Ako galit ako sa ,bully,. Galit ako sa mga nagsasamantalaga. Galit ako sa mga naghahari-hari. Galit ako sa mga mabibigat ang kamay.

I\u2019m angry at those who take advantage of the situation, I\u2019m angry at those who act like kings. I\u2019m angry at those who are quick to turn to violence. I am angry at people who think they\u2019re the only ones with power in the country. So if you haven't found your match yet, Digong, here I am. I won\u2019t back down.),Still, Roxas went on to \u201cchallenge\u201d Duterte to a physical showdown, a fistfistfight, if need be.,\u201c,Sampalan, anong kinalaman niyan sa 100 million Pilipino? Anong kinalaman niyan sa kung ano ang kinahihinatnan ng ating bansa? Sa dami ng problema na hinaharap ng ating bansa, ikaw nauuwi ka sa kung ano anong mga kalokohan. Gawin mo nalang kung gusto mong gawin, diba? Sampalan? Bakit pa sampalan? Pambabae 'yan. Suntukan na lang,,\u201d added Roxas.,(A slap fight? What does that have to do with 100 million Filipinos? What does that have to do with where we want our country to do? Of all the problems our country is facing, he talks about this tomfoolery. Do what you want to do, right? Slapping each other? That\u2019s for women. Let\u2019s settle this with a fist-fight.),Pressed by reporters on whether he meant it when he dared Duterte to slap him should his Wharton education turn out to be fake, Roxas said: \u201c,And dami niyang sinabi pero hindi naman niya pinaninindigan ang mga sinasabi niya. Dakdak lang nang dakdak eh. Talk talk talk talk talk. Kung gentleman ka, sasabihin mo, 'I was mistaken, I'm sorry.' Eh pinipilit pa rin niya ang maling pananaw niya, eh di hayaan na lang natin. Wala nang mas bulag kaysa sa nagbubulag-bulagan,.\u201d,(He says a lot of things but he can\u2019t stand by them. He keeps on talking. Talk talk talk talk talk. If he\u2019s a gentleman, he should know when to say, 'I was mistaken, I\u2019m sorry.' But he\u2019s still insisting on his wrong views, so let him be. Nobody can be blinder than someone who pretends to be blind.),On Tuesday, Duterte insisted on his position that Roxas had lied about his Wharton degree. (READ: ,Duterte To Roxas: 'UPenn graduate ka, and not Wharton!',),Friends to foes,The word war began on Friday, December 11, after Roxas said it was a \u201cmyth\u201d that Davao City was the safest in the country. Citing data from the Philippine National Police (PNP), which he used to administer as interior secretary, Roxas said Davao had the 4th highest crime incidents in the country in 2014.,Duterte retaliated hours later by saying Roxas could not handle stress, pointing out his supposed incompetence as interior secretary in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in Eastern Visayas. Following his tirades against Roxas, Duterte said he would slap Roxas should they cross paths during the campaign.,The Davao mayor also alleged Roxas\u2019 Wharton education, where he graduated with a degree in Economics, was a \u201cmyth.\u201d,Roxas shot back on Monday, December 14, by egging Duterte to deliver on his \u201cthreat.\" He went one step further by challenging the mayor to a pseudo-slap \"bet\" should he prove that his Wharton degree was genuine.,Speaking to reporters again on Tuesday, Roxas said Duterte was all \u201ctalk.\" He even gave his full home address after the Davao mayor said he was ready to go to ,Roxas\u2019 home in Cubao,, Quezon City, to slap him, as the local official had promised.,But for Duterte, all gloves came off when Roxas supposedly spread \u201cblack propaganda\u201d against him. Duterte accused Roxas, or at least people in his camp, of spreading rumors that he had cancer. The LP and Roxas have denied the allegations.,On Tuesday, Roxas said he was ready to take a lie detector test to prove that he was not involved with Philip Lustre, who reportedly wrote that he had cancer.,\u201c,Hindi ko na alam kung anong patunay pa. Eto, magpa-,lie detector, [ako], hindi naman niya tatanggapin, sasabihin niyang hindi ,admissible in court,. Ang punto ko rito, ako, isang marangal na tao. Hindi ako gumagawa ng ganoong bagay. Sinabi ko na na wala akong kinalaman, tanggapin niya. Ayaw niyang tanggapin eh di ,sorry, na lang. Pero malinis ang konsensiya ko na wala akong kinalaman sa kung anong, black propaganda, na sinabi niya,,\u201d said Roxas.,(I don\u2019t know what else I can say to prove this. I can undergo a lie detector test but Duterte will say that\u2019s not admissible in court. My point is, I\u2019m a person with integrity. I don\u2019t do those things. I\u2019m saying I have nothing do with this but he won\u2019t accept that so sorry. But my conscience is clean that I have nothing to do with the black propaganda he\u2019s accusing me of.),Prior to the verbal exchange, Roxas referred to Duterte as his \"good friend.\" They were both members of Congress in the late 1990s, when Roxas was Capiz representative and Duterte, Davao City representative. Duterte even campaigned for Roxas in 2010 when the latter ran for vice president.,That's all in the past. ,Asked if this would be the last time he would address allegations like Duterte\u2019s, Roxas said while he would \u201cfocus on the issues,\u201d he would not back down from people who spread misinformation.,On Tuesday, Roxas also met with LP leaders and party allies from Mindanao, who pledged to support the LP standard-bearer\u2019s candidacy, even with the Davao mayor in the presidential contest., \u2013 Rappler.com,Who won in the 2016 Philippine elections?,Check out the 2016 official election results through the link below:,Check out the 2016 unofficial election results for the national and local races through the links below,We are agents of change!

{"content": "\nThe Liberal Party believes an endorsement by President Benigno Aquino III will be enough for Interior Secretary Mar Roxas to win the 2016 presidency    ,LP'S PICK. The Liberal Party has yet to announce its 2016 standard bearer but it is largely believed to be Interior Secretary Mar Roxas. File photo by Malaca\u00f1ang Photo Bureau,MANILA, Philippines \u2013  He's supposed to be prepping for a presidential race that his party mates and his biggest supporter, President Benigno Aquino III, hopes he will win. But Interior Secretary Mar Roxas has been bad news lately: from getting criticized for distasteful early campaigning in Yolanda-hit areas to getting suspended by a golf club for breaking the rules. ,And the clincher of them all happened this week: a survey on perceived presidential bets that showed him in single digit, just a percentage point above the senator-son of dictator Ferdinand Marcos.,It started on the first week of April with Roxas' trip to areas hard-hit by ,Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), to distribute reconstruction assistance and funds to local government units. The tour was ,slammed by critics as early campaigning,, something fueled by his ally, Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio \"Jun\" Abaya, who  called him \"President Roxas\" during a stop in Capiz.,Just as the issue died down, Roxas again found himself in the headlines after he made a scene at an exclusive golf club, ,berating employees in Wack Wack Golf and Country Club, over a guest's green fee., What happened next seemed unthinkable: the club slapped Roxas \u2013 presidential buddy, adviser and future standard-bearer of the ruling Liberal Party (LP) \u2013 with a two-month suspension.,Roxas has apologized for the Wack Wack incident, and his camp said, he was warmly received when he went on tour. ,But he is not in a good place.,While President Aquino seems untouchable \u2013 his survey numbers riding high midway through his term \u2013 Roxas is struggling with public opinion.,According to the ,Pulse Asia Ulat ng Bayan Survey for the period March 19-26,, 2014, Vice President Jejomar Binay would be the overwhelming choice for president with 40% selecting him as their first choice if elections were to happen today. In comparison, Roxas rated 6%, earning him a No. 5 rank behind neophyte Senator Grace Poe with 15%, Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago with 10%, and Senator Chiz Escudero with 9%. ,The LP, however, is far from giving up on Roxas. It is hardly concerned with his numbers. Because the ,numbers they care about are Aquino's. And those are high. ,To the LP, as long as Aquino supports Roxas, he will have a good shot at the presidency in 2016.,\"The messaging is continuity. It's not going to be elections as usual. This is an election where you want to see the changes carried on through the next administration,\" Budget Secretary and LP official Butch Abad told Rappler.,The same message was pushed by Aquino himself, just two days after Rappler released the report on the Pulse Asia survey. At a Labor Day event on Thursday, May 1, ,Aquino emphasized continuity, in a surprising speech that saw the President give advice to voters two years before the 2016 polls.,\u201cMy request to you: If you believe that what we are doing is right, if you don\u2019t want what we\u2019ve started on the straight and narrow path to go to waste, let\u2019s pick a leader who will continue and further improve on the reforms we\u2019ve made,\u201d he said.,\u201cLet\u2019s pick someone deserving so that the transformations we want in our society will be permanent and wide-reaching.\u201d,Aquino magic,This is the mindset of the LP now: Aquino's endorsement alone \u2013 given the successes of his administration and his consistently impressive trust ratings \u2013 will be strong enough to pull Roxas from being at the bottom to being a heartbeat away from the presidency.,The LP bases its opinion on Aquino's sky-high numbers. ,Based on the results of the Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey during the first quarter of 2014, 66% or ,nearly 7 in 10 Filipinos expressed satisfaction with Aquino's performance,. Only 21% did not.,The LP is confident the unprecedented numbers will translate to endorsement power.,\"If you step back and recall how he became a candidate, it was actually the people who asked him to run for president. And empirically, if you go by his present approval and trust ratings, that relationship is pretty much there, and it will be very likely that in 2016, the people may go back to him and say, 'Of course you can no longer run for the second term \u2013 who do you think is the best person to succeed you?'\" Abad said.,Abad explained that the trust has been maintained because of the \"palpable benefits\" felt by the people, and the numbers are \"grounded on something concrete.\",\"I think what is important for this administration is that 2016 is not seen as a business-as-usual election. It's an election wherein people have a stake, and will then seriously think about who they will vote for. And I think if you listen to the value sector, everyone is talking about what happens after 2016. That kind of concern, scenario, is seen as intensifying,\" he said.,Because of this, the message that will guide Roxas' campaign come 2016 is continuity.,It's no surprise that the focus of the LP right now \u2013 although elections and Roxas are, and always will be, at the back of their minds \u2013 is ,to ensure the success of the President's programs,.,YOLANDA EFFECT. Secretary Mar Roxas, pictured here with Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez, sees his numbers drop after Super Typhoon Yolanda for what Filipinos perceive as poor handling of the rehabilitation efforts. File photo by Mike Alquinto/DILG ,Not only will instituted reforms cement Aquino's legacy, it is also what they believe would make Roxas win.,\"It's premature [to campaign],\" said Abad. \"The preoccupation now of government is to make sure that all the President's programs succeed.\",\"At the end of the day, whoever [is] his successor will benefit greatly if the government is able to succeed in implementing his social and economic programs because what those programs will do will create more stakeholders for reform, and therefore it will naturally come to them that if the new administration that will succeed the Aquino administration is also committed to the President's social contract.\",Roxas himself, when asked about his low survey numbers, ,drew attention to the work still left to do,.,\"I'm focused on my job and I don't give mind to these things,\" he said.,Ongoing preparations,His response is not entirely accurate.,In the beginning of April, ,Roxas visited Tacloban, Palo, Tanauan, Baybay and Ormoc in Leyte, and stopped by his home province of Capiz,, to distribute, in behalf of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), typhoon relief money to local governments.,They were visits that had been prepared for months in advance with utmost care and attention \u2013 by his campaign staff.,He was doing his job, but for those helping him in his campaign, the focus was on the details of Roxas' demeanor and how he carried himself.,EARLY CAMPAIGN? Critics question Interior Secretary Mar Roxas' intentions during his tour of Yolanda-hit areas after his party mate and Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya refers to him as 'president.' Photo by Mike Alquinto/DILG,Roxas is being groomed by a team solely committed to ensuring his victory. Aside from LP veterans, the team includes names that have helped Roxas in his campaign before: former Alaminos (Pangasinan) mayor and defeated gubernatorial bet Hernani Braganza and Silvestre \"Yong\" Afable. He also gets occasional advice from American political strategist Paul Bograd, a long-time personal friend.,Everything from messaging, to stance, to surveys are scrutinized in an effort to make Roxas the next president of the Philippines.,There's work to do, especially after Yolanda sank Roxas' numbers, because of what the ,public perceived as poor relief management by government, in the wake of the typhoon \u2013 operations led by Roxas himself. ,According to the Roxas campaign source, the team has started studying surveys and working on party consolidation.,Abad said he is not aware of the team's specific plans but said it is only natural for Roxas to be preparing as early as now.,\"I would be lying if I say somebody who is being considered for the highest position is not preparing himself. He has to, he owes that to the party,\" Abad told Rappler. ,\"But the real question is: how do you do it? [Roxas] doesn't want to be distracted from his own work,\" he said.,No announcement,Within the LP, Roxas is understood to be the standard bearer for the 2016 polls, although the formal selection process based on the party's constitution has yet to begin.,Aside from his reference to Roxas as \"president,\" Abaya, LP's acting president, also recently confirmed that Roxas is the party's likely bet. He too admitted they have not yet undergone a formal selection process, but noted nobody else is being considered, and that the party is in \"consensus and in unison\" over Roxas' candidacy.,The idea of Roxas as LP's presidential bid is so widespread that pressure within the party for Roxas to declare his candidacy has been mounting \u2013 especially ,after several politicians have made known their plans, to run for the country's top post, said the source familiar with Roxas' campaign plans.,But no announcement will be made anytime soon.,LATE ANNOUNCEMENT. President Benigno Aquino III has yet to give Secretary Mar Roxas the go-signal to run because he needs him to continue working on the government's programs including Yolanda rehabilitation. File photo by Malacanang Photo Bureau,An announcement by Roxas would automatically mean a resignation from his current post as head of the DILG, said one of his advisers. Aquino has yet to give Roxas the go-signal.,In July 1991, then Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos resigned from his post after he decided to join the 1992 presidential race. Former Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro did the same thing in November 2009 \u2013 6 months before the 2010 presidential elections. Teodoro lost to his cousin Aquino.,With the ,task of ensuring Yolanda rehabilitation,, among other duties, Roxas will not be making an announcement on his candidacy any time soon \u2013 not until 2015. ,At that point, Roxas is expected to leave his Cabinet post. And Aquino could well be his campaign manager.,'Time will come',Aside from having to lose its interior and local government secretary if Roxas were to announce his candidacy, the LP knows that an early declaration would hurt Roxas' chances.,Western Samar Representative Mel Sarmiento, LP secretary-general, explained that elections are always more nuanced for any ruling party, which simply cannot think of elections as early as other parties.,Sarmiento said the LP has not even been able to meet as regularly as before, given the slew of demands and the sheer amount of work to be done.,\"The time will come,\" Sarmiento said, referring to the party's formal selection of its standard bearer.,Abad too said the announcement \"will be dictated by many factors.\",\"People will not take it kindly if government engages in partisanship when there is reconstruction work that needs to be done, huge infrastructure backlog for which we have budgeted, preparation for APEC \u2013 our coming-out party,\" he said. ,Abad pointed to Roxas' Yolanda tour, saying that if Roxas were to announce his candidacy now, people would even be \"more negative,\" even if he is only doing his work.,CRITICISM. International news organizations slam the government response to Typhoon Yolanda, led by Interior Secretary Mar Roxas. Screengrab from CNN ,\"Now that he's getting things moving, he's being misinterpreted as campaigning. [Now] he's very careful, there's lots of pressure to get things done,\" he said.,\"[But] that doesn't stop people from sniping at ,Mar,.\",The ,Mar, problem,Critics, including a political veteran closely working with another presidential candidate, told Rappler the problem isn't misinterpretation but Roxas himself.,The source said Roxas is simply unable to connect with Filipinos on a personal basis, and just has no natural link to voters. He is perceived as out of touch and temperamental.,So far, Roxas also has had no defining moment in his career that makes him memorable or significant, said the source. In fact, what has been his unforgettable moments recently have been largely viewed as negative: his handling of the ,Zamboanga siege, and the ,aftermath of Yolanda,. ,As a senator, Roxas also hedged his stance on issues, was usually late to criticize other officials, and was hesitant to voice his position on crucial matters, the source added.,To this political veteran, relying on an endorsement is flawed because it is not enough to win an election, especially in the case of Roxas who's struggling in surveys.,'SURVEYS CAN CHANGE'. Secretary Mar Roxas' allies say the reception of Roxas on the ground is warm, and believe surveys can change.

President Rodrigo Duterte calls on Filipinos to remember the sacrifices made by those who fought for Philippine independence. Malaca\u00f1ang file photo ,MANILA, Philippines (2nd UPDATE) \u2013 In his first Independence Day message while in power, President Rodrigo Duterte called on his countrymen to help preserve Philippine sovereignty as a way to honor the country's heroes.,\"Let us pay homage to their heroism by preserving our sovereignty and performing our own civic rights and responsibilities,\" said Duterte in a message sent to media to commemorate the 119th Proclamation of Philippine Independence on Monday, June 12. (READ: ,Philippine Independence Day 2017 events,),But at the last minute, the ,President skipped the rites ,in Luneta. Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella did not give a reason for his absence, but Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano ,said he was told the President was not feeling well., ,The President, who often likes to talk about the country's colonial past in his speeches, recalled how Filipinos of bygone times sacrificed their lives for the Philippines to become a full-fledged nation.,\"The journey to freedom was a long and arduous one \u2013 which our countrymen paid for with blood, sweat, and the ultimate act of selfless sacrifice,\" he said.,Duterte has never hesitated to express his anger, even disgust, at countries which colonized the Philippines, including the United States and Spain., ,In speeches, he has condemned human rights abuses by American soldiers seeking to subjugate Muslims in Jolo in the early 20th century. ,He has also frequently expressed derision for the claim of \"discovery\" of the Philippines by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan when natives were \"doing perfectly right on our own.\",To honor Lapu-Lapu as the first Filipino who resisted Spanish rule, ,Duterte created the Order of Lapu-Lapu, with which to award persons supportive of his administration's programs.,\"Let us take inspiration from our forebears who valiantly fought and offered their lives that we may have the liberties that we enjoy today,\" he said in his message.,The country celebrates Independence Day amid several challenges to sovereignty and national security. In Mindanao, government troops are on their 21st day of clashes with the local terrorist Maute Group. June 12 is also the 21st day of martial law in Mindanao.,Duterte said he ,declared martial law, due to the threat ,posed by the Islamic State (ISIS),, an international terrorist group that supposedly seeks to establish a ,wilayat, or province in Mindanao.,In the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea), the country has not dropped its claim over the area even if it overlaps with the expansive claim of regional power China.

Despite the insurmountable hardships, the patriotism and undaunted spirit of the Filipino led to our triumph against the shackles of slavery and abuse.,On that day, we showed our colonizers and the rest of the world what we Filipinos are made of.

{"content": "\nAbe\u2019s diplomatic skills are put to a test by two leaders with a similar volatile temperament    , ,TOKYO, Japan \u2013 It\u2019s new normal for Japan these days. Two new world leaders with a similar volatile temperament are putting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s diplomatic skills to a test, leading him into tricky terrain.,But it appears that Abe has forged initial successes, hitting it off with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who ,visited here in October,, and with US incoming ,President Donald Trump,, whom Abe met with in New York. Abe\u2019s visit was unusual, apparently the first by a Japanese head of state to a leader who has yet to assume office. ,\u201cWhat is most important is the establishment of personal relations between Abe and Trump, and Duterte,\u201d Takashi Shiraishi, president of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS), told me in an interview in his office in the bustling district of Roponggi. \u201cThe nitty gritty can be done at the operational level.\u201d,With the personal chemistry between Abe and the two leaders appearing to work out, Japan may have to step up its role in the region with Trump\u2019s still uncertain position on US military presence here, following his \u201cAmerica First\u201d stance. While Japan is definitely not going to be a military power, it has been beefing up its maritime security relations with ASEAN countries, highlighting the importance of its Coast Guard. ,The Philippines is one of the beneficiaries. Through a loan, Japan is providing 10 ,vessels, to the Philippine Coast Guard. These will be used in patrolling our waters, including the Scarborough Shoal area.,\u201cInternational relations in the region are spoken about as if the US and China were the only powers,\u201d Shiraishi pointed out. In the case of Duterte, \u201che needs a country to serve as balance versus China. It\u2019s fine with us, this role comes to us naturally. Japan welcomes the opportunity for Abe to show that Japan matters.\u201d,For Masashi Nishihara, president of the Research Institute for Peace and Security, a think tank, \u201cJapan is in transition between the US and the Philippines.\u201d But through its \u201cdiplomatic activities,\u201d Japan can make up for a limited US role in the region \u2013 should this happen, Nishihara added. The strengthening of maritime capacities is one such step.,Abe-Duterte summit,Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs I spoke with said they are satisfied with the results of Duterte\u2019s visit. They commonly pointed out the Japan-Philippines ,joint statement, as proof of the success, focusing on maritime security cooperation, \u201cnot like a Christmas-tree statement that includes everything.\u201d ,Two items, in particular, stand out, from their point of view:,What is not explicitly stated in the \u201cnetwork of friendships and alliances\u201d is the US military presence in the region, including in the Philippines. The US-Japan security alliance is a pillar in Japan\u2019s relations with other countries in Asia and Southeast Asia. \u201cOne of the biggest deterrents versus China is the presence of the US,\u201d Atsuyuki Fujinuma of MOFA\u2019s Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, said. ,Before Duterte visited Tokyo, he had made pronouncements about letting the ,American forces,  in Mindanao go and severing ,military exercises, between the Philippines and the US, rankling Japan. But the nervousness here eased after Duterte and Abe met. ,Duterte\u2019s pivot, to China also worried Japan, which is beleaguered by Chinese incursions into Senkaku islands, a situation similar to the West Philippine Sea. When the Philippines won its case versus China in the arbitral tribunal, ,Japan, was one of the most outspoken supporters of the ruling.,Duterte assuaged Abe during the visit. Notes from the 2 leaders\u2019 meeting, given out by MOFA, show this:,      \u201cPresident Duterte commented that since an arbitral award has been issued in regard to the South China Sea issue, there is no choice but to hold discussions based on this\u2026President Duterte added that since the Philippines is always in the same standpoint as Japan, Japan should feel peace of mind, and that in regard to maritime issues, it is necessary to ensure freedom of navigation.\u201d,Sake, snowy mountains,What is interesting are the little signs of friendship that the MOFA officials noticed during Duterte\u2019s visit. Among others:,When Duterte was mayor, he visited Japan both as a private citizen and as a guest of MOFA. The visitors\u2019 program of MOFA includes trips outside Tokyo to make their guests experience various facets of Japan. They still have old photos of Duterte posing with the snowy mountains as backdrop.,In May, the Japanese ambassador to Manila was the first, among diplomats, to pay a call on then president-elect ,Duterte,. This feat was followed by a scheduled official visit of Duterte to Tokyo, supposed to be the first overseas trip of the president. But China raced ahead and got Duterte to make Beijing his first visit.,The order of the visit doesn\u2019t really matter now, I gathered in conversations, because Duterte\u2019s trip to Japan turned out well. Optimism about bilateral relations is in the air here as Japan continues to keep close ties with the Philippines, one of its most important partners in the region. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Rappler editor at large Marites Danguilan Vitug was invited by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) as part of its visitors\u2019 program from December 4 to 11, 2016.

That is a myth. You did not graduate [from] Wharton, Mr. Roxas. Wala doon sa listahan na ikaw naka-kumpleto ng 4 years or 5 years for a degree. Tanungin mo ang Wharton, (You aren\u2019t on the list of those who completed a 4- or 5-year degree. You ask Wharton),\u201d Duterte said in his \u201cGikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa\u201d episode on Sunday, December 13.,Said Roxas on Monday, December 14, in a chance interview with reporters: ,\u201cKung hindi totoo ang Wharton degree ko, sampalin mo ako. Hindi ako iiwas o iilag. Pero kung totoo ang Wharton degree ko, sasampalin kita. O ayan. Ang bilis mong magsalita na hindi mo alam eh.\u201d,(If my Wharton degree is a lie, he can slap me. I won\u2019t avoid it. But if it\u2019s true that I have a Wharton degree, I\u2019ll slap him. There. He finds it so easy to say things that he doesn\u2019t know.) ,NOT BACKING DOWN. Presidential candidate Mar Roxas dares his rival Rodrigo Duterte to slap him. File photo by Jansen Romero/Rappler ,The exchange is the latest in a word war between Roxas and Duterte, who once considered each other friends. ,It began on Friday, December 11, following a forum in Quezon City, where Roxas said it was a \u201cmyth\u201d that Davao City was the most peaceful in the country. Citing data from the Philippine National Police (PNP), Roxas said Davao ranked 4th highest in crime incidents in the country in 2014.,Duterte retaliated hours after during an event in Taguig City, detailing Roxas\u2019 supposed lackluster performance as interior chief in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). ,\u201c,Pag-magkita kami sa isang kanto dito sa kampanya, sampalin ko yang gagong yan,,\u201d the Philippine Star quoted Duterte as saying after his \u201cexpos,\u00e9,\u201d on Roxas.  ,(If we see each other during the campaign trail, I\u2019ll slap that idiot.)  ,Roxas also reacted to Duterte\u2019s \u201cthreat,\u201d egging on the tough-talking Davao mayor to do it sooner than later.  ,\u201c,Sampalin niya ako, punta siya dito. Kundi, punta ako Davao, sampalin niya ako sa airport. Tingnan natin. Ang mahirap kay Mayor Digong Duterte, nasanay siya sa one-man rule, nasanay siya na kung hindi niya nakukuha ang gusto niya, kung may nagsasabi sa kanya ng katotohanan ay mananampal nalang siya o pagbubuhatan niya ng kamay. Subukan natin, tingnan natin,,\u201d he told reporters.  ,(He can come here and slap me. Or I can go to Davao, he can slap me at the airport. Let\u2019s see. That\u2019s what\u2019s difficult about Mayor Digong Duterte, he\u2019s used to a one-man rule. He\u2019s just turning to force whenever he doesn\u2019t get what he wants or when he\u2019s told the truth. Let\u2019s see.) ,In the latest \u201cGikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa\u201d episode, Duterte criticized Roxas for saying that Davao wasn\u2019t the safest city, pointing out that it wasn\u2019t for the LP standard-bearer to make those claims. \u201cIt is for the Davaoe\u00f1os to say what this is all about,\u201d added Duterte.,TOUGH-TALKING MAYOR. Rodrigo Duterte fired back at Mar Roxas after the latter's remarks on peace and order in Davao City. File photo by Jansen Romero/Rappler ,Survey in Camp Crame?, ,Duterte went on the offensive against Roxas, reminding him that administrative oversight of the PNP, including the Davao police, was part of his job as former Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) secretary. ,\u201c,Ikaw yung may hawak ng pulis. Bakit hindi mo (expletive) sa Davao? Either nabola ka ng pulis mo or you were treated by trash by the police. Magpa-survey ka sa Crame, kung manalo ka, kakampanyahan kita,,\u201d said Duterte. ,(The police were under you. Why didn\u2019t you chastise Davao? It\u2019s either you were fooled by the police or they treated you like trash. Have a survey conducted in Crame. If you win, I\u2019ll campaign for you.)  ,On Monday, Roxas reminded Duterte that as chairman of the Davao region\u2019s Peace and Order Council, he had the discretion to pick the city and regional police chiefs. He also reminded the Davao mayor that the police force are protectors, and not hitmen. ,In a previous interview with Rappler, Duterte said he would tap the police and military as the \u201cbackbone\u201d of his planned dictatorship.,\u201c',Yan ang mga uri ng pag-iisip na karahasan, ng kabigatan ng kamay na wala nang lugar sa ating lipunan. 'Yan 'yung madilim na nakaraan, (That\u2019s the kind of thinking that has no place in our society. That\u2019s part of the dark past),\u201d Roxas said.  ,Friendly past,Words exchanged between Roxas and Duterte have not always been so heated. The two know each other from their times as members of Congress \u2013 Roxas as Capiz representative and Duterte as Davao City\u2019s representative.  ,Duterte, in an interview on \u201cGikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa,\u201d said it was Roxas who started it all, when the latter allegedly spread cancer rumors against the Davao mayor. Duterte has long insisted Roxas\u2019 camp was behind the \u201cblack propaganda,\u201d a claim the LP and Roxas have denied.  ,Despite attempts to cut Duterte since they were running out of time, the Davao mayor went on to berate Roxas: \u201c,Ah pati 'yung sa Yolanda, (There\u2019s also Yolanda). ,I was there day 2. Mr Roxas, you cannot handle stress that I can tell the Filipino people. He cannot handle stress, nagtatatala, (he kept yapping).\u201d,Roxas also had strong words for his former friend, who campaigned for him heavily in 2010 when he ran for vice president. \u201c,Alam mo Digong, ang turing ko sa iyo, kaibigan. Nirespeto kita, pinahalagahan ko ang aking pagkakaibigan sa iyo, pero mabuti na rin lang na nakita na natin ang katotohanan ng pagkatao mo,,\u201d he said.  ,(You know, Digong, I treated you as a friend. I respected you, I valued our friendship, but it\u2019s good that we see you for who you really are.),Duterte, according to a survey privately commissioned by a Davao-based supporter, leads the latest nationwide surveys.

Palma then asked Aquino about Binay, who is also a longtime family friend. (See the editor's note below.) ,Before ,resigning ,to formally lead the opposition in June, Binay was both housing czar and presidential adviser on overseas Filipino workers' affairs. Aquino appointed him to the posts at the start of the administration in 2010.,As head of HUDCC, Binay led key housing agencies like the National Housing Authority (NHA), the Home Guaranty Corp, and the Home Development Mutual Fund or Pag-IBIG Fund.,When Palma followed up and asked Aquino if Binay was indeed not accused of corruption while heading HUDCC, Aquino responded, \u201cKnock on wood.\u201d, ,Binay faces a yearlong Senate inquiry, and Ombudsman and money-laundering investigations for supposedly approving overpriced projects when he was mayor of Makati for 21 years. Binay was Makati mayor from 1986 to 2010, except for a 3-year gap where he sat out a term limit.  ,His critics said he allegedly earned kickbacks from projects whose bidding was rigged. ,Binay is chairman of the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) while Aquino heads the ruling Liberal Party (LP).,'Economic growth nothing to smirk about',Aquino commented on, the corruption allegations, against Binay. ,\u201cYou know, through the years there have always been rumors,\u201d Aquino said.,\u201cBut this is the first time that we've seen \u2013 ,parang ,(it seems) evidence, it seems \u2026 to support those allegations,\u201d he added.,Aquino also took exception to Binay's criticism of his government as laid out in the Vice President's so-called \u201c,True State of the Nation Address,\" in  August. ,In that speech, Binay said that while the Philippines' foreign direct investments (FDI) reached over $6 billion in 2014, it was the lowest in the region. He said the country lagged behind Singapore with $67 billion, Indonesia with $25 billion, Thailand with $11 billion, and Malaysia with over $10 billion.,Binay also said that the FDI did not generate jobs for the majority but only went to financial and insurance activities which create a few jobs.,In response, Aquino said Binay must put the FDI growth in perspective. He said the number rose from $1 billion to $6 billion.,\u201cIn a sense [his comment is] true but where were [the other countries] coming from versus from where were we coming from? We were nowhere in the investment horizon or radar of so many investors, and our point now was 600% growth is nothing to smirk about,\u201d the President said.,Aquino said his own address to Congress was meant to highlight these achievements.,\u201cAll I was saying is, in the past 5 years, these are the changes.\u201d,In campaigning for president, Binay criticizes the administration's \u201cfailed, insensitive\u201d leadership to highlight the need for change. He often calls attention to the lack of inclusive growth, poor Metro Rail Transit (MRT) services, heavy traffic in Manila, and the supposed \u201cselective justice\u201d targeting opposition members.,Yet Aquino and critics point out that the Vice President was part of the administration for 5 years. The President also said that Binay ,criticizes without presenting solutions, and a clear program of government. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,(,Editor's note: An earlier version of this story reported that President Aquino said Binay did nothing as housing czar. We corrected the story to reflect the full context of the President's statements, which began when he was asked about his friendship with ,former Land Transportation Office chief ,Virginia Torres,. Torres reportedly dropped Aquino's name to negotiate ,an illegal deal involving smuggled sugar with the Bureau of Customs. We regret the error. ,Here is the Q and A from the interview on the topic:,Monzon-Palma: But you have a friend who is now a former ex-LTO person who is being linked to an attempt to smuggle smuggled sugar at the Bureau of Customs. I mean, how are you taking that and do you believe the story that you've read? Have you called her and asked her: What's going on?\",Aquino: You know, unfortunately, and I have to confess this, I found out all about it because of the article in the paper rather than the Bureau of Customs, for instance, telling me about it and reporting it or even submitting a formal report. And I still have to talk to\u2014I have to ask them that question. But I think what is important there is assuming I have a friend who tried this, there is also another friend in the person of Jess Dellosa who is in charge of that field that assuming it happened, thwarted the thing, there is no damage to the state.,Monzon-Palma: But this kind of friendship and we don\u2019t know whether  you actually are a friend of her so they say that you are friends. I mean, how do you maintain a relationship with these people that you have appointed and then all of a sudden fell from...,Aquino: The definition of friendship is that, \u2018di ba, ito ang landas ko e. Kapag gagawa ka nang salungat sa landas ko, hindi tayo magkaibigan. Kapag i-importahan mo ako na gumawa ng hindi ko kaya or hindi ko nagawa, or ikaw gumawa ng alam mong hindi ko gagawin, hindi na tayo magkaibigan.,Monzon-Palma: Ano nabigla ka 'nung nabasa mo? All along these years hindi mo akalain na meron siyang ganoong business? Tumutulong sa mga...,Aquino: Pero parang\u2026 Just on what was on the paper, she is supposed to be sugar planter. She has leased land in Tarlac after her stint in the LTO. Does it make sense for her to facilitate sugar smugglers that will depress the prices of the product that she has invested in? That is the only thing na off hand. Hindi yata logical ito.,Monzon-Palma: She is a sugar planter...,Aquino: A new sugar planter.,Monzon-Palma: A new sugar planter. Ilang ektarya po ang...,Aquino: I don't know but this was after her LTO stint.,Monzon-Palma: And she has not tried to call you to explain, \u201cBoss...\u201d,Aquino: There was a text message in all honesty to one of my assistants, and said: \"Sobra ito, to think of showing people, et cetera... I haven't talked to her about it.,Monzon-Palma: You haven't talked to her about this case. You define friendship against her. What is your definition of friendship?,Aquino: If our friendship is based on your ability to use me, well therefore, we are not friends. If your interest, your aims are contrary to what I want to do, then we also cannot be friends. So, the friendship aspect there is 'di ba, two-way street. Iyong you can count on me because I can count on you. And when I count on you, there are certain parameters that these are\u2014'this is okay, this is not okay.' Smuggling definitely is not okay. Influence peddling is not okay.,Monzon-Palma: Okay.

File photo by Edwin Espejo/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the New People's Army (NPA) on Friday, August 19, declared a 7-day unilateral ceasefire days before peace talks are set to resume between communist rebels and the Philippine government.,In a statement, the CPP-NPA said the ceasefire will take effect starting 12:01 am on Sunday, August 21, until 11:59 pm of Saturday, August 27.,It will cover the ,5-day peace talks, to be held in Oslo, Norway, between the negotiating panels of the government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the CPP's political arm.,\"This ceasefire declaration is encouraged by the GRP's facilitation of the release of nearly all NDFP consultants who are set to participate in peace negotiations in the course of the next several months,\" the CPP-NPA said.,Earlier on Friday, NDFP consultants Benito Tiamzon and Wilma Tiamzon were ,temporarily released, to allow them to participate in the Oslo talks.,The CPP said it is anticipating the release of the rest of the NDFP consultants who are expected to join the negotiations.,The group also reiterated its \"deep appreciation of the determined efforts of GRP President [Rodrigo] Duterte to push forward and accelerate the GRP-NDFP peace negotiations as a means of addressing the roots of the civil war in the Philippines.\",\"We hope that this ceasefire declaration will be reciprocated by the GRP as a show of all-out determination to move forward with peace negotiations,\" it added.,The CPP also said that it is open to discuss the possibility of a longer ceasefire once all political prisoners are released.,In a statement sent to media early Saturday August 20, Palace Communication Secretary Martin Andanar said the President \"has already walked an extra mile for peace\" and that Duterte is glad the CPP-NPA \"showed a similar gesture of goodwill as a sign of sincerity\" to the peace talks.,\"We therefore feel optimistic that the mutual efforts of both sides would lead to fruitful negotiations that could pave the way for substantive discussions in the hope of putting an end to one of Asia\u2019s longest-running insurgencies,\" he added.,But Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto urged the government to match the 7-day ceasefire with its own declaration of a longer ceasefire.,\u201cAny pause in fighting is good news. But the way forward is for the government to respond with its own ceasefire, one that is longer, so that when it is the CPP's turn to respond and they do so positively, then it will have the effect of extending the duration of the truce,\" Recto said. ,He added: \"What the people want is peace that is sustained.

{"content": " ATTACKED. The Supreme Court of Justice headquarters building in Caracas on June 13 2017. Luis Robayo AFP CARACAS Venezuela 3rd UPDATE Venezuela s army has been put on alert after 4 grenades were hurled at the Supreme Court from a helicopter President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday June 27 in a potentially dramatic escalation of the violence gripping the oil rich South American country.The helicopter assault comes a day after Maduro announced the arrests of 5 opponents he accused of plotting against him to clear the way for a US invasion.The beleaguered president who for weeks has been thundering about alleged coup attempts against him said the helicopter was flown by a pilot who worked for a former minister.Around 15 shots were fired at the Interior Ministry Maduro added. I have activated the entire armed forces to defend the peace he said in remarks from the Miraflores presidential palace. Sooner or later we are going to capture that helicopter and those that carried out this terror attack. No one was hurt in the incident he said. xa0The government identified the helicopter pilot as a former member of Venezuela s main police force known as the CICPC.Maduro called on the opposition MUD alliance to denounce the attack but one of its leaders Freddy Guevara tweeted there was not yet enough information to comment.Guevara urged people to take part in anti government rallies Wednesday the latest in nearly three months of daily streets protests that have left 76 people dead.Photos circulating on social media showed a helicopter flying over Caracas with a banner that read 350 Freedom alluding to a constitutional clause recently invoked by the opposition to assert the Maduro government s lack of legitimacy.The photos showed two people on the chopper one with his face covered with a mask and the other with it visible.Videos on social media showed a man who identified himself as a CICPC detective and said he was fighting tyranny wants Maduro to resign and for Venezuela to hold early elections.Anti US tiradeEarlier Tuesday Maduro repeated claims of a US backed coup attempt and angrily warned President Donald Trump that Venezuela would fight back against such a move. If Venezuela were dragged into chaos and violence... we would fight Maduro bellowed in a speech to supporters.If a coup prevented his side fulfilling his contested reform plans he said we would achieve it by arms. He said an armed intervention in his country would spark a crisis that would dwarf those caused by conflicts in the Middle East.Addressing Trump he said You are responsible for restraining the madness of the Venezuelan right wing. The opposition regularly accuses Maduro of repressing and jailing opponents. Judicial NGO Foro Penal says there are 383 political prisoners in Venezuela.Addressing a crowd over the weekend Maduro said detainees would face military trial over an alleged coup plot backed by Venezuelan opposition leaders and aimed at precipitating a US intervention in the country. I am not exaggerating when I say it would have involved the arrival of American ships and troops in Venezuelan waters on Venezuelan soil Maduro said.And on Saturday the head of the Organization of American States dug his heels in a war of words with Caracas flatly rejecting its demand that he resign.Maduro had suggested that Luis Almagro who has criticized the Venezuelan government for violating human rights interfering in elections and detaining political prisoners step down in exchange for the country s continued membership in the regional body.Though Almagro dismissed that notion the OAS General Assembly was unable to reach agreement on a plan to deal with the instability in Venezuela at a meeting in Cancun last week.

The Constitution says the President can realign savings within the executive department\u2026so that power cannot be delegated to the Cabinet secretary.\u201d,Carpio said by requiring the concurrence of the Senate finance committee and House appropriations committee in realignment, the 2013 GAA again violated the Constitution.,\u201cRight then and there, there is facially a provision that is unconstitutional, two already. The power given to Cabinet secretaries to realign, that\u2019s unconstitutional on its face. You don\u2019t need a COA (Commission on Audit) report for that. The power given to the Senate committee, to the House committee to concur before there can be realignment, that\u2019s unconstitutional on its face. Correct?\u201d,Alfredo Molo III, counsel for petitioner, said, \u201cCorrect.\u201d,Carpio said these are not the only possible grounds for declaring the 2013 GAA unconstitutional. The justice also said the 2013 GAA allowed individual lawmakers, not Congress as a whole, to identify projects after the enactment of the law.,\u201cWhen the legislator identifies this project as my project, that is binding already on the executive. The executive cannot change that without the concurrence of the Senate or House committee, correct?\u201d,Molo said, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d,Carpio added that the PDAF on its face also violates the President's power to veto line items in the budget, and thus removes checks and balances. Since legislators identify which projects will be funded by their pork barrel only after the budget law has been passed, it effectively skips the President\u2019s chance to veto.,\u201cThe PDAF is also a circumvention of the power of the President to veto line items,\" Carpio said.,In answering questions from various justices, Molo also maintained that actions of legislators coming after the enactment of the budget law are unconstitutional. ,At the start of the proceedings, Molo argued why the PDAF is unconstitutional. \"It allows legislators post-enactment to execute projects. It crosses the line between the executive and the legislative.\",Watch a video report on the proceedings below., ,Past SC rulings not precedents,Carpio also pointed out that the previous Supreme Court rulings upholding the legality of the PDAF are not applicable to the current case that\u2019s based on the 2013 GAA.,The Court upheld the constitutionality of the PDAF in Philippine Constitution Association (Philconsa) v Enriquez in 1994, Andres Sarmiento et al v the Treasurer of the Philippines et al in 2001, and Lawyers Against Monopoly and Poverty (LAMP) v Secretary of Budget and Management in 2012.,Carpio said: \u201cIn Philconsa and in LAMP, we said the identification [of the lawmaker\u2019s project] is only recommendatory\u2026. So clearly in Philconsa, the provision before the Court was a purely recommendatory PDAF, the legislator just recommends, on its face. In Philconsa, the court decided the case different from the provisions before us now. There\u2019s no comparison at all.\u201d,\u201cHere it is mandatory. So Philconsa is not a precedent. It is a different animal from what we are facing today,\u201d Carpio said.,The justice added, \"It\u2019s only in 2013 you can find this. It looks like the department of budget just put into the law their practice. It accumulated. At first, they were cognizant that the legislator cannot execute the GAA, [the power is] only recommendatory but they forgot that so they put everything in the 2013 budget.\u201d,In an interview before the start of the oral arguments, Solicitor General Francis Jardeleza said the government holds a different view.,\u201cThe position of the government is that the rulings of the SC continue to be valid and we will try to convince the court that despite the COA report, there\u2019s still no violation. All the previous rulings \u2013 Philconsa, Sarmiento, LAMP \u2013 our position is they\u2019re still valid,\u201d Jardeleza said.,Basis for using Malampaya fund repealed,In questioning Molo, Carpio also said that the use of the Malampaya fund for purposes beyond energy development may also be unconstitutional.,Petitioners are questioning the provision in Presidential Decree No 910 that the fund may be used for energy exploration, exploitation and development \u201cand for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President.\u201d,Carpio traced the history of the presidential decree. It was enacted during martial law, so it was lawful for the President to hold both executive and legislative powers.,\u201cBut when Congress was restored under 1987 Constitution, there was now a problem because the President cannot exercise the power to appropriate anymore\u2026. So it became unconstitutional when Congress convened, correct? When Congress convened, President Cory Aquino lost her legislative powers.\",\u201cSo that simple: on its face, Malampaya fund [and] PD 910 giving the President the power to use the fund for any purpose, on its face, that is unconstitutional?\u201d,Molo said, \u201cCorrect.\u201d,Carpio also said allowing the President to use the fund for any purpose is \u201can abdication of the power of Congress to appropriate.\u201d,Molo concurred.,The government will present its case when the oral arguments resume on Thursday, October 10. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/40865-oral-arguments-pdaf-malampaya-illegal", "title": "PDAF, Malampaya 'illegal on its face'", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/109114-maria-ozawa-adult-film-porn-industry-cesar-montano,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/69320-ellen-adarna-esquire-magazine-photos-leaked,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/145834-bongbong-marcos-walks-isabelle-daza-adrien-semblat-wedding,http://www.rappler.com/nation/156674-duterte-christmas-eve-photos"},

Vice President and presidential candidate Jejomar Binay addresses the crowd during a campaign rally inside the San Rafael Municipal Gymnasium in San Rafael, Bulacan. File photo by Lito Boras/Rappler  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Presidential candidate and Vice President Jejomar Binay is administratively liable for grave misconduct, dishonesty and gross inexcusable negligence, graft and corrupt practices in connection with the allegedly overpriced Makati City Hall Parking Building II.,This was among the findings of a special 148-page audit report of the Commission on Audit (COA) verified and sworn to on Monday, March 7. The audit covered the controversial 11-story, P2.28-billion ($48.8 million) project initiated in 2007 during the last term of Binay as Makati mayor. (READ: ,Binay\u2019s Makati building overshoots budget,),Assistant Audit Commissioner Alexander B. Juliano approved the recommendation of the 12-member team, which said they are presenting their findings for further investigation and filing of appropriate charges before the Office of the Ombudsman.,The COA report had 2 major findings:,(1) The construction of 5 phases of the Makati City Hall Parking Building II totaling P2.28 billion showed \"irregularities from budgeting to procurement to execution resulting in misuse of public funds.\",(2) The contract for architectural and engineering services with contractor MANA Architecture and Interior Design Co (MANA) amounting to P11.97 million (around $256,000) is not covered by an appropriation, and was awarded through \"simulated bidding and payments\" that were not supported with documents and required information.,The same report said Hilmarc\u2019s Construction and MANA, which bagged contracts from the Makati City government, got undue advantage to the detriment of the city government. ,Binay may be liable for both administrative and possibly criminal acts that carry penalties ranging from fines and imprisonment to removal from office or perpetual disqualification from holding public office. The grant of undue advantage to MANA and Hilmarc's is a violation of the Anti Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.,Irregularities,The audit traced irregularities such as the following:,Among others, Binay was found to have approved contracts with Hilmarc's Construction Corp for phases I-II, while his son, dismissed Makati mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay Jr, approved contracts for phases III-V \"without real competitive public bidding\" and without submitting complete supporting documents.,When he was mayor, the Vice President approved contracts with Hilmarc's for the construction of the 11-story building with roof deck at a total cost of P2.28 billion as-built without the corresponding ABC. This resulted in \"excessive and unconscionable cost difference of P1.9 billion ($40.7 million)\" from the original P283 million.,At various phases of the project, father and son were found to have signed certificates of completion and acceptance, and to have approved change orders and accomplishment reports for billings without complete supporting documents.,MANA contract,Insofar as MANA is concerned, COA found that the Makati city government entered into a contract agreement in 2007 without any corresponding appropriation and prior authorization required by law.,The negotiated procurement was tainted with irregularities like simulated bidding as seen in the presence of \"fictitious bidders and dubious bidding documents, and lack of track record of the winning bidder.\",At the time it was awarded the architecture and engineering services contract, MANA was only a newly registered general professional partnership with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2007, only 4 months before the purported bidding on November 22 of the same year. It did not even submit a valid business permit. ,Payments to MANA were not supported with proof of accomplishments, outputs or reports and other relevant documents and information as required, the COA report said.,Based on the bids submitted by 7 bidders for the project, the report said it appears that only MANA was aware of the approved budget for the contract amounting to P11.99 million ($257,000), \"indicating that it was a favored bidder.\" It was the sole bidder that submitted a bid slightly lower than the approved budget \u2013 P11.97 million. The other contractors submitted bids over P12 million or P13 million (around $278,000).,The audit team was constituted after Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales requested from then COA chair Ma. Gracia Pulido-Tan the conduct of a special audit on the construction of the parking building based on the complaint filed by Renato Bondal and Nicolas Enciso in July 2014. Audit field work was done for 90 days and an exit conference done on January 12, 2016.,Presidential candidate, immunity,Reacting to the COA report, the younger Binay also said it is \"an issue for us.\" He said he found \"highly questionable\" these investigations, considering that \"the vice president is running for president.\" ,In latest presidential preference surveys, Binay has caught up with front-runner Senator Grace Poe. An ABS-CBN-commissioned national survey conducted by ,Pulse Asia, from February 16-27 showed him and Poe statistically tied for top spot at 24% and 26%, respectively.,On whether Binay can be removed from office on account of the cases, there are different schools of thought.  Some constitutionalists believe he ,does not enjoy immunity, from suit because unlike the president, he does not have \"multifarious duties and powers.\",But election lawyer ,Romulo Macalintal, said the Vice President is immune from criminal suit, but not from impeachment \u2013 just like the President.,Pressure?,The Office of the Ombudsman over the weekend refuted claims by Binay's camp they were exerting pressure on COA to release its report.

{"content": "\nContributor Voltaire Tayag gives a rundown of the ladies who are vying for the title one more time     ,ONE MORE SHOT. Mariel de Leon, Jehza Huelar, Charmaine Elima, and Dindi Pajares are just of the returnees in this year's Bb Pilipinas competition. Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler ,Binibining Pilipinas 2017 promises to be a year filled with beautiful surprises. The 39 outstanding young women paraded in their swimsuits during the traditional Press Presentation held at the Novotel Manila Araneta Center on Wednesday, March 22.  ,Binibining Pilipinas Charities Incorporated (BPCI) Chairwoman Stella Marquez Araneta gave a very warm message to the media, sponsors, guests, the candidates, and the woman who they all want to follow, Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach.  ,Stella said: \u201cI\u2019m very, very happy to see how many of our friends have come here to meet, greet, and know what kind of candidates we have this year. I would like to start by saying that I am very, very proud of this group. I wish I could have crowns for all of you because this is a fantastic line-up this year.\u201d,I believe Madam Stella\u2019s sentiments because this is one of the strongest batches we\u2019ve had in years. The candidates are so well-trained, beautiful, confident, and empowered that even a semifinalist can compete internationally and win.,It isn\u2019t surprising to see this high caliber of candidates because this year is dominated by Bb Pilipinas returnees (candidates who have competed in previous Bb Pilipinas editions) and crossover beauties (candidates who have participated in other pageants).  ,Malcom Gladwell\u2019s book, ,Outliers,, suggests that to achieve greatness and success, one has to devote an enormous amount of time (10,000 hour rule) and come from a similar set of backgrounds. These ladies definitely fit that outlier mold.  ,We can say that a majority of the recent winners are, in fact, outliers. Venus Raj (Bb Pilipinas-Universe 2010) and Ariella Arida (Bb Pilipinas-Universe 2013) both competed in Miss Philippines Earth prior to winning their titles. On the other hand, Janine Tugonon (2011, 2012) won Bb Pilipinas-Universe on her second try. Proving that the third time\u2019s a charm are MJ Lastimosa (2011, 2012, 2014) and Pia Wurtzbach (2013, 2014 and 2015), both of whom won on their third attempt.,Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach, (and all these successful returnees and crossovers) debunked any notion that a non-placement in previous years doesn\u2019t make you any less.  Have they reached the 10,000 hour rule? It doesn\u2019t guarantee a win, but it does give you a better chance because you that much more prepared and determined to win.,The Returnees,In sports, athletes are celebrated for their drive, determination and perseverance for honing their skills for years.  It\u2019s about time that pageant returnees are also given the respect they deserve for enduring losses and bashing on social media. It takes a strong sense of self, the discipline of maintaining a pageant body, and subjecting oneself to being judged by others.,This year, there are 8 candidates who are on their second attempt and two candidates on their third try.  ,#15 ,Maria Angelica de Leon, ,23 years old, Las Pinas City, Metro Manila,Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler ,She first competed in the Gold Batch of Bb Pilipinas in 2013 where she was a semifinalist. Each time Mariel was on stage or in the room, there were audible gasps from the audience and onlookers and a great admiration for her beauty. She wows with her beauty but you fall in love with her kind aura and very humble demeanor. She\u2019s a classically trained opera singer and will most likely sing her favorite aria during the talent portion. Mariel ,calls herself a goth, and loves watching horror films. She is a top favorite for the major crowns. ,I asked Mariel why she decided to join again, and she said, \u201cIt was this just this year when I realized that I should try again. I was definitely inspired by Pia and I felt something in my heart. It was like a spark that just went off.\u201d,#32 ,Charmaine Elima,24 years old, Binangonan, Rizal,Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler ,She was a semifinalist from Bb Pilipinas 2013 and is now a major frontrunner. Maine came prepared with amazing hair and a killer body. She has great stage presence but unfortunately, she is one of the shorter candidates. She is expected to place in the semifinals and possibly win a title. ,#10 Jehza Huelar, ,21 years old, Davao City,Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler ,Jehza was ,2nd Runner-up in last year\u2019s Bb. Pilipinas,. But this year\u2019s batch seems alot more competitive, so it\u2019s going to be a tough battle for her. As was with previous returnees, a runner-up finish does not guarantee a crown the following year. It seems that Jehza\u2019s backstory might be key, given that the pageant\u2019s love a candidate who has a story to share. She lost both her parents to cancer and is the breadwinner for her family. She has a degree in finance and works with a sports foundation that gives millions of balls to children. She believes that sports is essential in the development of the mind and body of a child. ,#24 Dindi Joy Pajares,23 years old, Balanga, Bataan, ,Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler ,Dindi is both a crossover beauty (Miss Phippines Earth 2011 Top 20) and a returnee (competed in 2016).  She was a favorite during the 2016 Bb Pilipinas but finished only as a semifinalist. Dindi has a pretty face, good runway skills, and has a very happy aura. Her second attempt might actually land her one of the crowns. But her biggest competitor might actually be her sister, #10 Kimberly Pajares.  , ,I asked Dindi and Kimberly why they decided to compete in the same year. Dindi replied, \u201cMy sister is 26 years old and it\u2019s her last chance to join\u201d and gave her a hug. It seems that there is no sibling rivalry but a loving support system for each other.  ,#12 Angelique de Leon, ,26 years old, Mandaluyong City,Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler ,This is Angelique\u2019s third and final try. She failed to place in the first two attempts but she continues to forge ahead determined to win a title. Angelique looks very polished and styled very well.  Her ponytail gave her a youthful vibe and her stage presence was that of a confident candidate.  , ,#30 Mae Liezl Ramos, ,26 years old, Naga, Camarines Sur, ,Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler ,Liezl was in the Top 15 in 2014 and failed to place in 2015. She has a pretty face and very long legs. As with the other candidates with the same age, she sort of has an extra boost of motivation to give it her all because this is her last chance to become part of Bb Pilipinas history. She is a licensed nurse from Ateneo de Naga University. She started competing in pageants as a young girl but will she be victorious in her final attempt now that she is a more experienced, confident woman?,Who among the returnees will prove once again that when you try and try and try again, you will eventually become a Bb Pilipinas. Will they follow ,Pia\u2019s high heel steps, and win our 4th Miss Universe crown? Will they become ,Kylie Verzosa\u2019s successor, and be the Philippines 7th Miss International?,Watch out for the continuation of my Bb Pilipinas Assessment at the Press Presentation. Next up are the crossover beauties and the newbies. ,\u2013 Rappler.com, ,Editor's note: A previous version of this article said that Dindy Pajares competed in Binibining Pilipinas 2015.

The other 2 Golden Acts are Time Machine, a dance act from Japan, and Gao Lin and Liu Xin, acrobats from China. ,Gerphil Geraldine Flores: The bearer of classical music,24-year-old Gerphil Geraldine Flores loves her craft so much that she says she'll never stop reaching for her dream. ,Gerphil, a music major (voice) at the University of the Philippines, first joined ,Pilipinas Got Talent, 5 years ago. She said the opportunity was worth it.,\u201cI have to say it was a good experience 5 years ago\u2026I\u2019ve learned a lot. Not only that, I\u2019ve also met some good friends from my co-contestants,\u201d Gerphil shared during the phone interview with Rappler., ,Gerphil she decided to join ,Asia\u2019s Got Talent, because of the oppor,tunity and knows the challenge ahead of her.,\u201cI told myself I\u2019m never going to give up until I reach my dream, And finally when I saw the opportunity, I grabbed it right away.

You\u2019ll never know what\u2019s in store.\u201d,During her audition, the judges were impressed \u2013 especially music producer David Foster, who pressed the golden buzzer to let her move automatically to the semifinals. ,Watch below:, ,The judges gave her a standing ovation after her performance, with her idol David saying,,\",Yes! That\u2019s what I am talking about. ,You certainly did not disappoint anybody in this room. It was really a solid performance and your pitch is great. And I hate people who sing out of tune.  You sang in tune. Good going.\",The other judges were just as blown away, with Vanness saying that she was fit to be in a musical, Melanie C pointing out that Gerphil didn't sound nervous at all, and Anggun saying that it was a beautiful performance.,Gerphil, who is a big fan of David, described the experience as \u201csurreal,\" saying:,\u201cDavid Foster is one of my ultimate idols\u2026 I have no other way of backing out.

I have no idea how you did it. I have no idea how it works, but I know it was absolutely magical.\u201d,Fellow judges Melanie C and Vanness Wu were also in agreement, with Melanie saying that it was mind-blowing and Vanness commenting on how talented the group was at telling stories.,But automatically making it through only strengthened the purpose of Filipino group El Gamma Penumbra (\"Shadow Rays\"), which was to empower the Filipino nation. ,\u201cAng, main goal ,po talaga, is to inspire the audience. ,Kung sa panahon na \u2018to na nawawalan ka nang pag-asa,, ,magbibigay kami ng, performance ,na magpapalakas-loob sa \u2018yo,\" ,they said in their audition tape.,(The main goal is to inspire the audience.

But when she was named the new Bb. Pilipinas International, it was already clear at that point that Maxine would get Universe. (READ:,Miss Universe PH 2016 Maxine Medina on the challenge of a back-to-back win,),True, Maxine did okay with her Q&A but all my colleagues agreed that Kylie answered in a far more confident and winning style. Methinks, though, that the judges \u2013 which included Miss USA Olivia Jordan \u2013 must have already been eyeing the former right from the start. My personal take on the whole pre-final scenario was already circling around the one candidate who ticks all the required boxes of the bigger competition.,I love Kylie Verzosa dearly. But my passionate heart was saying that Maxine Medina is the one with the MU Peg all conveniently sorted out for the decision-makers. And that is also the reason why I really went out on a limb for this lady who will face an uphill battle for a back-to-back win in Miss Universe 2016.,For now, let us give Maxine and all the other ladies the chance to rest from all the demands and pressures of Bb. Pilipinas.,Bb. Pilipinas International 2016 Kylie Verzosa,: Her Destiny,Will Kylie win the 6th Miss International crown for the Philippines? Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,Allow me to start this blog feature with an appropriate quote from bestselling author Paulo Coelho which reads:,\u201c,I can control my destiny, but not my fate. Destiny means there are opportunities to turn right or left, but fate is a one-way street. I believe we all have the choice as to whether we fulfil our destiny, but our fate is sealed.,\u201d \u2013 Paulo Coelho,Kylie Verzosa is destined to be a beauty queen \u2013 and to take momentous circumstances one event at a time- a national titleholder at that. The only question is when she will make it happen. Hers came last Sunday night when she was crowned Bb. Pilipinas International 2016. It might not be the honor she is determined to win, but no matter how you look at it, a victory will always be a victory. And this is where fate enters the picture.,Kylie Verzosa is destined to become a Binibining Pilipinas. And her fate is to represent the country in the next edition of Miss International scheduled to take place in Japan around the last quarter of 2016. It is a mission which \u2013 I definitely believe \u2013 this smart and beautiful lass from Baguio City will take with the utmost level of commitment.,Sure, it would have been a lot more fulfilling to be the Binibini crowned by Miss Universe Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach. But in a competition where the factors involved in selecting who gets what could be as complex as finding golden needles deeply embedded in a haystack, being one of 6 to actually see through the pile and locate one is an achievement other candidates can only dream of.,I have always made an effort to write about things positively. ,As much as possible,. And to read the comments of some individuals across social media saying that Kylie lost in her Bb. Pilipinas bid after not getting the Miss Universe Philippines 2016 sash is like saying that she practically went home empty-handed. She did not. After all, she ended up as one of the best.,And the title she now holds is a responsibility that commands continued diligence to prove that, as the song goes, ,\u201cshe\u2019s the perfect symbol of the people, rich in heritage and love. What lovely, pretty, captivating, so exciting, girl will surely win your heart. Binibining Pilipinas.\u201d,You are our Bb. Pilipinas International 2016, Kylie, and potentially the 6th Miss International of the country in a matter of six months or so.,Accomplish it!,Bb. Pilipinas Supranational 2016 Joanna Eden: Best in Swimsuit too,Can Joanna give the country its second Supranational crown? Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,No one is more pleasantly surprised in winning the Best in Swimsuit award during last Sunday night\u2019s finals than the recipient herself, Joanna Eden, who also bagged the Bb. Pilipinas Supranational 2016 crown. And what\u2019s more, she is the youngest titleholder this year at the age of 19., In her latest Facebook update, Joanna stated the following:,\"The award that I think was more surprising than me getting an actual crown\u2026 Best in Swimsuit 2016! Thank you Benchy and Sir Angelo! #strongerwithgolds, , ,Right after getting the coveted special award (,which almost always guaranteed one of the major titles at stake,), Joanna presented herself in an ,elegant emerald green Mark Bumgarner evening gown that made everyone focus on her even more. At that point, it was already clear that she had indeed become a certified front-runner., ,The chances of winning increased even more when Joanna was only one of two (2) KF entries who entered the Top 15 along with Nichole Manalo (,Aces & Queens grabbed the 13 other spots,). I already concluded \u2013 even before the actual Q&A \u2013 that both of them are sealed for victories, short of knowing which crowns they will get assigned to.,Joanna will only improve before setting her sights for the mission towards year\u2019s end \u2013 getting the country\u2019s 2nd Miss Supranational win. And I bet the organizers of the Europe-based competition are quite happy seeing who will represent the Philippines this year.,May you have the most wonderful journey as Bb. Pilipinas, Joanna!,Bb. Pilipinas Intercontinental 2016 Jennifer Hammond:, Best in Evening Gown too,Jennifer Hammond being crowned by last year's winner Christi Lynn McGarry. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,I remember asking Jennifer Hammond once which among the 6 crowns she wanted to snatch during one of our chats. She initially wanted to get International where she felt most suited to. But as it turned out, BPCI and the Board of Judges had something else in mind for her. Now, the proud representative from Laguna is our Bb. Pilipinas Intercontinental 2016.,With her predecessor, Christi Lynn McGarry, placing 1st Runner-Up during Miss Intercontinental 2015, some people are predicting this early that we could finally win our first in the said competition this coming December. And I also have a good feeling that this tall professional model just might be the one to do it.,But that\u2019s getting far ahead of Jennifer\u2019s fate. Let us celebrate her victory first, on top of nailing the Best in Evening Gown award after flawlessly wearing and giving justice to the red Nat Manilag number that elicited a lot of positive reactions at the Smart Araneta Coliseum last Sunday night.,Consider this Bb. Pilipinas lucky. Aside from being a national titleholder, she also enjoys a loving relationship with boyfriend Ryan Sy (,a Century Tuna Superbods Nat10n finalist,). And by the looks of it, she will have the best of both worlds all throughout her reign.,Congratulations, Jennifer!,Bb. Pilipinas Grand International 2016 Nicole Cordoves,: Vegas-bound for her mission,LAS VEGAS READY. Nicole Cordoves hopes to duplicate the success of Parul Shah in this year's Miss Grand International. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,Many pageant observers expected Nicole Cordoves to land a crown more \u201chighly ranked\u201d than what she actually got. While BPCI usually clarifies that all titles are of equal importance, bear in mind that the ones for Grand International and Globe are newly acquired so their status in the competition is almost tantamount to a probationary period of franchise acquisition. ,Be that as it may, Nicole is already Bb. Pilipinas Grand International 2016 and will be the first Filipina representative to actually experience the mission in Las Vegas instead of the usual Bangkok where the Thai-owned pageant and organization (,led by Nawatt Itsaragrisil,) have their headquarters.,Miss Grand International puts a premium on the anti-war speeches and platforms of its candidates (,at least the ones who make the cut,), and I believe that this is the part where our representative\u2019s skills will come in handy.,And knowing how BPCI will prepare our new wueens for international battle, Nicole will definitely be polished even more as the latter period of the 3rd Quarter approaches.,Expect this former Miss Chinatown Philippines to give it her best. While she quips in jest that the assigned crown makes her feel 8 feet tall, there is nothing she will relish more than proudly saying \u201cNicole Cordoves, 24, Philippines!\u201d,Bb. Pilipinas Globe 2016 Nichole Manalo,: One more crown for the Manalo Sisters,Nichole Manalo is hoping for a back-to-back crown in Miss Globe. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,Everyone already expected Nichole Marie Manalo to win a Bb. Pilipinas 2016 crown. The only question was which among the 6 titles at stake would be assigned to her. As it turned out, she will be one of two (the other one being Miss Universe Philippines 2016 Maxine Medina) scheduled to go for back-to-back victories in their international pageant assignments. She is looking now at duplicating the rank of ,Ann Colis ,who claimed the country\u2019s first Miss Globe honor in Toronto last year.,But let\u2019s get back to the heart of this post. Nichole now completes the record of achievements for the most successful set of sisters in the pageant\u2019s long history. With Bb. Pilipinas World 2002 Katherine Manalo and Bb. Pilipinas Universe 2009 Bianca Manalo, she just added a new feather to their already sparkling caps. And it is amusing to note that she nailed one which wasn\u2019t yet being offered during the respective years of her elder siblings. (READ: ,Beauty queens Bianca, Kate Manalo support younger sister's 2nd Bb Pilipinas bid,),Here now is what Nichole posted on her Facebook account after being named Bb. Pilipinas Globe 2016:,Have a wonderful reign, Nichole. And shine at your brightest once you start competing for Miss Globe 2016!, ,Angelica Alita and Jehza Huelar: The future looks bright for these Bb. Pilipinas 2016 Runners-Up,Angelica Alita with last year's 1st runner-up Hannah Sison. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,I have always been open about my fondness for Angelica Alita and Jehza Huelar throughout the entire Bb. Pilipinas 2016 competition. While I thought that their individual bids for two of the crowns were not fully ripe yet, I knew that there had to be something in store for them in the final tally. True enough, they got rewarded with the two runner-up positions which can be looked at as particularly special because it will allow both to continue in their involvement with BPCI, get deeper into training along with the titleholders and hopefully become more solid contenders for the next edition or two., ,Jehza Huelar with last year's 2nd runner-up Kimverlyn Suiza. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,Alita, 19 and Huelar, 21 hold a lot of promise for their future pageant encounters. They have very positive and grounded personalities that will be appreciated by Madame Stella Marquez de Araneta and the whole team behind Bb. Pilipinas. But for now, they need to diligently serve their placements first before thinking a year or two ahead of time., ,Know that I am so happy for both of you, Angel and Jehza.

{"content": "\nEXCLUSIVE: Data show that total expenses for the parking building exceeded the originally approved budget for the contract (ABC)    ,WHAT SAVINGS? The Makati parking building is allegedly overpriced. File photo by Jose Del/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Did the city government of Makati really save hundreds of millions of pesos for the construction of the controversial \"parking building\" that is now subject of a Senate probe? How much did the city government actually pay Hilmarc\u2019s Construction? ,Depending on who\u2019s talking, the controversial 11-story Makati City Hall parking building cost Makati taxpayers either P2.4 billion ($54.54 million)* or P2.7 billion ($61.36 million). ,Vice President Jejomar Binay, who was then on his last term as Makati mayor 2007, initiated the project in 2007. The project was completed in 2012, with his son, Jejomar Erwin \u201cJunjun\u201d Binay Jr, as mayor. (READ: ,Red flags in \u2018overpriced\u2019 Makati infra projects,),Contradicting his critics that the \"parking building\" was overpriced, Binay has gone on record saying that the city government managed to save P200 million ($4.54 million) as a result of competitive bidding for the \"parking building.\" (READ: ,Binay: Makati even \u2018saved\u2019 P200 million from building,), ,He said the project was also cleared by the Commission on Audit (COA). ,But what do the records show?,Issues,Rappler pored over the contracts and bid documents submitted to the Blue Ribbon and spotted some significant issues:,1) The Makati City government \"saved\" only P2.991 million ($67,977) from the alleged competitive bidding it conducted.,2) The purported savings were wiped out by \"change orders\" in the specifications of the contract. A change order, also known as a variation order or extra work order, refers to the introduction of new work items not included in the original contract due to a change of plans or designs. Change orders are also written agreements between contracting parties for changes in a building construction project. It may involve addition, deletion or alteration in a contract at the time of the bid. Change orders are standard practice in the industry.,3) Due to these change orders, the total expenses for the parking building exceeded the originally approved budget for the contract (ABC). The ABC, as defined in the implementing rules and regulations of the Procurement Law, is \u201cthe lump sum amount that shall cover the design and construction works.\u201d Bids above the ABC are automatically disqualified.,Documents show that the 5-phase project has a total ABC of P2,279,667,187 billion ($51.8 million)., Table 1,*Source: COA Technical Evaluation Reports for Phases 1-5,Hilmarc\u2019s Construction, which cornered all the 5 phases, submitted the following lowest calculated bids as declared by the Makati bids and awards committee. ,The figures above show that the Makati City government and its taxpayers \"saved\" only P2.991 million from the supposed \u201clowest calculated bid\u201d submitted by Hilmarc\u2019s Construction, a far cry from the P200-million savings cited by Binay. Two other supposed bidders contested Phase 1 of the parking building project, but one of the supposed participating construction firms has denied submitting any bid.,Overbudget but within COA limit ,Still, the supposed P2.991 million \u201csavings\u201d incurred further shrank as the construction for the project went on, with \"change orders\" applied by the city government. ,In fact, any savings supposedly incurred were wiped out because of the change orders.,Records show that the 5-phase construction project underwent 3 change contract orders that raised the actual cost of the parking building. The Department of Engineering and Public Works of the Makati City government justified the change order \u201cto suit field conditions.\" ,Table 2,At least in Phases 3 and 5, the change orders even pushed the revised contract amount above the original ABC.,Table 3,If the revised figures of the contracts due to the change orders were added up, they would show that the total expense for the parking building actually amounted to P2,280,089,780.94, or an \"overprice\" of P422,593 ($9,604) when compared to the original ABC for the entire 5-phase project.,Table 4 ,Under the revised IRR of RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, any variation or change order is allowed, provided it does not exceed 10% of the original contract price. ,COA certification,In his highly anticipated speech Thursday, the Vice President attacked his critics for dragging his son into the alleged irregularity and for using political-ally-turned-rivals as pawns in the Senate probe. Binay, who served as Makati mayor from 1986 to 1998, and from 2001 to 2010, is known to be eyeing the presidency in 2016.,Binay said the COA, in the past 5 years, had audited the entire project 10 times and found no anomaly.,But COA Chair Grace Pulido-Tan said a special audit now being conducted for the project has raised \u201cmany questions,\u201d specifically on why the project had to undergo 5 phases. (READ: ,COA: \u201cMany questions\u2019 on Makati building,), ,Contract review reports by resident COA auditors of Makati determined that the ABC pegged by the Makati City government for all the 5 phases were all deemed \u201creasonable\u201d vis-a-vis COA estimated costs.,What does this mean?,COA Resolution 91-92, which governs auditorial review and evaluation of contracts, mandates COA auditors to make a separate costing of a particular government contract or Approved Agency Estimate \u201cfor purposes of determining the reasonableness of a contract price.\u201d,A government project is considered excessive, if the contract exceeds 10% of the COA estimate.,Table 5,Except for Phase 5 where the COA technical team did not provide an estimate, all 4 other phases show they were within the 10% tolerable limit stated in COA Resolution 91-92. However, Phases 3 and 4 were within striking distance of the 10% tolerable limit.,Former Makati bids and awards committee vice chairman Mario Hechanova said bid fixing is a normal practice in the city government, while the former vice mayor, former Binay ally Ernesto Mercado, said the Binays received 13% kickbacks from the infrastructure projects. (READ: ,Former employee: Fixing bids 'usual practice' in Makati,),Binay said the allegations were politically motivated and vowed to clear his name. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,*$1 = P44", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/69672-binay-makati-building-overshoots-budget", "title": "Binay's Makati building overshoots approved budget", "link": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/163879-romero-duno-upsets-chimpa-gonzalez,http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/139638-encantadia-2016-cast-photos-grand-press-con,http://www.rappler.com/nation/161465-pagasa-defends-scientists-amid-project-noah-takeover,http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/english/118095-masturbation-health-benefits"},

Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano says he merely provided 'a venue for expression' to express dissent against President Rodrigo Duterte.

This is the fight for all Filipinos. So I am just one [person]. I am just an instrument.

(READ: ,Gary Alejano, mutineer and ex-Marine, leads impeach bid vs Duterte,) ,Alejano, whose party led the botched Oakwood mutiny in 2003, cited in his complaint the bloody war on drugs, Duterte's alleged involvement in the creation of the Davao Death Squad when he was mayor, and his supposed unexplained wealth in the form of bank deposits and undeclared properties, among others. (READ: ,Highlights: Impeachment complaint vs Duterte,) ,The opposition lawmaker urged his colleagues to assess the impeachment complaint while the 17th Congress is on a 6-week break.,\"I am appealing to the members of the House to consider this impeachment complaint, considering the fact now that it seems that the system of checks and balances is being eroded by the kind of leadership of Duterte right now,\" said Alejano.,\"And we don't want to see someday that Supreme Court and the legislature have been significantly diminished in such a way that we cannot anymore check on the excesses of the executive department.\",Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez already called Alejano's impeachment complaint a form of ,\"stupidity,\", while Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said it seems to be ,part of a \"consolidated\" effort, to discredit Duterte. ,Alejano, however, ,denied trying to destabilize, the government.,Getting more support, , ,According to Alejano, Magdalo had long planned the impeachment complaint against Duterte. One of their members, ,Senator Antonio Trillanes IV,, has repeatedly accused the President of having ,millions of pesos, in unexplained wealth.,But Alejano also said that the ,ousting of 12 House leaders, who did not vote yes to the death penalty bill was a factor in the timing of the complaint's filing. ,\"I think it is a factor because those who feel that they don't have the space anymore in this kind of leadership, I think they will find somebody else [to support them]. But again, I will respect the respective positions of those in the House, especially those ousted from their positions,\" said Alejano. ,He plans to \"go around\" in the next few weeks to rally more support for the impeachment complaint.,\"But as of now, I'm happy I was able to file that finally.
